5,"I am really happy with this mount.  I have had the opportunity to use it with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC One, iPhone 5, and Nokia Lumia 920.  The mount held each phone very well, and I believe that it has enough movement to hold something as big as a Note.  I would point out that because of the way it grabs the phone on the sides, you have to be mindful with phone that has the power button on the side.  It is not a big issue at all, you just have to be aware when you place the phone in the mount.

The only issue I have had with the mount is that it left a mark on the dash of my car.  I had the mount placed on the dash for approximately a month, and it stayed perfectly the whole time, but when I went to reposition it I noticed there was a ring mark left on the dash.  It has now been another month and the ring has finally disappeared.  I tried a number of different cleaners on the ring and none of them seemed to help.  I am not sure if this an issue with the mount, or if the dash of my car is weird, but because of this I have since moved the mount to the windshield.

Despite my issue, I would recommend this mount to anyone looking for something universal.","Good mount, but it keeps the ring on its dash",Really nice car mount for a variety of phones.

Stephen Malkmus is a major talent on the verge of very very big things with this impressive solo debut. To think that the driving force behind underground darlings Pavement could sound this popfriendly simply amazes me. ""The Hook,"" should, without question, be a Top40 single. The CD's closer, ""Deado,"" is a hypnotic groove that sucks you right in. Yul Brenner's rap at the beginning of, ""Jo Jo's Jacket,"" is hilarious. This album has everything.

14,"If you read this book, you will discover how to recognise what is wrong with bad writing, and how to transform it into good writing. Having read this book, I can recall books I have read in the past which used tedious stuffy prose, and convert it mentally into better language. Good prose has an operator, an action, and an object. It does not have passive verbs such as 'is.' If you take the is out and replace with a more active verb, your writing will glitter and glow. Winston Churchill saiTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry 'We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the shores.' Operator we. Action fight. Object beaches. He did not say: 'Hostilities shall be commenced on the coastal perimeter.' Unspecified operator, action, and object. In addition, you can learn much more than this, the academic style has become somewhat too popular, although there may be contexts in which it is appropriate, but if you wish to polish up your prose, and make it vastly more dynamic, you can do this in a matter of hours with this book, and eliminate a lifetime of passive noun styles. Other lessons include using 'is' less, the less you use passive verbs like is, the more powerful, and attention grabbing your prose will become. If you are like me, it will change your whole understanding of writing style, an enable you to make your point clearly, briefly and succinctly, in about half the words you normally use. More active prose leads to a more active and clearer mind. Here on Amazon due to a searching glitch you may come upon an expensive version of this book. You can find a version by the same author, same publisher Longman, almost the same title, and",Great for words,"Express yourself, and save money doing so..."

21,"I Am Going To the DBZ:RB series is not as fun or interesting as the BT series.

Starting off, my biggest gripe with the game is its exclusion of story mode. I am under the impression that they just wanted to do something different with the games main course which is fine, but ""Galaxy Mode"" is practically just random battles.
The mode is not the least bit exciting.

The game looks really. The character models are smooth.

The game controls are decent, but you might find there are many ""small"" things that result to a moderate deal. This is not a pickup and play either. You will have to check out the tutorial/practice modes to learn all the moves.

Further, customizing is not anywhere near as indepth as the BT series. You are limited to how many moves you can do in a fight similar to the way capsules work in the first dbz budokai, and every character has the same health. Three bars.

I would also like to point out that there is no GT characters in the game. However, they do introduce a few new faces
Tarble, Future Gohan, Nail, etc.
Also no Sayian characters with a tail can transform in battle like they could in BT.",No fun or interesting as the DBZ:RB series,Not as good as the Budokai Tenkaichi series
22,"The QUARTET ENDURAGLIDE DRYERASE MARKERS ACCESSORY KIT, FINE TIP, ASSORTED COLORS, 5 PACK 5001M5SK claims to deliver strong, bold color. The green, black and blue did a decent job, however the red was far from bold. I learned some time ago that if you keep your markers face down in a container, when you go to use them they work better, having allowed the ink to collect at the tip. I thought that had been my problem with the red the first time I used it, but later discovered it just did not deliver the color it claimed it would. When I discovered the dry erase markers had a widow on the side to check the ink level, my first thought was what a great idea. Then it occurred to me that for the most part it was irrelevant. Either it works hence there is ink. Or it does not hence there is not. I keep my markers in a container so the nonroll cap is not an added feature for me, however a good concept. One thing I do like about the markers is the size. Not sure if the ink capacity is less than other dry erase markers, but I loved the slim barrel and fine tip. I found them to erase just fine from the white board. The erase is a nice size and works well. The cleaner is a handy compact size. The package is a nice option when you are in need of a new eraser and cleaner.

23,"I used this spray adhesive to attach a large laminated map to several pieces of corkcovered foamboard. I sprayed outside on the front porch  ran inside to do the actual attachment and was glad, since even doing it that way left a funny smell in the house for about an hour afterward. Be prepared to move fast because it goes from wet to very tacky to dry in about a minute, maybe less  and once it is grabbed on to something, it is VERY hard to reposition things that did not line up properly. Despite that, there are some minor curling issues see note at end.

I was able to use this to attach the plasticlaminated map to the cork layer of the backing board, and also used it to easily attach strips of nonprimed wood molding strips to the paper side of the backing board as reinforcement.

NOTE: The map I used is laminated and came rolled up, so I had it laying flat on the floor with weights all the way across  on all 4 corners for 48 hours before attaching it to the backing board  and within 24 hours I was having to tape down some of the edges that were curling loose from the adhesive even though it is very thin and showed almost no signs of curling during the glueing process. However, there have been no signs of the wood strips separating from the backing board.",VERY hard to attach things that did not line up properly,"Works Alright, Takes Some Practice, Not As Strong As Expected"

I have the 1 3/4"" one that gives me lose curls but I just wanted one that gives my hair a straight out of the salon blow dry look so I decided to get this one. My hair has been a little damaged and frizzy from dyeing and this curling iron definitely did the job, giving me that smooth voluminous look! My biggest problem with using curling irons is that sometimes it gives my hair that rough/dry feeling afterwards, but this one definitely does not make my hair feel damaged at all! I was a little skeptical when I was deciding whether to buy this because I have a curling iron of every size already. I did not know if I needed this one, but ever since I got this, I have been using it everyday Laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses.

Packaging is very poor as it consists of white cloth and a gluded lable that is bound to fall off and get stained, the actual CDs lack the songs written on them.  Naturally, there are many highlights, but the attempt to mix rare cuts, out takes, excellent cuts of well known jams, such as Eyes, Cassidy, and Shakedown, and freeform jams is bound to be unfocused.  I love the rare cuts, but as far as the rest is concerned, there really are too many other versions and sources for any deadhead with a decent collection to invest hardearned cash on this.

40,"Ah, the good old days, when simple sprites and ""bleep"" and ""bloop"" sound effects were as good as it got, when nobody complained about spending topdollar on a platforming game that could be beaten in 30minutes, when adding new levels and an increased difficulty but recycling everything else was enough to call a game a fullblown sequel, when magazines were the best if not the only source of gaming news. If the above paragraph made you all warm and fuzzy inside then you need to buy a copy of Retro Game Challenge. Now. The games in this collection are easily as good as anything released in the years they are paying tribute to and are so authentic that you will swear you remember playing them as a kid. The visuals, sound effects, even the slowdown when there are dozens of sprites on the screen, are all recreated with pitch perfect accuracy. But going beyond a mere game collection, Retro Game Challenge let us you relive the experience of gaming in the 80's. You start off with one game, the Galaxian/Galagainspired Cosmic Gate, and a set of 4 challenges to complete beat stage 5, use a warp gate twice, destroy a giant asteroid, and earn 200,000 points. Once you have beaten all four challenges, a new game is ""released"" and you are tasked with completing four more challenges, and so on until all 8 games are unlocked. Once a game is unlocked it is available for play at any time in story mode or freeplay mode and these are COMPLETE games, not minigames!. Along the way, you get access to the fictional GameFan magazine filled with previews of upcoming games basically the games that you will be unlocking and cheats and hints that will help you beat the current set of",No more fun than the old days,This homage to the classics is a classic in its own right
41,"This is an outstanding game. The story is one of the best for a shooter game. Although I think this game is considerably easier than the first, there will still be times where you want to throw the controller through the TV. That is a good thing, if it was too easy it would not feel that you accomplished anything. The first player mode also playable in coop! is fairly long and you will want to play through it again if only to get accomplishments. This game has the same problems the first had with movement. You will unexpectedly get caught up on walls/objects frequently especially when running. This can be frustrating at times and it breaks up your immersion in the game. Side Note: Another problem I have is you must have a Gold account to play coop. I know this is fairly common for XBox games but I do not like having to pay a subscription to play online. I do not want to debate XBox vs. PS3, they BOTH have their pros and cons. Gears 2 also has hoard mode and competitive/versus modes. I have not played any versus modes. Hoard mode is you and up to four others against waves of Locust. Each wave gets progressively harder as you advance. This mode was not as fun as I would have thought. It seems the best way to get to the next wave is to set up a defensive area and wait for them to come to you. I would have preferred to assault the Locust position but the numbers and types of Locust just will not allow that until you have substantially thinned them out. [EditHappy face or smiley I freaking love Hoard mode now. Me and a friend were able to get through all 50",What a great game,Excellent sequel to one of the best games

47,"WinZip maintains a look similar to its previous iterations, a bit oldfashioned, but tried and true with some revamped icons. This was actually nice because I felt right at home jumping in and beginning to use WinZip 18. WinZip integrates into your Windows Explorer just like most compression programs and will replace and enhance your builtin windows zip functionality. The function s that I have found particularly helpful are the following: 1. Add files to recent .zip files. This allows .zip archives to be made from windows explorer rather than within the WinZip program. Files from multiple locations can easily be added to archives. 2. ZipShare. This let us you quickly zip and share files including just a link to a file if stored on the appropriate cloud service, with which WinZip integrates. Unfortunately WinZip charges $10 to integrate this with outlook which I thought was pretty poor form especially for a $60 piece of software. 3. Easily unzip from right click menu. Unzipping from right click menu can be done natively in Windows Explorer but not all formats are supported in Windows and I have not found one yet not supported by WinZip, but with WinZip, you can choose where to extract the file from the menu. Very nice to keep from having multiple nested folders created or to keep from unzipping a large archive directly to your ""downloads"" folder. 4. Resize photos: Very nice, easy to use batch processing feature for photos. If you have need to resize multiple photos, this might add the value to the program necessary for you to purchase. 5. Convert to PDF. You can convert .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, and .pptx files to pdf in batch form from within the program.

Back in 2005, Civilization IV came on to add some musical and graphical enhancements that Civilization III released in 2001 lacked. Back then, I wrote a review about Civilization IV as being a true ripoff in every sense of the worTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry everything from the intentional incomplete original version that required expansion packs to fill it out, to the poor interface that was redundant or logically absent. I also forewarned, in my review, that expansions were imminent. With the original title running at $50 at the time, and the expansions running about $30 each two total, it was a damn insult that they expected us to drop over $100 on a game that was both an insult to our intelligence and a ripoff. However, per my review, after Civ 4 was finally expanded, it turned out to be a pretty sweet game, though I still recommended that nobody buy it, primarily because the modification process of the game was nearly impossible, in any meaningful sense, for the average gamer. Besides the insult to our intelligence. Lastly, I made a prediction that about five years would go by, and the ""complete"" version a fully expanded game would be less than $20, so if you had to have Civilization IV, just wait a while for it to be worth the expenditure. Well, while I recommended that we wait for Civ 5 to come out and hope that it was better and less of a ripoff, I noticed that Civ 4: Complete Edition is being sold for $12.

92,"I would quite easily recommend this game. It has got rave reviews online and I have to say it did not disappoint. We played it for the first time on Boxing Day with my family and after reading the monologue of rules only downside we just got stuck into it and it all came together. Made much more sense and much more enjoyable when we got stuck in and played. Just fair warning, the rules seem a little overwhelming at first especially when you read them out. Much easier if you get the gist and then just start playing. It makes loads more sense.

Game differences from the original works great for me. I kind of purchased this game for these new additions. Most of my friends are new to boardgames so games that are tough/nonforgiving can be too offputting. I really like the use of the stations, tunnels and ferries. The tunnels really add an aspect of luckofthedraw to the game, which is not everyone is favourite but I thought it helped even out the game play between veterans and beginners. It can be frustrating missing out on a tunnel, believe me, I tried 4 times to get one tunnel to win the game but even to my last play, I missed out on the draw. But it made for a very dramatic and suspenseful game, everyone was hanging out to see if I would get it.

I would recommend tallying up your trains at end of game play and recalculating your points. It is easy to forget to move your counter and most of time we have been out a couple of points.",It's been a great game,"After reading all the reviews online, this game did not disappoint.

98,"I am leaving this review to compare the SainSonic SSZ200DLB with the UltraClear HD DLP LINK 3D Glasses. I am using them with an Acer H5380BD Projector on a 115"" diagonal screen. They both work great! Below I will list, what I think, are some pros and cons of each. I needed three pairs so I thought it would be good to try two different brands. I read good reviews on both and what I read was accurate. UltraClear HD DLP LINK 3D Pros: Good image and color Fit very well Charged up very quickly They sync automatically Have a nice rubberized finish Cons: Make the image sightly darker than Sainsonic USB port cover is tricky to open SainSonic SSZ200DLB Pros: Very good image and colors Lightweight Cons: Need to swap left and right syncing They are a little long and may stick out behind your head and move when you lean your head back in your seat They are both nice glasses, the 3D is great on both. I personally like the rubberized finish on the UltraClears. Plus the fact that they sync automatically, even when you leave the room then come back. The SainSonics do not darken the image as much but also do not sync automatically, which may be an issue for children or technically challenged. Its easy to swap left for right, one quick button press, only that some viewers may not spot the difference. The field of view on the SainSonics is slightly larger than the UCs, but its the difference between seeing four feet on either side of the screen vs eight feet on either side. None of my screen gets cut off with either pair. I have not had them long enough to see which one holds a charge longer but I do",Good quality,Great 3D Experience

Despite all the monopolizing and heavyhandedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm. I have yet to find a Microsoft product I did not like... until now. In a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is ""horrible"".

Bravo for you just do not do anything online until they release the second patch yes, there is already one out since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50 of the institutions it claims to support. If you are a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings. I was terribly disappointed in 2005. To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, ""dual category lists"", ""inregister"" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone. What have they been replaced with? I have no clue. As far as I can tell, they have replaced them with a HUGE toolbar a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize and a LOT of white space the register displays about 30 lines max on ""compressed"" view and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen. The home page actually displays less information though it is prettier in a way and the settings ""menu"" is a fiasco again, much like MSN Explorer with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.

113,"I got this for my just turned 5 yr old who likes to play on the computer nick jr, sesame street, etc... but did not really get into ABC Mouse.com for reasons I cannot discern, but also loves her MobiGo, Kindle Fire apps, and is just getting into a Nintendo DS. I was a bit hesitant as i was not sure if the games would be too easy or if they would require a lot of reading which is the issue with most DS games. But it is PERFECT! It is simple enough for her to do all by herself yet the games are not ""baby games"" and pose some challenges  she loves that she can trace the letters and numbers as well as write them on her own. The stylus is attached and is also used as the mouse. The buttons are large and clearly show which activity will be activated by pressing it. She has enjoyed all of the games and i have even ordered a few more Kai Lan and Super Why on ebay. The games are educational but very fun and there are many activities for each disc. You need to install the software for the unit, then install each game disc. Once the games are installed you do not need the discs to play the games, which is really nice. Another great feature is that you can choose to set a password to ensure your child cannot get out of the Fisher Price games and on to your computer if that is a concern for you.

114,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since sometime in the 90's I threw away the floppy disks a long time ago, and I do not recall the earliest date, but it is been a long time. I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe. No Schedules C, D, or E. In the past, the product was functional, even though the ""Premier"" version provided more help and guidance. That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it. But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and efiling. So if you knew what a schedule C or D was it is not that hard you could file your taxes. Now in the name of ""consistency"" this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something almost twice as expensive. I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be ""consistent"" and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version. Please be honest just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money. Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we are supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price. Raising the price is something I would object to but it is just a price increase. It is the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it is not possible to give zero stars.

127,"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System We Have been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 45 months and clean the flexible duct that is routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, I should be doing this if that is all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. You Have got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or did not read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or did not use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cannot come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. That Is simple physics they simply cannot come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY.

128,"I feel like I say this with every book in this seriesthis was not an easy read. One thing I love to hate not really hate, I say this in jest about Cecilia London is that she does not hold back any punches. She gives you raw, real and gritty. This story, like this aptly named book, is very much like the mythical, sacred fire bird the Phoenix. Its about rebirth, the remaking or starting of many things: Carolines journey to mental health, the rebuilding of her relationship with Jack, and the resurgence or hope of things to come for these two and for the rebels and their collective because. And the process is not always pretty or easy or even all that pleasant but so necessary. As a diehard Caroline and Jack fan, there were moments where I simply wanted to jump into the pages and just hug the hell out of one or both of them and then there were times when I wanted to throttle them one more than the other. But in either case, the process and the pain was understandable and no fault of either one of them. For Caroline, she is endured such emotional and physical insanity...the women is broken, shattered into tiny, jagged pieces and she is at a dark and deeply troubled point where the effort to put herself back together is insurmountable. And Jack, Jack, Jackif you love him, seriously how could you not?, your heart will break for him. This man is not perfect but even with his flaws, hes my kind of perfect!

150,"Fountain works and looks great, but the capacity is overstated. I was only able to fit around 96oz in it comfortably. The fountain could hold maybe 110oz if filled to the brim and about to spill over. The pump also sits fairly high up in the fountain further reducing the usable capacity. There needs to be around 3040oz for the pump to work bringing the usable capacity to around 60oz.

I have to refill it at least once a day for my 40lb dog and cat. When only the cat is using the fountain it can go about 5 days before running low.

The biggest reason why I switched to the fountain over my previous 218oz fountain is that it still has water available if the pump fails or there is a power outage. My previous bubbler type fountain would become a paper weight in those situations because the water was inaccessible if not flowing.

The stainless steel bowl makes cleaning much easier than plastic as well.","Water isn't available in some situations, but it still has water if pump fails or there are power outages.",Great fountain with inaccurate listed capacity

154,"This hummingbird feeder is absolutely beautiful. The appearance itself is reason enough to have it hanging in your garden.
It is hand blown glass, and has bits of color that resemble flowers incorporated into the glass globe.
The globe is a perfect fit into the base, and there is no leakage anywhere.
With a bottle brush it is easy to clean, and the base comes apart into two pieces, making the base simple to clean as well.
We have several hummingbird feeders in our front and back yard, and although this is visited on occasion, it gets nowhere near the amount of traffic that our old plastic and glass perky pet feeders get.
At first I though it was because the base on this feeder had flat flowers, as opposed to funnel shaped, but I then realized that one style of perky pet feeder that we have been using also has flat flowers...so I do not know why this one is not used as much. When a hummer does come to it, it drinks deeply, so I know the food is in the right place, but they just do not come to it very often.
The hummingbirds do not mind a bit, but it bugs me. It is a bummer to have a gorgeous bird feeder that seldom feeds the birds.
HOWEVER...I intend to continue using it...if nothing else, it is a lovely piece of yard art.

Even still, it is not worth the trouble to get such bad quality videos. Even the software is very simplistic and not at all helpful.

  I previously gave these a 1 star, but after using a silicone lubricant, I was able to bring this up to par.  The fact you must use this and takes some tinkering to get them moving makes me remove two stars.

I accidentally bought these thinking they were 22 mm bearings.  Well that was not the problem for these unfortunately.

182,"I do not see what all the fuss is about. You could mop the floor or get down on your hands and knees with a big wet towel and do the job much better and much faster!

You have to go so slow with this thing it drives you crazy to suck up all the water. So do not think of this like a vacuum going backandforth really fast.

Think of it about 5 times slower as you vacuum your carpet and that will give you an idea! And the brushes do not clean as well as you think they would clean, as I have had to make two or three passes over spots on the wood floors that with the mop came up instantly because you can put pressure on the spot with a mop, but you cannot put pressure on this at all.

I was really excited about getting it, but after using it a couple times to do the floors, I realized I could do a much better job with big wet bath towels and a dry towel behind me.",A lot healthier than vacuuming for the job,I don't think it's all that...

188,"The prints did not end up as shiny as I would hoped, a mostly dull silver.  But I did get the prints out, so that was nice.

Dremel specific thoughts:

First thing you will notice is that this spool is bigger, both taller and wider, than the dremel spools. But not so wide that it will not fit in the same space. But since it is not nicely suspended by the axle, you will have to prepull out the filament before or while you are doing the print. Kind of a drag. So if you have a spent spool, you can transfer it and solve that problem.

One of the reviews below gave the following recommendation when printing with this filament, and it turned out to be helpful for me when using this with my Dremel Idea Builder: do not preheat the extruder. In other words, as long as I start a print relatively cool, it will work much better. The other helpful hint is to use the build tape reaTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry blue painting tape. But I should be a kill joy and cite the Dremel manual. Never use non dremel filament with this printer, as it may result in equipment and property damage. And then, when you do not use dremel approved stuff you could void the warrentee. Stop making your filament so expensive, huh!",Cool,Bought for Dremel Idea Builder
189,"I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15foot dryer duct run. It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be rewritten and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here is my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise not reverse mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you are screwed. 5. Read 4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing",Clean dryer duct,A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.

195,"I have been using Epson printers for years now, and I have found them highly reliable and very user friendly, and this Work Force 3520 is no exception. Set up For the most part, this is the most complicated process for most people, since setting up a wireless printer for the first time can seem confusing. However it is actually very easy when following the step by step setup guide included in box. When first installing this printer, there are more steps than when you install the software on each additional printer. You set up the network connection only once, then you just add additional computer from which to print from. So even if you have 5 computers in different rooms in your house, they can all be set up to wirelessly print from this same one printer. The trickiest part is usually hooking the printer up to your wireless connection. If you have a password set up on your network your wireless signal in your home from your router take note when logging this Epson into it of whether or not you are typing the letters in capitalized or not. My Epson defaults to all capitalized letters and my network password is all lower case. Something as small as this can keep your printer from accessing your network. However, once connected, my printer has never once dropped the signal, and always stays connected to my network. Printing and ink Printing has always worked perfectly from my Epson 3520. It has all the typical settings for changing how much ink you use each time you print. As others have mentioned, the ink does go fast, but I have found it goes through ink at about the same speed as any other printer I have owned. The reason the Epson seems",Work Force 3520 is right for a professional printer,Fully wireless all-in-one printer

209,"I Have been using TurboTax since it was first published. Some years I find fault with the program but most of the time it just works. My major complaint is the selfadvertising for an endless array of other paid offerings, but I seem to be not even noticing them anymore.

 Since Intuit makes only incremental changes and my tax situation is not complex, it seems to take me a few minutes less each year to complete my taxes because I know the parts of the program I need to use.

 A lot of people have complained of price increases for the program and being forced to buy different, more expensive versions. I find no reason to complain.

 TurboTax has a slight learning curve for new users, but if you follow their guided input and are willing to read the directions both Intuits and the IRS, everything gets done.

 So TurboTax 2014 looks and feels a lot like TurboTax 2013 and 2012, 2011 and years before that.

 And that is a compliment. I use TurboTax every year because it works. Its that simple.

226,"I bought this phone because I do not especially care about having a smartphone or a data plan. I just want to make occasional calls, texts, and possibly take a picture once in a while. This phone does all of that respectably. Call quality is good. Not as nice as many Nokia phones I have owned over the years, but definitely not bad. Texting is easy enough on either keyboard, but not great on either as well. I have had my phone for about a year and a half now. I drop it relatively frequently, and while I have some scuffs, mine has been operating dependably the entire time. I think it is durable enough for most people, but it is not the most rugged phone you could purchase either. After a year and a half, my battery life is still good, too. I am a light user, but I generally only have to charge every 24 days depending on what i have been doing. More use means every other day generally, less means I can get to 4 days or so sometimes. Battery life is still good after this long. It is small enough to pocket comfortable, and large enough to hold comfortably as well. The camera is pretty unimpressive. It will take a picture, but you are really best to not try unless you have got a lot of good daylight. Even with the best conditions, you will still get an okay picture at best. The real reason I would only give this phone low marks is the combination of questionable software design on LG's part, and the really annoying additions that Verizon made to make things even worse.

236,"Thank you to St. Martin's Press via Netgalley for the free review copy in exchange for my honest opinion! When I picked this book up, I was expecting a typical New Adult read, one with mediocre writing, a bad boy hero, a good girl heroine, some instalust/love, and a lot of sex. And sometimes, to be honest, that is all I am looking for. I am very much a mood reader. Still, the ""typical"" New Adult read, for me, anyway, is fun while it lasts but forgettable once it is over. They do not often leave a lasting impression. There are exceptions to this rule, and I am happy to say that ""Until We Break"" was one of them. The way this book led me to believe it was going one way, and then ended up turning in a completely different direction, kept me fascinated! I really was not expecting to be surprised! And I was, so that is great! Let us see, where do I start? Oh how about Luke? Yes, Luke and I did not get off to a great start. To put it mildly, I hated him! He absolutely revolted me, and I did not think there was any way he could be redeemed in my eyes. But, I guess I have more forgiveness in me than I thought, because once I found out whyhe was such an ass, he started to worm his way into my heart. As for Sloane, she was even more surprising than Luke!!!

They were fine but a little difficult to get on right. This winter I have already used them 3 or 4 times. They do not stay on too well after about a mile or so even on flat terrain. I went off the even path onto one that is not cleared. It is sort of uneven from the other people who had been there and from an uneven freezethaw cycle. This was not a difficult path. It was flat but uneven.  One came off about 20 yards in. The other was twisted and almost off. So, if you are going to stay on a cleared path with only a bit of packed snow they work OK. If you have any chance you will have to walk on broken or uneven surfaces, try something else. Also, it is easier to put them on before you put on your shoes or boots to be sure they are even.","So, you're going to have a good chance of walking on broken or uneven surfaces",OK for limited use

272,"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System We Have been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 45 months and clean the flexible duct that is routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, I should be doing this if that is all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. You Have got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or did not read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or did not use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cannot come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. That Is simple physics they simply cannot come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high,",Good Seller!!,5 stars isn't enough to rate this product! It's saved me A LOT of money!

279,"I found Sophie's Turn to be a smart and sassy read.  It is a sweet romantic story about a girl who does not know her own mind and she is trying to define herself and her moral high road while opportunity knocks. Sophie is one of those people that just does not quite know how to avoid temptation.  Is she bored? maybe.  Does she just want to make sure, she is not settling?  Yeah...who would not want the best there is for the rest of their life.  I related to her wholeheartedly.  Sometimes we take three steps back to finally come one decided step forward.  Yeah, I could relate to her quite well.

Ms Wells writing developed her characters well and showed the growth in Sophie throughout the pages and I was quite taken by the local lingo used throughout the book British.

289,"Highly recommended at this price point! Heats well, uses a very quiet cylinder fan, and shuts off when not heating. There is only one fan speed for high and low heat so it will either be quiet enough for you, or not. The fan stays on for a short time after the automatic temp is reached then shuts off. The oscillating feature covers 90 degrees which is more than ample. The heat is directed in a slightly upward direction which others have found useful for direct heating when seated. I found the directions very helpful and straight forward. It is nice to have the remote and the timing function as well as the automatic thermostat function. Mine worked fine right out of the box. Overall, I could not ask for more. Now, I just hope it lasts a long time. Excellent value if it does!",Love it,Exceptional value at this price point!

But, there is always the exception and The Fugitive is just that. Harrison and Jones make an unexpected A team. Their acting styles and deliveries are polar opposites, and yet they create something deeply moving and real in the narrative of this film. It never fails to hold my attention, not just from a visual perspective, but in the telling of a really good story rooted in human frailties and the misgivings we have about others. As a 20plus year old film, it continues to hold up and contend with anything in the same genre being made today. I also believe that Fugitive and the 1985 film, Witness, have established Ford as an actor of great range in his craft.",Very Good,A Five-Star Fugitive

299,"Six Moon Summer This is a great start to the series! I have to admit, some parts of the book were pretty predictable, such as the werewolf's true identity, but even with the predictability, this was a fun and action packed read. I really enjoyed Rylie and Seth as characters. Such a starcrossed love! The wolf and the hunter. I really like this dynamic. One complaint I was going to make was that the book seemed so short! When I finished, I wondered if it was a novella, I read it so quickly, but then I looked at the page length and realized that I was wrong. It is a full length book at nearly 200 pages, but I was so into the book that I read it very quickly. Again, a great start to the series! I am so glad I have the entire series so I can eat it up. I cannot wait to start book two! All Hallows Moon Wow! Here I thought my mama was a pain in the butt, but she has nothing on Eleanor! This is a great sequel to the first book where Seth has to choose sides between the girl he is falling in love with and his hunter family. Just like the first book, this is a fast and action packed read. I was not able to put it down, reading it in a single sitting. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little bit more lore behind the All Hallows Moon, but even without the lore, it was a great read. I just feel that adding some lore would put these books into an amazing place. Fun read, definitely recommended. Long Night Moon This is another great installment of the series!

334,"I bought this coverup for a bit of modesty when walking between the pool and the hotel room while on vacation with the family. It was adequate for that purpose, but honestly I would not repurchase this.

Positives:
I like that it has a hood, a full zipper and very roomy pockets for your room key and such. It is very warm and comfortable and is a true black I wanted the black for the heat absorbing properties and it seemed to help in that regard. Overall it is very cute and the longer sleeves are nice to have.

Negatives:
It is not very water absorbent, which to me is a big negative for a swimsuit coverup.  Next time I will be looking for one made of a terry cloth material instead. And I agree with the other reviewers that have said that the sizing is off, I wish that I would have ordered a larger size. Personally I do not want a snug fit when wearing a coverup.

Overall, I think this coverup is just ok. It served its purpose in covering my swimsuit, but that is about it. Maybe I just expected more from a Speedo brand product.

No disclosure needed  I am a reviewer of Amazon products and often get things at a discount, however this item I have bought at FULL price for my own personal use.

349,"The fan moves a tremendous amount of cool morning air through our home, but it is very very loud. So loud that my family avoids running it which defeats the purpose of having it massive reduction in AC cost. The noise is generated by: 1 The fan motor/pulley/blade assembly. It is just loud. I have checked with a contractor and he indicates that that is the case for all fans of this type. 2 The louvers are made of very flimsy light weight metal. They rattle quite a bit when the fan is running. Our louvers were damaged during shipping. We have not installed the replacements yet...hope that reduces the rattling noise. A friend of mine has a similar fan and he solved the noise problem by mounted the fan in his attic and running a big duct from the fan to the louvers mounted in the ceiling. This really works well and significantly reduces the noise by isolating the noise and vibration in the attic vs in the ceiling right above where you live, sleep, etc. Unfortunately I do not have space in my attic to perform a similar install so I am stuck with the noise. It really is loud...if you are standing directly beneath the fan, you have to raise your voice to be heard. Forget about running the fan at night anywhere near your bedrooms especially if anyone in your household is a light sleeper. Finally, I must point out that the customer service people at Cool Attic where accommodating, responsive and helpful. My fan arrived with a damaged set of louvers and they did not hesitate to send a replacement set immediately. They also offered to send a replacement bearing assembly to quiet the noise from the fan, but they indicated that this probably would",Very noisy...,Really Loud But Effective

371,"This is the most visually stunning game I have ever played... period.  The backgrounds are so engaging they are almost a distraction.  The colors and textures are rich and beautiful.  The lights and special effects are amazingly realistic.  The characters are smooth and engaging.
I recently purchased one of the mnay Geoforce2 cards on the market this game plays like a dream.  Upgrading from an older TNT2 made a tremendous difference.  Giants seems custom made for the features of the Geoforce2 cards.
Giants has raised the bar in graphics and gameplay, which may strike some the wrong way.  Those of you who with computers barely ahead of the obsolescence curve, might feel a bit left behind.  Those of you who are still running on older video cards, like I was,  might have some problems.  Unfortunately, it is the nature of the beast.
Aside from graphics, Giants presents and engaging and hilarious story with excellent gameplay.  Just when I felt I would conquered one aspect, the game switches gears, races, or genres and suddenly becomes a new game.  Giants hints at being a first person shooter, a racing game, a strategy game, and an adventure game.  Unlike many games that have tried to combine different elements and failed, Giants makes each transition smoothly and succesfully.
So, the bottom line: if you have a newer computer with a decent video card, you will probably love this game.  If you have been thinking of getting a new computer because your current one is lagging behind, you might want to reconsider purchasing Giants.  Giants could still prove to be fun, but without the incredible graphics, you might feel that you are missing something.","Giants is a fun, highly engaging and thrilling game.",Stunning and Demanding

381,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

384,"Unfinished, buggy, and unsupported. I cannot believe I preordered this game; big mistake. But AC was sort of is, in spite of everything my favorite PS3 series. It was fun, until 18 hours in at memory 4. Then it started freezing and crashing. Then it crashed during a save and I had to start over. This kind of crap, is why I gave up on the Sims franchise. Being forced to back up saves and replay, just to complete the game is just taking away any fun I am having. I have not spoiled myself, but it does not even sound like this torture is worth the story based on reviews that did not give away what they were disappointed with. I gave Ubisoft support a chance and they ignored all my questions about the freezing and just focused on yes, the save is corrupt; you will have to start over, ticket closed. They opted for silence 3 strikes. Some honest acknowledgement and letting me know they are not going to fix it, would at least renew a smidgen of goodwill. At least make me not feel like a chump owning ACIII, which at least I know was not a one year rush cash grab and has support.

387,"BRIEFLY To answer the obvious question [does it work?] yes, it does. If a mouse goes inside, attracted by the peanut butter bait ahhh... the smell of it and places its front legs on one electrode and the rear legs or maybe the tail on the other electrode, then the mouse gets zapped and dies. We saw it happen once with this trap. If we are to refine the question and ask ""does it work better than a much less expensive mouse trap?"", then that is where we need to discuss this specific brand because, as far as actually catching mice, the answer does not seem to be 'yes'. OUR ETongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberryERIENCE We only have the occasional field mice in our basement, possibly attracted by the warmth in the winter but, unless chased away or caught, seem to settle and grow families, which we do not want to see happen. We have been quite successful at trapping them and, recently, discouraging them from settling in the first place via an ultrasoundproducing device but, before we did that, we did not like the fact that the cheap, underadollar spring traps had to be moved around and even taken away after a couple of catches because the mice seemed to learn what the traps were about and to avoid them. So, we ordered the Victor because we hoped that, since the other mice could not see their dead comrade, they would be more likely to give it a try. For a test, we placed the Victor and a cheap trap, about 6 feet from each other. We used the same bait peanut butter and... the cheap trap caught 2 mice in 2 weeks while Victor caught one.

388,"This is one of those books which unquestionably deserves a fivestar rating.  Timothy Good does a superb job in presenting detailed accounts of many UFO and USO cases, while including sketches and photos as well as references and footnotes.  The book is arranged into three sections, each representing a chronological block 19301949; 19501959; 19602006. The material is presented within the theme of the military and government secrecy, which helps to explain why there is not as much physical evidence or witness testimony in many casessince, more often than not, the military would whisk away the physical evidence and threaten witnesses should they go public.  In my mind, the real reason why we do not have full disclosure of UFOs is because if people found out that advanced civilizations and technology existed, there would be an end to the bigbusiness ""Illuminati"" monopoly on things like energy, health care, religion and money.  This book is a musthave reference for anyone interested in the subject, and it is truly hard to put down once you begin reading it!",Great book,Great Compendium of UFO Events!

I have even used another AHAVA formula and thought it was good, but nothing so far has compared  to the Dermud cream.  My hands also feel really good when I rub it all over my hands after applying it to my feet.  Of course, I would prefer if it was not so expensive, but I use MUCH less of it than the Gold Bond, so the price might even equal out somewhat.

399,"Like many other movies that came out during the 1980s, I only recently watched Blade Runner, for the first time, a few years ago. I guess that you can say that either I am extremely naive...or have lived a very 'sheltered' life. Before watching Blade Runner for the first time, I had the impression based on countless reviews by critics and the general public that it was one of the most underrated and greatest scifi movies of all time. After having...'somehow' coughWink or smirk managed to force myself to watch the entire movie, my impression of the intelligence of mankind lowered exponentially as it has many times in recent years, needless to say. Blade Runner starts out as an eery scifi flic showing potential that it may well, indeed, turn out to paint a very original, accurate and ominous portrayal of the future: The futuristicallyrendered cityscapes are very well done even for the present year, 2009, they still do not look very dated, the synthesizer palettes by Vangelis create an ominous atmosphere that goes well with the beginning of the the movie...and some of the first scenes seem to suggest that the movie will be very futuristic and intellectual in a number of ways. Once the miscast droning dialogue from Harrison Ford who plays Rick Deckard, a detective who is narrative dialogue is supposed to sound intelligent, but comes across as that of a dumb rogue more befitting of Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark enters the movie...it goes downhill...very quickly... Rick Deckard's mission is to eliminate ""replicants."" After the first half hour of the film the only part of the film that has anything intellectual, thematic, or atmospheric going for it, the entire plot goes downhill very quickly and the remainder of the film focuses on Harrison","Fantastic movie, not a great film",DUMB '80s schlock-fest

This box holds six different items about 2cups each, there is a place for ice underneath all the individual boxes in the main container, there is a rolling lid that falls back into the back of the box, and you can either have two handles on it or you can put the caddies on and place napkins, toothpicks, straws, or whatever you would like on both ends. It is made of very heavy duty construction materials which I really appreciated especially coming through the mail. It arrived with absolutely no damage whatsoever. This box kept all of my toppings for pizza completely cold the whole time we made six pizzas, had company who was over at my house eating them, and afterwards until I could get around to cleaning up. Each time I made a pizza I could feel that the ingredients were absolutely cold, therefore, safe. I cannot recommend this box made by San Jamar enough. It is the first time I had purchased anything from them and I have to say I am quite pleased with this. Everyone complimented me on this item.

I stopped at that point and put on Disc 2 followed by 3 and 4, all of which satisfied me immensely.  If this had been issued as a set of those three, at the same price, I would have given it five stars since it is still an excellent buy.

I do believe, however, that potential buyers should be forewarned.

443,"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 rightangles before going through the floor into the flexible dryervent hose coming from the dryer. I cannot get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up. Then I pulled it all out and there was not any lint at all that came out. So now I am resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

With this, she grabs it between her paws and just goes to town.

It is nice because it is sturdy enough to stand up to even the strongest chewers for a long time I order a new one every few months for a pit who chews it every night, that is amazing! BUT the dog can still ""make progress"" on breaking it down. My dog seems to only find fulfillment in toys that she can see herself having an effect on for example, she has no interest in the black Kong I bought her unless I fill it with food because it is too indestructible.

I also like that this comes in yummy flavors and is designed to be easy for dogs to hold. The shape eliminates her tendency to try to wedge a chew toy up against me for leverage, getting me all slobbery in the process. I hate that. With this, she is an ""independent woman.""

My spoiled dog gets all kinds of things constantly, and this is by far her favorite of anything I have ever tried. On the other hand, my friend's yellow lab got one and has no interest in it at all, so YMMV. But, for the price, it is worth trying.","Great toy, docile as can be but loves it every day",Hands down my dog's favorite toy

You definitely do not need too much product. I pump once and pat it around both areas around the eye and it leaves it feeling hydrated and smooth. The smell is soft and light and the cream does not irritate my eyes which has become a problem over the past few years. I also noticed it is helping to diminish the dark circles too!

499,"A few minutes ago, as I was preparing to sit down to write this review, my husband admitted to me that he was curious about these products and had used the breast firming cream on the loose skin under his chin. He is impressed! I have been using it as well mostly in the areas of my deacute;colletage and we have both noticed the firming up of that skin. It is a cool gel that goes on with little fragrance. I use a single pump on my neck and collar area and work it in until it has fully absorbed. You can even feel a tightening sensation. I would recommend the ""breast serum"" very highly to anyone who is interested in toning up those tender skin areas under the chin. It would also benefit those who have recently lost weight and have a little bit of extra skin to contend with every day. I give this half of the review 5 stars. The Stretch Mark Prevention cream is very nice too but I do not know how revolutionary it is. It has a stronger fragrance than the bust cream and goes on smoothly with fast absorption. It does not make your hands feel greasy. The fragrance is a bit much when used on the top part of the body it is easier to take if you keep in the belly, saddle and upper thigh area. It contains agents that help promote your skin to manufacture collagen and encourages elasticity. It also has shea butter in it to moisturize the skin. A regular routine using high quality ingredients like these should help reduce or eliminate stretch marks. I would give this product 4 stars on its own.

504,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
505,"I have a fairly small yard but LOTS of leaves. This mulcher has performed exactly as I had hoped when I ordered it. Some complained that it was very difficult to assemble. I am a small woman and no spring chicken. It took me about half an hour to assemble this mulcher with no help. I admit that at each stage I thought, ""Well, the hard part's over,"" and then I found the next stage equally difficult. Still, I never stooped to requesting help from my alwaysreadytohelpanyone neighbor guy, and the mulcher has not yet fallen apart or even wobbled. I used this mulcher on dry leaves, then later on dry/damp mixed, and never had a clogging problem. It definitely reduced large volumes of leaves to a very small pile which I will eventually spread on my planting areas. It is light weight enough for me to move it from place to place easily. The last of my leaves have dropped and I still have a final pickup to do, but I will have to wait until the snow melts! Then I will add to my small pile of shredded leaves, recover the pile with plastic, and wait until warmer weather to spread the finely shredded leaves over my planting areas. For my purposes, mulch is more for reducing weed growth and preserving soil moisture than for winter protection of roots. So far, this mulcher has been perfect and exactly what I needed. FOLLOWUP: A year later, my husband and I were shredding leaves together when it stopped and refused to restarta couple of weeks out of warranty I added a negative COMMENT after my review. We could not find the reset button and my husband disassembled the shredder trying to get to the button. The disassembled shredder sat on",LOTS of leaves,Exactly what I needed

It does everything I expect higher end webmanaged switches to do, and is extremely affordable.

512,"When it comes to sewing, I am a permanent newbie! This is my third machine and until now I could not figure out the buttonhole attachment this machine had much clearer directions than any I would seen before. My prior machines were both Brother brand. The first was on the low end of machines the kind that cost under $100. The second was a step or two up including features like an lcd display. Now with this machine it is the first time I am trying a Singer brand. Feature wise it is close to my last Brother machine Brother HC1850. The first thing you will notice about this machine is that it is fairly heavy. Amazon lists the last Brother machine I owned at about 10 lbs. while this machine is listed at 20. It comes with the now mandatory ""accessory pack"" which is primarily made up of different feet and things that are not exactly optional accessories like the power cord. I have never bothered to learn why the different feet are necessary beyond the obvious ones like the buttonhole maker. Nor have I learned to identify them. Luckily, they are either marked or explained in the instruction booklet. The on screen display tells you which one you need for each stitch. Also included are some starter needles, a screwdriver, a couple of bobbins, a dust cover, etc. While the feet are the typical snap on types, I did find them a little trickier to snap into place than with my prior machines. It is still pretty easy to attach them, they just feel like they need a little more pressure than my Brother machines required. The touch screen display is colored only in that it matches the color of the machine. Probably was not necessary to do",This is my third machine and until now I could not figure out the buttonhole attachment this had much clearer directions than any other...,An excellent machine.

514,"Update  One Year Later:

It is been over a year and I have work these shoes at least 25 times.  They show almost NO sign of wear! Kudos to Ecco for creating a show that holdsup well.

Original review:

Comfortable and fit is perfect. My first pair lasted for years on my daily shoe rotation.  I am a solid 44 in ECCO and these are no different.  They also last a long time and do not wear out quickly.  The footbeds are removable which is a good thing.  Arch support is not builtin unless you use your own orthotics, so if you have high arches, you may want to invest in orthotics.  These come out of the box for someone with low arches.  You can take these on vacation and walk all day without discomfort.

This model is too casual for a jacket and tie and/or a suit.  A perfect compliment is to pair these jeans or khakis.",Very comfortable and can be worn out,Last For (Almost) Ever - Edited

516,"Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to clean a 21 foot long vent,Worked like a charm
517,"I have been a longtime and very frustrated Roxio user who, after crash 953, finally got fed up and decided to try the trial version of Sony Vegas Pro 8. Vegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higherend product than Roxio Easy Media Creator version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes, but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider: 1. First and foremost, if you are serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must. Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus. 2. The controls are far more intuitive. Creating a slowmotion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrlclicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length. Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits. 3. Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8. Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyperthread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time. Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride. 4. RENDERING. OH, YES, RENDERING. Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be rerendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG2 to start with. VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS if it is already in the right format, it will not ruin the quality by recompressing. 5. RENDER QUALITY. Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding. Period.

523,"for a small price. I got it at 29.95.  IT IS MADE IN CHINA, for those who care, I do not.  And no it is not deceptive advertising.  It reads ""You can risk buying cheap flashlights that ship directly from China..."".  All this means is that you are not getting the shipment from China.  But off my soapbox.

This is a great light.  The zoom unlike some others is a twist zoom like a maglite.  There are markings like a torque wrench which make it easier to get to the same zoom level every time.  Also I like the fact that you can use either a rechargeable 18650 LiOn battery, or 3 AAA batteries batteries not included, but the AAA battery holder is, just do not throw it out.  You will have to use the included body extender for the 18650.  It is small about 4 inches so it easily fits into your hand which I too think is great.  Furthermore, the switch is recessed enough so it can stand on end.  I could probably go on, and on, about this light.  But I think this is already getting too long so I will stop.

524,"This book is best suited for girls, and I would assume very few boys would pick it up, with the cover looking like it does. However, as soon as you begin reading, you are hooked. The main character is honest, inspiring, and just lost enough to identify with. I enjoyed this as an adult, and believe any teen or preteen would also enjoy it.

The story moves along easily with little jilting, without skipping over or assuming too much. I was surprised by the ending, and yet it was not too farfetched at all. I would describe the book as a mystery, young romance, and simple fiction all wrapped into one. I enjoyed reading about Samara's spiritual journey as well, as I too questioned the Lord when I was growing up, and was expected to accept Him as real, without thought. It is a good mature look at your Faith Walk without presuming too much one way or another.

An excellent, fun read! I will hold on to my copy so that when my own daughter becomes 12 or so, she will enjoy it as well.

530,"Norton Security with Backup is the latest incarnation of Norton 360. Well, that may be over simplified. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup. This application comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS iPhone/iPad and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I will share my experience with these. Windows Setup: Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works.

I was in an accident a few years ago and my fingers cannot quite handle the remote as it comes from Apple, but the larger size of this case with the extended ""feet"" under the front and back ends of the case make it very easy for me to hold and use the remote.

The white color helps to find the remote when it wanders into the dark colored sofa cushions. I suppose the lanyard would be useful for those who play games that require a lot of arm swinging and hand gestures, but I found it a bit too long and cumbersome, so I removed it after a day of trying it out.

One thing that concerned me when I first installed the case is the way it wraps around the touchpad part of the remote. I suppose there is no other way for the case to be installed without possibly falling off the remote, but it creates a lip around the perimeter of the touchpad. So far, it has not resulted in any performance problems with the remote other than it seems to apply a very small amount of pressure to the touchpad click, so I now only have to lightly press when I want to make a selection onscreen.

The sound is better than I expected. It is not awesome, but again, I did not expect awesome  I expected good enough.  I do not have any problem with the plug being in the back  I know some reviews noted that as an issue.

it is easy to pair if you read the directions.

The ""red"" is actually a gorgeous magenta.  I expected this based on the screen color and on other reviews I read.

The ease of switching how it is being played sideways, upside down, etc. is extremely useful.

The cons  almost no battery charge so it really needs to stay plugged in while in use.  There is a good 5 second delay when the speaker is switching to whatever devise I plan to use it with.","Good product, but not awesome",I love it

558,"Reread. I had forgotten this last book in the series. Mostly, it was like reading for the first time. Amazing cast of characters, minus Sophia. Still grates on my nerves. Why would anyone follow this girl is beyond me. Except, of course, the will of heaven. In any case, amazing read. I felt really bad for Dante. The writing was so good it even made my heart heavy after I finished. He was actually a weak man. Spent years loving/ obsessed with Lovarria. He committed murder/ suicide and thought she would forgive him and love him in hell. That was not the case. So much betrayal in the end. It is hell after all. Loved the surprises. I did want Vaughn to kill Santiago in the end. I thought that would have been fitting, but we did not get to see what happened to him or Deagan. As long and sometimes boring Sophia and Ramas venture into hell was, there was more than enough time to tie up loose ends. Especially because, if I Am not mistaken, the series was ending. Amoras was definitely a giant papa bear. Protective without question. Everyone was fightened of him. Rightly so. If I had one complaint, it would be that the Petronus family was not wrapped up. The town was revisisted at the end, but the angel family was not. I did love Uriel and Gabe. So smart and patient. Raph was full of so much anger. I did not know where it came from. It definitely felt like jealousy. In the end, Sophia, to me, was still selfish. I did not like the secrets she kept from Michael. Caused so much pain for Michael as well as the Pastor and Rama. All in all, an amazing journey I was happy to take",Reread this series,My heart goes out to Dante

This was enough to make Charlottes Auntie Patsy begin to think about her own three daughters futures. Patsy Nicholson called a meeting with her daughters, Rachel, Meredith, and Shelly. She told them to aim high. Think old money. But, the daughters maintained they wanted to marry for love. Patsy told them love can always go wrong and let us face it, its better to be miserable in comfort than to be miserable in poverty. Meredith seems to always attract the wrong guy men that take advantage of her goodwill. Her latest, Clint, just broke up with her. After the mother / daughter meeting, she begins reading Why Bitches Get Husbands and Nice Girls Do Not. Ben Forsyth, heir to Bessington Manor, seems to really like her. But, she is taking the book very literally and is literally spurning his every overture. Rachel meets Bens friend, Daniel DAbarnville. Hes really handsome!

Controls are smooth and intuitive, can be learned within half an hour thanks to an extensive and helpful tutorial system, and gameplay retains all the excellent core functionality that is PES/WinningEleven. While I need not stress over the great design in controls and gameplay, I would also like to add that the online for this game has so far been quite good for me. Almost no lag, and little difficulty in finding others to play against.

Wii Sports showed us what can be done in terms of sports games for the Wii, and while EA and other game companies failed time and time again to introduce anything other than cheap tacked on controls, Konami has gone from the ground up and built PES for the Wii, a display of gaming excellence that fits right in with the system.

My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm.

Typically, if you are looking for something like this, then you are more than just the casual gamer, so spending $20 extra dollars on a more sophisticated controller is perfectly reasonable, but $60 more? That is too much, even with fancy designs on it. That is why I love my Razer, it is got six extra programmable buttons, and all buttons on the controller even default Xbox ones can be reprogrammed to anything you want on the fly, which is unbelievable, and there are 3 program profiles so you can switch to between games or situations. I actually use all of the extra buttons, especially the bottom rear ones, and the small one above the right trigger, which is programmed to that one. It makes shooting semiauto weapons like snipers or single fire rifles and just about every other kind of gun so much better since it is a clickable button, not a pressure trigger. I never use my A button or right trigger at all anymore because the new programmed buttons are so much more convenient. It does take getting used to when you first use it, but so it is not as bad as picking up a playstation controller for the first time. Contrary to other users, I actually use ALL the extra buttons. The top ones are Select so I do not have to move my thumb to check scoreboard, info screens, or views on CoD, GTA, or any other game and right trigger for easier shooting, and the bottom buttons are all face buttons A X, Y B, so neither thumb ever moves from the sticks.

628,"I purchased this software to have a robust ability to restore my hard drive completely not just user data in the case of a drive failure. This is what the ""image backup"" functionality is for, to allow you to recreate a fullyoperational version of your system very quickly in the event of a drive failure. As opposed to just a data backup, which still requires you to reinstall the operating system, programs, and all your user settings again from scratch. So, here is my take: 1 First, any of the positive reviews that have not actually tried to use their backups to restore should really not be given much weight. If you can backup fine, but cannot restore, what is the point? 2 I am running Windows Vista with a 1 TB drive, and this program worked fine in creating the image backup. 3 When my drive started throwing off errors, and I replaced it with a new one, I went to my Acronis boot CD to restore from my backup image on an external drive. Part way through the restore wizard, the restore program just froze, for no apparent reason. And I have been completely unable to restore my system from my backup. Here is the experience I had with the technical support: You should know that by default, technical support is only available via email with a 48 hr response time. While this seems reasonable for only paying $40 for a software product, a 48hour response time makes the product fairly meaningless in the event of a failure, as I can easily restore the operating system and programs from scrtach in less time than this and just use the free builtin windows backup for a data restore.

There are a few parts that could be edited slightly better, but I do know most authors on here prefer for their readers to help them out in this aspect.
It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?
I hope to either purchase more in this series if there is one or get the author motivated to write more! Not that this was left with just a cliffhanger or anything, I have just loved how the storyline was developed, and would love to know where this could head into the future. Knowing how the characters have developed, interacted, and have grown leaves me with a lot of hope for more. I always love series/ books where there is a spin off into a similar setting, but with acquaintances that the characters had, or will have.
Overall, this is a great value and I would highly recommend it. It is a great value for the price, and it simply cannot be beat! I will be purchasing more from this author in the future, and look forward to new releases.",I love it,Good read

However my dear Mr Patterson. I must say goodby. I really cannot take anymore of the mayhem. Every book is murder and mayhem and it is starting to get to me.

The only other author I have said goodbye to is Stephen King...... after the Talisman that was it for me. He was just to wierd. After a while it makes you start to think is this person really in his right mind.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be rewritten and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here is my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise not reverse mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you are screwed. 5. Read 4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing",Great manual,A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.

685,"Just like the Game Boy Advance saw three Castlevania games throughout its life cycle, the Nintendo DS bore witness to a whole new trilogy of Castlevania games. It began with this game, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow released in 2005. For many Castlevania fans, it was the tried and true formula with new game play twists and 2 player Vs. support rolled into one excellent experience. If you were never a fan of Castlevania or prefer the old school experience over the ""Metroidvania"" layouts and leveling up of character that has been a staple since Symphony of the Night, you will not like this game one bit. But for the rest of us, this game started a new trilogy for the DS and it is a good thing. The story is short and sweet this time: You control Soma Cruz, a young man who possess the spirit of Dracula. As soon as he realizes this, a cult is on the hunt for him to release the spirit to resurrect Dracula. Thus, you start out in front of a huge castle to explore. Along the way, you can collect a variety of weapons, accessories and souls. The souls can be combined for special attacks and abilities to help you on your quest. Just like the previous games, your character can level up and become stronger. Beat the game and you unlock bonus content/modes alongside the story mode, wireless mode and options. Save your progress anytime you walk into a room marked red on the map. The PROS: Konami did not mess with the formula as much and it plays exactly like the GBA Castlevania games. With the DS, you can look at the map or status screen on the top screen while the action takes place on the bottom screen and with",The game was the.trl as well,A whole new trilogy begins with this excellent DS game

These cups otherwise make for versatile and entertaining play. They keep my toddler occupied for a good 510 minutes at a time nesting and holding them and banging them together. They also work great in the bath because of the holes in the bottoms.

705,"I am writing this review less than 24 hours after receiving the 3D Printer. Let me start off by saying I Am a novice to the world of 3D printing and only stumbled upon it while clicking around on YouTube. After watching a few videos I was hooked and wanted to buy a printer of my own. I searched and searched and then search some more, overanalyzing every type and price point of 3D printer on the market. I looked at $150 DIY kits and $1500 fully assembled and ready to print machines. After weeks of research I knew I wanted a machine that was under $1000, had a heated bed for the ability to print a variety of filaments and at least partially assembled. That brings me to the QIDI line of printers. Although these printers had a strange name and not a name brand at that, they were striking similar to the Makerbots and they had an average 4 star review on Amazon. So I decided on the QIDI brand but now my choice was the QIDI XOne or the QIDI Tech I. I wanted a larger print area than the XOne offered and did not give too much thought to dual extrusion at the time. Another day or two comparing both models and I went for the QIDI Tech I. The printer arrived yesterday packaged very securely. Unboxing was easy and wow this thing is heavy and solid. A couple of minutes later I had the extruders, the handles and acrylic shields attached however I wrestled with turbo fan housing for an hour if only the SD card was packaged on top with a note that said WATCH THE VIDEOS ON THIS CARD BEFORE ASSEMBLY it would have saved me time and frustration. After assembly, power up,",I've received the QIDI Tech X One,Money well spent. You cant go wrong!

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit...,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

In fact, I bought it at WalGreens first and used it...and still using it.  I liked it so much, I did not want to be without it ever again, so I ordered two more from Amazon, at exactly the same price, plus Amazon was the only place I could find the brush replacements at a very reasonable cost.  This brush will make you feel as if you have not been brushing your teeth well enough.  It is not a soft brush, but it is not like brushing your teeth with a cheese grater either.  I was able to get around the bottoms of my teeth into the gum line and it just never felt this great with any of the electrical or battery operated ones still stuffing my closets.

742,"In 2000, I was in high school and at a friend's house, when he played ""Change In The House of Flies"" on his stereo. From the first few seconds, I was hooked and knew I found a band I would fall in love with. I have listened to the Deftones regularly since then, 16 years ago. I have every album of theirs on CD. I had big expectations for this album, ""Gore,"" since it has been about four years since the last Deftones record. First, let me say that ""Gore"" is by no means a terrible album. It has its moments, particularly with songs like ""Phantom Bride"" and ""Hearts/Wires"" which I feel are worthy additions to the Deftones canon. But on the whole, the album does not hit as hard or as beautifully as their previous efforts. The atmosphere it creates is good, but some of these songs just do not hit the mark, like ""Xenon,"" which does not feel like it belongs on a Deftones album, but as a B side. Also, I have to agree with other reviewers that the album does not give enough room to Stephen Carpenter. I can understand why in interviews, Carpenter has said he was not totally on board with recording these songs. He does not feel like a major part of the album, except for a few tracks, like ""Gore."" I am happy I listened to the album, and I am writing this review after listening to the album in its entirety, on two separate occasions, on different days, to make sure I was totally confident with what I was about to write. I cannot help but feel somewhat disappointed with this record, especially considering how long it took the Deftones to release it since Koi No Yokan.

I followed the directions  wash hair, towel dry, apply product, comb through, let sit 510 minutes, rinse. I do not use any heat on my hair, allowing it to air dry. The results were shinier and better controlled hair than I have had in years. My hair looks healthier and prettier. It is far more sleek looking without being flat. It even feels better in my hands.

772,"I have very difficult dry skin due to a health issue genetics and also have eczema on occasion. My skin really loves this lotion, it sinks in a bit deeper and leaves less residue than other body lotions I have used. I also love that it is fragrance free, I work outdoors and sometimes fragrance can attract insects, which is a real pain! Nothing like being attacked by no seeums because you happen to smell like a big flower, boy they love perfume. My skin needs a better quality lotion than I can find OTC, and this one competes well with those I have purchased from spas. In fact, I believe Bioderma is a product that is carried in spas, but I am not entirely sure. I like to give a good exfoliation to my skin before using ANY product because it just would not be fair to review it any other way with a thick layer of dead skin preventing decent absorption. I also like to shave my legs, etc. because my skin tends to resist any appliaction of lotion if I have 'stubble'. Doing both of these preps makes a big difference, and I noticed that my freshly scrubbed and shaven skin does not sting after applying this lotion, so it is gentle. That is an important point since my skin can stay irritated for hours and days once it gets started down that path. I also do not notice any ingrown hairs which can happen to me quite readily the day after shaving if a product clogs my pores. So far that has not happened so I am very pleased. The spots where I have eczema right now an elbow and knee do seem softer and less red and irritated. This is a more occlusive lotion that",I love this lotion and it's free,My skin drinks this up!

Over the years, I saw my worst fears realized as each successive version of Norton Utilities and Norton Antivirus degraded under Symantec's stewardship. That changed in May after my subscription to NIS 2008 expired, and I decided aided by two rebate programsto install NIS 2009. It appears they finally got it right. Installation was easy a first for NIS in several years, the program has added new and welcome security features seemingly without increasing system overhead, and nothing has crashed...yet! The program seems lean and mean, and more important, very effective.

It does have one nasty nasty feature...and that is Symantec's insistence in forcing a subscription renewal at the end of one year. The cost of renewal is ridiculously high, and the sudden loss of protection if action is not taken is unconscionable. Personally, I solved that problem when my subscription to NIS 2008 expired in March. I simply switched to the McAfee program offered free by my Internet provider UNTIL Symantec offered one of its frequent rebate programs, which allowed me to purchase NIS 2009 in May for a net cost of $[...].

It ticks me off that the scum prowling the Internet ruin it for the rest of us by making it absolutely essential to purchase protection.

CorelDRAW has always been the ONLY comparable product to Illustrator, and continues to be so with Suite X8. It is exclusively a Windows program, so if that is the environment you are working in, and you are looking to upgrade to a real graphics program, Suite X8 would be a great choice. As with Illustrator, the learning curve is steep. This is not one of those watered down vector art programs, this is the real deal, meant to give you powerful tools to create a variety of deliverables in unlimited formats. I will not waste space here listing the modules and what they do, since that is available in the above product description from Corel. What I will make note of is the inclusion of AfterShot 2 as a builtin module that is exclusive with this release via Amazon. AfterShot 2 gives you the same kind of photo editing power that you will find in Photoshop, and most notably adds the ability to edit RAW files from nearly every known camera on the planet that will shoot in the RAW format. If you do not know what RAW is, then you will probably never use this feature, but for those who do, it is nice to know Corel has finally added the support for RAW images that have long been available in Illustrator. THE PROS If you are already a CorelDRAW user, Suite X8 is a worthy upgrade. Most of the user interface is identical, with a few enhancements, so you will know your way around.

Also there was a timeline issue I just could not figure out. She was married for 18yrs but was only currently 32yo. No. Probably not. And yes, the typical editorial errors. Ms. Silver is really are an amazing talent and I love most of her books some are just not my style  I do not critique what is not my thing and I understand she does not want to go mainstream, but perhaps having someone read over her writings before she hits publish would not be the worst thing.

It did not feel terribly gritty when I first applied it but after a few minutes it was like I had assaulted my roots with a bottle of 1980's strength hairspray. I waited a few hours to see if that dissipated but it did not and my day 2 hair looked pretty gross and greasy which for me, on day 2, is unusual.

With that being said, she has chosen some pretty big milestone songs in her career. Mary obviously included the song that put her on the map ""Real Love"". Everyone knows this as her first bonafide hit and takes you back to that early 90's sound. She also took such great tracks as ""I am Going Down"", ""Be Happy"", ""Not Gon' Cry"", the gut wrenching: ""No More Drama"", the song we ALL tore the dance floors up to: ""Family Affair"", and she also took us into the now and reinvented the classic ""My Life"" and also included the recent smash: ""Be Without You"". Mary has 4 brand new songs on here with: ""King Queen"" Featuring John Legend, ""You Know"", ""Reflections I Remember"" and ""We Ride I See The Future"".

890,"I read reviews for several different types and one of the reviews on here convinced me that this was the one because it has a filter cup. So far I have made soy, almond and hemp nut milk and all of them taste fantastic. Excluding soaking, it is a 5 minute process for nut milks, and about 20 for soy milk including clean up.

So far I have not seen the green light go off for the soy milk, but we think it is because the water is not warmed when we pour it into the machine. I am not too worried about it though because after 15 minutes even if the light does not turn green I know the milk is ready. For nut milks use less water  as indicated in the instructions, and run the mill setting 5 times 10 seconds each. And voila  nut milk that is delicious especially with some agave that is preservative free.

I use a nut milk bag as a final strain and the grit is completely removed and it is pretty amazing. I also bought an Italian Frigoverre 34 ounce glass pitcher and strain the nut or soy milk after cooling directly into that pitcher. It is the perfect size and sleek design. I have also put the milk into large zip lock bags which work in a pinch.

The amount of milk will not feed a family but I will not keep it for more than a few days so I make a new batch every 1 or 2 days. I also do not make it in the morning because it is too loud in a small apartment setting so I make a fresh batch at night instead.

Will you give me a decent grade if I go and sabotage a coal mine, or at least honor the picket line around our local Walmart, since that is what Zola's passion for social justice inspires me to do? This novel is too grand and powerful to demean with a paltry book report. I am sure that is why there are only two reviews posted here; everyone is intimidated by greatness. ""Germinal"" is widely regarded as Zola's masterpiece. I am inclined to agree. It is surely his most passionate, suspenseful, kinesthetic novel, with a cast of characters so vividly depicted that you would recognize them on a crowded street. The focal character is the young laborer Etienne Lantier the family link to the other novels of Zola's RougonMacquart epic who takes a job, out of desperation, in a coal mine. Zola did his homework on mining technology and working conditions in the mines of mid19th C France. His wordpaintings of the mines are worth a thousand pictures, and the conditions of work are beyond hellish. Life for the miners and their families in the companyowned villages is squalid and brutish, while the luxury enjoyed by the bourgeois managers and stockholders is hatefully excessive. Exploiters and exploited are both trapped in an orgy of moral and psychological corruption. Young Etienne, a selfeducated idealist pushed and yanked every which way by his reading and his contact with utopian socialism, becomes the instigator of a massive strike that begins with orderly optimism but that devolves into misery and violence.

911,"First, Tamiya makes good paint, whether it is spray paint or bottled, acrylic or enamel or lacquer or what have you. I have used several of the company's products and have not been disappointed.

This polycarbonate ""Smoke"" paint is intended to be used on clear model car bodies, apparently  and you paint from the inside? Do not ask me; I do not build model cars. But ship and aircraft modelers have found many uses for the ""Smoke"" paint, including, apparently, simulating oil discharges.

As for me, I bought it to use as an overcoat for a big project I am working on: Building Revell of Germany's 1/72 USS Gato submarine model. Instructions call for painting the lower part of the hull semigloss black, which I did by airbrushing Tamiya's brand of that. Afterward, though, I sprayed a light top coat of the Tamiya Smoke. It really, really brought out the details, which I was concerned about with this project because black paint tends to make things disappear.

Again, all of Tamiya's products have been good to me, including this one. I have heard some complaints about this and other Tamiya paints running, but I did not have that problem.

929,"Anyone who owns a Ford knows that Microsoft Sync is terrible in general and especially when trying to play music from an iPod or iPhone. I was so frustrated with the Sync interface and index system that I finally went to my Ford dealer and talked with one of their Sync specialists. Bottom line is that Sync does not behave anywhere close to how an iPod does when it comes to navigating music lists. The Sync specialist told me that it is a known problem and at least one customer had bought an RCA jack to iPod connector to solve the problem. I did the same and purchased the ZioTek 3 ft. cable. It works great. Solves the problem. Unfortunately, I have a boat anchor of an ""entertainment"" system. It simply does not perform the most fundamental of navigation functions. And I am back to operating my iPod using in the same manner as I did in my previous vehicle via the AUX port. Oh well.

Certainly OS X Panther has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance. But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before. Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems. I can now. Before, I could find things. And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders. If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent. I could see the folders open, one inside the other. And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively. No more. In OS X, I have not a clue. I do have a 750page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther. With a trembling finger on the stepbystep instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully. I know the red buttons close somethingsometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window. Which I have learned to find after a brief but infuriating search. There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I cannot say what they do just now. It is all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason. If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green? Do not bother; logic is no guide in Panther. And that encapsulates the problem. In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized. The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.

Then just get a un amplified or just preamplified signal of the mix from the PA and you are done. This has helped me a lot. With the Behringer MA400 you are in control of your own personal mix and you will always be able to hear yourself.

He produced a lot of the songs that are the soundtrack to the midlate 70s and the early 80s.  I have always thought it was amazing how some songwriters can take very personal and intimate subjects and put them on a level where millions of people can relate to them.  Dan Fogelberg was one of those songwriters.  Not only could he produce albums on which he played every instrument, but he would also surround himself with musicians like Don Henley, Glen Frey, Joe Walsh, Tim Wiesberg, Emmylou Harris and many other of the well known ""west coast"" musicians.

972,"Yes. It is expensive. No matter how you get it. The best deal regularly offered is through the website. If you are affiliated with an academic institution, you can get it for around seventyseven dollars for a whole year. This, as far as I understand, is for all levels and both sides of the dais. I do not know how strict they are on checking up on that, but as far as I have seen, it is only offered through the website. It is worth it. They identify as a centerright 'newspaper' in England. This makes it somewhat of a centerleft paper in the States. My own politics are further to the left than the editorial voice of The Economist, but for my money there is no better weekly news magazine. I grew up stealing my father's Time and Newsweek magazines. I liked them, but have over time shifted towards focusing on popular culture and towards a dumbed downaudience. Perhaps my own expectations grew to be more curious about the world than what the actors on 'Friends' thought about their success. The Economist meets those expectations. They cover the world, in depth. They are still something of an establishment voice, so if you want to reinforce your left or right radical leanings, you need to seek another publication to supplement your views. I for one, keep the Monthly Review. I tried to do it all in one publication, but I dropped the Nation because it was overfocused on the American Left, and I felt siloed. The depth is the selling point. There are several sections covering Africa, Latin America, the YOU. S., Britain, general economic news, science, and the arts.

The shoulder buttons were not as good as they should have been, and at one point one of them fell off from being used too much, and worst of all, the DPad was beyond horrible.

Well no more. The DPad on this controller is much more reliable. Especially for games that requires you to use the DPad often. For example, I play Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 often, and before the other controller's DPad would make me do moves that I did not want to. This one, however, does not give me that problem.

The one downside is the microphone interference. Whenever your using your microphone over live, other players your talking to may here static and such. It is not horrible static, but I am told it is there.

980,"John Meachams stated objective was to neither lionize nor indict Jefferson, but instead to restore him ""to his full and rich role as an American statesman who resists easy categorization."" He has given us a portrait of a complex man. A highly educated man. A man who is among the most accomplished men in history. A man who was arguably, more committed to the ideas and ideals of this country than any other, with the possible exception of James Madison. Jefferson was a state legislator at age 25... author of the Summary View, age 31, the Declaration of Independence at 33 and the Virginia Statute for Religious Liberty... governor of Virginia at age 36... Diplomat to France, Vice President and President of the United States... and, one of his proudest accomplishments, founder of the University of Virginia. He also left a legacy. The obvious: the father of the ideal of individual liberty, the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis and Clark expedition of the American West. The less obvious: Jefferson, and adherents of his, served as president of the United States for 36 years of 40 years: James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Marty Van Buren an accomplishment unmatched in American history. Through all of his accomplishments, Jefferson suffered ""personal and political miseries of 1781 and 1782 the invasions by the British, the aspersions on his character."" He also endured the death multiple children and of his beloved wife. And he had failures: foremost of which was his inability to end slavery. Jefferson was always concerned about the very real possibility that the American experiment would end with a return of a monarchical government.

985,"This seems to be the album which gets nominated as the first genuine punk album. I will not go into who started punk in this review, as I have not really checked out enough acts that get called ""protopunk"". In any case, The Ramones did, from what I have read, have a big impact in the UK, where many of what would become the first wave of British punk, came to see them and hang out with them. That is the YOU.K end of the foundational punk triangle I mentioned in my header. The final side of that punk triangle lies in Australian bands like The Saints and Radio Birdman, who had no first hand contact with The Ramones or that British scene, so cannot really be said to have been influenced by either the Ramones' side or British side of the punk scene. In fact, these Australian acts' releases predated most, if not all UK releases from that part of the world. Basing my following comments on this album from a 2 for 1 release of ""Ramones/Rocket to Russia"", I have to say that I do find The Ramones to have that distinctive punk guitar sound, and lyrical themes associated with the American sense of the word ""punk"" i.e. before the British sense came to be universal, with bands like The Sex Pistols. However, by comparison to The Saints' more seminal sounding debut ""I am Stranded"", I have to say that The Ramones would have been better served taking The Saints' approach to the guitar sound in the mix. With The Saints, their sound is clean, clear, abrasive and to the fore. With The Ramones, unfortunately, it sounds like Mrs Ramone was in the mixing booth and toned down the punk guitar sound as it was a bit 'noisy'",I do not recommend but want to say that this is the first genuine punk album.,The American side of the foundational punk triangle

988,"Jamie Lee Curtis, Is There Really a Human Race''? Joanna Cotler Books, 2006

Man, this book started off so well. Of its thirtytwo pages, fully twentysix of them are great stuff. Playing on the multiple meanings of the word ""race"", Curtis asks all sorts of amusing questions about humanity. While it does get a tad overbearing at times with the moralizing ""If the race is unfair, will I succeed?"" comes flying out of nowhere, for example, it is quick, funny, and wonderfully illustrated by Laura Cornell. Unfortunately, then come the last six pages, where Curtis tosses away the metaphor and dives straight into the moralizing. Show Do not Tell is gasping by the wayside, obviously not having the lung capacity to finish. Sense of Subtlety got knocked over the head by an unscrupulous racer and is lying in the gutter, quietly sobbing. Not Talking Down to Kids lost his jockey and bolted for the track bar. Moralizing and Sanctimoniousness hit the wire in a dead heat.

Still, the first bit's worth it. ",Good book; lots of great stuff,Most of it's great.

Pro:
 Good wind noise reduction when outside
 Pairs very easily with the devices I have tried.
 Reasonable battery life  I can talk for 4 or 5 hours in a day with no problems.

Cons:
 Bad sound quality: I get reports from listeners of echos, clipped speech and low sound volume regularly. I know it is not the cell service b/c when I switch to the device directly listeners say ""Ah, that is much better now.""
 Bulky: it is fairly big as a device around the ear, so wearing sunglasses and this device is not great.
 Annoying: After fully charging overnight, the device will report ""battery medium"" after about an hour of use. To make it worse, it actually says ""Battery medium"" in a British female voice during a call, causing me to miss words of the other party. This cannot be disabled.

I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",Not perfect for the job,Does what it needs to

1015,"Over my vacation last year, I listened to an audio book of lectures by Richard Feynman called ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"". The lectures left me charged with passion about science. One of the most memorable portions of the lectures involved Feynman wondering why so few people saw the beauty of science deeply enough to use it in art. After all, there are many paintings of people or nature, showing their beauty. Why not tell the stories of scientists and their exciting discoveries? Why not show the beauty of mathematics in an interesting, fictional story? When I saw the posters for What the $! Do We Know which I will call WTDWK for brevity, I was very excited. I thought it would be such a movie, that would demonstrate the passions we can feel around science. I had not heard of the title before, and did not know the origin of the movie until I researched it after leaving. Before you spend time or money on it, you should know that the movie was directed by a bunch of newagers who run a cult. J. Z. Knight runs ""Ramtha's School of Enlightment"" in Yelm, Washington. She claims to channel an ancient warrior from Lemuria now presentday Monglia who lived more than thirty thousand years ago. This woman believes and preaches falsehoods and executes irresponsible practices. Statements like: ""It is just a fact that we use less than a tenth of our brain,"" and stories of trusting her child's healthcare to a vision she had during an out of body experience are the brunt of her website. Had I this background before paying for my tickets, I would have been prepared. Instead, I had my lofty hopes for a sciencefocused movie and I was, instead, profoundly disappointed. This movie is",A Science-focused movie...,Pure Bunk

1018,"I have been using LT for over a month now, and I am more than happy with everything it offers, and everything it does not. The simple statement here is that if you do not need to render in 3D, LT is for you. As it is for me.

Let us face it, LT is a slight step down, but for the money, it is quite the bargain for the steps it takes for you in professional drafting. Either way you look at it, you are playing with the big wigs because you can now speak their language. With full DWG compatibility, you are able to associate yourself and others with the most popular file format. If you are dealing with people with limitations, you are the one with the ability to provide previous formats for them to utilize, not the other way around. With LT you can use anything.  And if the people you are providing any of this for have nothing remotely possible to use any of your creations, well, you simply export a PDF version, or even JPG and TIF images. In some cases, you can cater to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  So, obviously, people you are sharing your work with do not have to own this software.  They only need it to interact with your project.

The customization features of the program is topnotch.  The software offers so many powerful features, but it is great to be able to sort and organize to your visual preference.  For my needs, it is above and beyond exceeding my expectations. Do a comparison of your personal needs, and if you can live without 3D models, and 2D will work, this is a great deal, from a longtime trusted maker, with the best service.",Good for your drafting and is perfect.,2D or not 2D?

On this other hand, my time, to build a jig, is worth something and I would be hard pressed to make something as versitile.  I kept thinking about the best way to build a jig for shaping and sharpening skew chisels on my Worksharp.  It seemed anything that would work for multiple skew and bevel angles would take quite a while to get right.  Based on other reviews and Tormek's reputation, I bit the bullet and bought this.

It took me about fifteen minute to figure out how to put it together and set the depth and angle to get the shape I wanted.  It is not intuitive.  It worked as well as expected, meeting my high expectations!  This is a very useful jig.  Once I had it figured out resetting it for a left hand shew and other angles takes only a few minutes.",It's not intuitive,"Beats the heck out of freehand sharpenig of skew chisels but IMHO, still overpriced..."

I use a high end powder from another line and once I get this in the right place I cover then with powder. It does crack if you make it thick. It also looks thick if your skin is oily a while after you put it on. The great thig is it does not irritate or break me out. I rate it highly because of that.

John Grover sure knows how to make things horrifying in quick order.  A mishap in preparing a dead body for viewing at a funeral home allows the mist that hangs in the woods around town to sneak into the body of the deceased and inhabits her flesh and becomes her host.  The body then begins to attack the two morticians, with Mathew, newly moved to the town, witnessing this for the first time.

Action and terror are quick, and the pace is picked up right after the first page and is relentless.  While only 20 pages in length, this story will be over before you know it.

He tries to create a bit of family dynamic with a family member being in inhabited, but that does not come off as well as you would think.  The scenarios created are more of the central focus than the characters, so you do not really get the time to make much of a connection.

The Bottom Line:  Quick to the punch and quick to terrify, The Disembodied is filled with chills that leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  However, there is a companion story in the book of short stories that this is in if you want to learn more about the cursed town on the edge of Murk woods.",Great story,Chills in short order!

1068,"This had fewer completely asinine plot holes than the last. I have read all in the series up to Hell's Foundations. Although ""read"" is a bit strong. There is WAY, WAY! too much nattering insignificant detail just pads the word count Weber must be paid by the word, or perhaps he is under contract to deliver a manuscript with at least X number of words or pages. I hope he is not doing it to just annoy his audience. OTOH, I do find some of the background info interesting, it some of it gives the action more context, when he writes about leaking valves or getting a cart through the mud, but some of it is just way too much of nothing. I have taken to almost completely ignoring the sections written from the proTemple point of view, the book is less painful to progress through that way. But even with that, there is just too much about how many hills are on the left of the road, and whether there is a ditch on the right, how many leaves are on the trees. This is the 7th book of the series, and I am still with it, so it cannot be that bad. OTOH, if it was that good, I would be reading every word. This book is, imho, written a lot better than the last which I gave one star.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.

Lena has been married for 7 years to her college sweetheart. Things have always been good between her and Derrek. However, lately her marriage has changed. It is not the loving marriage that she once had in the beginning. The best way to describe her marriage is....loveless. Lena decides that she does not want to have a ""loveless"" marriage and realizes she wants to fight to put it back to the way it was. Only now, it may be too late. Lena feels that her husband is hiding something from her. She decides to confide in her best friend, Samantha. I really liked the friendship that Lena has with Samantha. Samantha is the friend every girl should have when things start to get tough. I loved the part when Lena is talking to Samantha about her husband and tells her that she has a feeling that he is cheating on her. Samantha says...... ""Well, then. We would better get a rental car, some black turtlenecks and ski masks, and brush up on our stake out skills."" ""What?"" ""We are going to stalk your husband."" LOL! When I read that part, it totally made me laugh. Not because of the situation, but because it is something I can totally see myself saying to my friends!

1096,"Then I read the excerpt at the end of that last book and I felt pretty shattered. It hurt to read what she did with two characters that I loved so much. I was sad, but I knew it would all have to turn out happy in the end.

And I am so, so, so glad that I was right. Jared and Tate are my most favorite New Adult couple. The give and take they have with each other, each challenging, neither holding back. I loved this book, I was really nervous as to how long it would take them to get back together. I am really happy it did not take that long, but at the same time, it almost felt like it happened too fast. It was only a couple weeks tops and they were back to where they left off almost.

I liked that this almost was like Bully, but this time Tate was in charge, and Jared had to deal with her pushing him to his breaking point. I liked that the tables were turned. But at the same time I felt really bad for Jared in this book. He was really trying to make an effort in his really messed up way, and Tate was really mean and not really like herself, I guess that was kind of the point though.

1107,"A great and very entertaining read, which points to the issue that New Agers love and something the book addresses: How to avoid Silly Solipsism? The human mind is a systems property of all the component parts. We know that what goes on in the mindbrain is a series of quantum events in the brain, seea datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/TheMindandtheBrainNeuroplasticityandthePowerofMentalForce/dp/0060988479/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force/anbsp;by Jeffrey Schwartz. Read both books. It is good that the authors keep reinforcing just how shocking quantum theory is, in spite of driving one third of the economy. As the authors explain very clearly, in quantum theory, the photon does not have a ve or ve spin until we decide to measure it, thus collapsing the wavefunction. The term 'particle' and 'wavefunction of the particle' are synonymous, so collapsing the wavefunction solidifies its properties. More than that, it does not have the property of 'spin' until we decide to measure it. We are making up reality as we go along, with one qualification. Once you measure the spin, that is it, objective reality has been formed. I cannot come along a split second later and 'create my reality'. David Bohm resolved the issue of information being transmitted faster than the speed of light by saying that the photons, the measuring devices, and the observer were all part of the same holographic system, and that the information was everywhere, simultaneously. In any external example, you can picture yourself, the laboratory, the photons flying away, some measuring equipment and the observer as all there but somewhat distinct from each other. You cannot do that with a quantum event in your own head, because observing must also be a series of quantum events. When, as a result of all the quantum events, a","A great and very entertaining read, which points to the issue that New Agers love...",The Enigma's Enigma

1121,"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 will provide hours of entertainment for the golf or video game golf fan. Let us face it, this is your only chance to play Pebble Beach and drive the ball over 350 yards. There are several different ways to play the game. My favorite is the Tiger Challenge which has an increasingly difficult series of golfers and tournaments to defeat. Along the way, you get awarded Trophy Balls for achievements like hitting a par4 green in one, making a hole in one, chipping in, and so on. You earn money with each victory and trophy ball which you use to upgrade your golfer's stats. Besides the Tiger Challenge, there are tournaments to enter, ""Speed Golf"", and some skill challenges to complete each of these games also let you earn money. I have the PS2 version of TW 2002 and will attempt to provide a comparison for those that have played the series before this year's version is an improvement in several ways. First the golfer's models are much improved and the pro golfers actually look sort of like the real people. The nonpro golfers are also well done and much more varied than last year. I have not counted, but I think there are about twice as many different golfers, and maybe twice as many golf courses. New this year is a stat that tells you what percentage of the game you have completed. At the beginning of the game, if the person playing is not very good, the computer controlled golfer he is playing seems to get worse and worse until he can be beaten. Through the game the computer golfers seem a little smarter and more skilled than in previous versions and the Tiger Challenge gets really tough about half way through. Unfortunately",This is your only chance to play Pebble Beach and drive the ball over 350 yards,very good overall with room for improvement
1122,"I read this book 20 years ago when it first came out.  I have been a Follet fan for years and eagerly await his new series coming out this summer.  This book was such a departure from his normal writing.  It was not what I was expecting.  The sequel is equally well written.  Follet brings his characters to life and you really care about them.  I loved the way he wove subplots throughout the book and you almost forget some of them until it comes back halfway through.  Over the last 20 years I have often thought of this book, and it is the best book I have ever read. I just watched the miniseries and now I will be rereading the book just to get clear in my head the differences from the movie and the book.  The sequel is set about a century later, but he picks up right where he left off and the two are almost seamless.  Quite a feat to me.  I do like historical fiction and thrillers.  Follet has done an amazing job combining my two favorite genres and even managed to get my interest in the romantic side.  Pillars of the Earth has it all.  It is a fictional story but written in such a way, I researched it to see what was fiction and what was real.  Follet manages to write it in such a way that it feels real.

1131,"I knew almost nothing about this movie before watching it, but I decided to give it a try since Denzel Washington is a firstrate actor who is work I have always enjoyed.  In this movie, once again, he delivers, and the other actors are good too.

The plot involves an evil spirit which moves from body to body, killing people along the way.  A police detective played by DW eventually figures out what is happening, and he comes up with a plan to kill the evil spirit itself.  You can watch the movie to see how it turns out ...

As far as deeper meaning, the main message I discerned is that maybe reality is stranger than we realize or can even imagine, and maybe that is why no one can explain why there is so much evil in the world.

But overall, this movie is meant to entertain rather than teach anything, and the entertainment is in the genre of what I would call 'scary suspense'.  Though I found this movie gripping, with plenty of unexpected twists, this is not a genre I care for, so my personal rating is only 3 stars.  But if you like this genre, you will probably like this movie too.",The best way to get a movie,Scary suspense

1139,"This is a great midi controller for the price.

Likes:
 Great integration with Ableton Live and other DAW software.  It automaps controls in a very nice way, and you can quickly switch between automapped surface control and midi cc modes, without touching your computer.
 Visual feedback.  Things light up and change color.  You can launch / stop / etc. clips in Ableton session view easily and it gives you visual feedback.
 Nice action.  Keys feel great for the price.
 Includes lots of knobs / sliders / pitch and mod wheels.
 Good performance.  Low latency on my macbook air.
 Includes virtual instrument plugins for bass station and v station, two really decent models of analog synths.

Dislikes:
 Kind Of wish it had standard MIDI serial in/out.

Other thoughts:
 On mac, w/ ableton, you can use AU plugins or VST.  The VST plugins crash ableton everytime you close them after use.  The AU plugins do not.  For me, it works much better when you do not enable VST plugins in the Ableton preferences, but only use the AU plugins.
 Does not ship with a CD, you have to download the plugins.  This is probably best, as you always get the most updated software.  For the MIDI side, it does not require a driver being a standard USB MIDI device, AFAICT.

Overall very, very happy with this controller for the price.",Great integration with Ableton Live and other DAW software,"Love it.  Great controls, integration, performance."
1140,"Three month update: 1 I am changing this rating of this from three to four stars after solving my biggest lingering issue; this was principally an eSATA hardware issue, not a Windows 7 issue, but which available support offerings did little to help resolve. 2 I finally isolated the recurring but intermittent shutdown, nonresponsive task manager and disappearing external hard drive issues that plagued this install of Windows 7. They were directly related to known issues with the eSATA interface of this Western Digital My Book Home 500 GB USB 2.0/FireWire 400/eSATA Desktop External Hard Drive WDH1CS5000N. Online research reveals an extended history of users experiencing a wide variety of performance issues with that hard drive's eSATA interface. In my case, when I switched from eSATA to USB 2, my Windows 7 immediately became stable and trouble free. My other experiences in the upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 lead me to recommend this: do not wade into this upgrade unless you have confidence in your operating system troubleshooting kung fu. You will probably need your best tricks should you have an obscure issue. But get through it...and Windows 7 is as good as any Windows operating system I have used going back to Windows 3.1. End of update. Original review content follows: ...just do not expect annoyancefree operation. It may be Windows 7, but it is first name remains ""Windows"". My experience: the benefits marginally outweigh the issues. But Windows 7 is not issuefree; do not consider unless you are a confident Windows troubleshooter. Technology pundits wrote at length about Windows 7 in assessing the prerelease offering. Opinions abound, offered by both sycophantic Windows 7 fanboys and the zealous Windows haters who seem to never tire of reminding Windows users that they are ohsocool with their overpriced Mac hardware",Windows 7 is not issue free; no issues if you are confident in your operating system troubleshooting,What Vista could have been; don't attempt upgrade without strong geek skills!

I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it is one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it has not.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.  I will continue to check the store to see if more comes in, but will keep in mind that I can order it on Amazon, although it will cost more.

The package had everything it said it should and nothing looked unusual until I got to the very last step building it and realized that the top of the grill was not correct and I had no way to install the thermometer or cook properly because the spot where it is supposed to be screwed in is a gaping 2 inch hole that the thermometer just falls through rather than the screw in hole shown in the last step.

Not sure if there is a special piece that should have been welded on or if someone just cut the hole about 2000 too big but it makes the entire grill unusable without something ghetto to plug the hole.

This is the perfect moisturizer for skin that is overworked in the summer. It is light and soothing and hydrates skin that is parched from sun exposure. This is not a heavy wrinkle cream, it is a lighter based moisturizer that soaks into your skin for soothing relief.

I am enjoying the mineral water products because it is so hot and dry here that the water is refreshing and it leaves skin soft and moisturized. Even the thermal spray is a nice relief in the summerit is cooling and very refreshing after a long, hot day, or in the middle of it.

I really like this line. I am very fond of the Neovadial  line by Vichy that includes a wonderful oil and a heavier moisturizer for wrinkles and skincare.

1199,"We use these frequently on bathroom remodels that had no previous vent. Fairly easy to install but I do not recommend DIY homeowners to make the roof penetration if they are not familiar with roof repairs. The metal cap should be installed so the side and top flange fits into the same overlapping pattern as the shingles around it. Do not just lay it on top of the shingles and goop up roofing tar. Best to hire a roofer for an hour to set the metal cap if you are not sure. It is cheaper than having to hire one to make a repair during the rainy season after finding a leak. This vent cap is best for wood shakes or asphalt composition shingles.

I thought the leather around the ankle was quite stiff when I tried them on but the style and color was so great, I kept them.  Very happy to report after wearing for about 1 hour, they feel likes boots I have worn for years.  Very comfortable, adequate cushion and support to wear for hours, solid walking surface in slush.  While they appear to be very well constructed and should last for many years with care, I do think the leather is a bit delicate so it will shows scuffs, scratches, etc., quickly but that will add to the vintage look.  I struggle to find boots that do not gape around my muscular but narrow calves and these are perfect over skinny jeans or thicker leggings.  If you have muscular calves, these will probably be too snug.  For reference, my calves are about 13.75 inches.  There is a bit of adjustment up on the top which will not take away for the great appearance.",Love these boots,Awesome boots!!
1218,"I first was very excited about this design, as I like the way the PS4 lights up on start up between the first and second Roman numeral. I then thought why did not the designers use the exact cover art of the game. I started to lose excitement in the design equating it with street paint for construction workers. As time went on though, the emblem on the front started to shine and I started to forget about the three Roman numeral design, as it became a background focal point. Yes, it could have been a better design, but it works. The four emblems on the front are really beautiful. As a sidenote, and not to start a console war, I prefer the look of the XBox1 design for Advanced Warfare and like the special sounds for start up. It would have been extra special if the designers had a special startup sound for the PS4, but it is what it is. If you are not sure of the design as I was, trust me it will grow on you. I AM GOING TO, this is definitely the best looking PS4 released to this date.",A very nice PS4,design for the console review
1219,"What is it? Somehow Bethesda combined the Simulation, FPS, and RPG genres with a dash of anxiety all into one package in Fallout 4. In the world of Fallout 4, a Nuclear war has left the inhabitants of Boston Massachusetts to fend for themselves without a central government. In this postapocalyptic part of the Commonwealth, you play the role of a widowed husband or wife, who is looking for their child Shaun after being frozen in a Vault for a couple hundred years. You Will be building, crafting, shooting and surviving. The Good and the Ugly. Giving EA a run for their money, Fallout 4 introduced an entire new mechanic to the Fallout series: Settlements; Id argue this game is ALL about Settlements. Think of it like a dumbed down Sims, but instead of using Simoleons to purchase buildings and furniture, you are gathering supplies all across the Commonwealth from the remnants of Boston like Hot Plates, Hacksaws, and more. Basically you are going to MacGyver the crap out of this. Each Settlement has several needs: Food, Water, Defense, and Beds; and they can populated by Settlers, and Companions companions accompany you ingame have side stories. Anyone who likes Simulation games will accidently carry themselves into the wee earlymorning building.and building until you run out of resources and are forced back into the wasteland to scavenge more. The Settlement system can feel pretty beta at times. Even with all the expansions added, furniture and structures are limited in number. Placement of objects can be odd as there is not always a snap system to have things completely symmetric like walls Gaps are never a good thing in any scenario. Its not always totally clear where an object goes after you choose to store it. Almost none of the placeable objects","All you need is a new mechanic, but this game works for the most part of our own Commonwealth",Fallout 4!  The Simulation Game?

1226,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",Works well,good kit with some caveats

I call the 800  and I am basically told that sometimes shipping shakes things up and I am being asked to disassemble parts to make sure it is ok.

Then I am told he will EMail me photos of what I have to do and he will call me back in ten minutes to see how things are.

1240,"Hit fastforward and spray gloss over everything  that is the main impression I have of this story.
I really wanted more backstory and more explanation for what was going on and some resolution would have been nice. What exactly did Garret do? When a hero goes bad  I really need to know how bad he went to decide if he is really forgivable or not. As it is, there is a lot of dancing around it, but nothing concrete. So while I am left imagining the worst, we have Garret and Ally going off on a trek through the woods and getting it on in the middle of nowhere no issues with wildlife, bugs, freeezing in the night, nope, then we have them running into problems and then ...we do not resolve the problems satisfactorily before poof, we are at the happy ending. I get the ""I do not want to write boring stuff. My characters are intelligent and they manage to figure out a way around things"", but if you explicitly said there was a problem that was not easily solvable, I would really like at least a oneliner explaining what happened. And the entire thing that prompted the quest? Not really explained at the end either.
In the end, this really did not do it for me. It was a fun romp in the woods, but I really like wellwritten plot and characterization along with my entertainment.

1241,"So far, the only complaint I have on this game would be the horrible camera angles, which I guess are supposed to be ""part"" of the cinematic experience. In short, a lot of camera angles will make your character walk like a drunk man.

Aside from that, I am enjoying how little things can make an impact on the game. Without putting in any spoilers, the choices you make as each person effect how others see them. Mike's girlfriend will see him as a brave hero or a cowardly child depending on a couple of choices. Each aspect of a character has several levels, as well as several levels of their relationship with each person.

I believe I am in Chapter 4 right now, and aside from having to stop to charge the controller, I am loving going back into the 80's horror genre, and cannot wait to see how the opposite choices will effect my next run. Completely love the game, well worth the wait!",Great story,the only complaint I have on this game would be the horrible camera angles
1242,"Based on a story by Philip K Dick, Blade Runner won acclaim for its gorgeous cinematography and its dark, film noir atmosphere.  It traces Harrison Ford as a cop that is on the trail of murdering humanlike robots. The robots are so close to human that they can try to pass themsleves off as human beings.
As in most of Philip K Dick's stories, the plot has many layers, twists and turns. The movie expands on the theme and draws you into this world where humanity is not always what it seems. Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer costar as two of the replicants, trying to stay ""alive"" in a world that does not accept them.
The original movie came out in 1982, and because the brass in the studio felt it was too complex for theatergoers, things like narrations and a happy ending were added to make it more marketable. In 1993, director Ridley Scott finally got to put out the version he wanted all along, with a more realistic approach. This definitely a movie that you will enjoy greatly, and be talking about for weeks afterwards. It is the forerunner for popular movies of today including the Matrix and Minority Report.

It was also rather expensive and sold only through pharmacies. In US it is available in most of the drug stores, but do not let that fool you. Although they are nor pricey and are not load with a lot of high end ingredients the Vichy products are very good.
This particular oil's first ingredient is mineral oil sounds scary? Baby oil is pure mineral oil and it does good job in removing make up too. Than some dissolvents, emollients and finally Camellia seed oil and vitamin E.

Performance:
it does remove make up well, but not 100 from eyes. I still use eye make up remover on reusable cotton pads. It did not dried my skin and makes pore look very small most oils do;jojoba, castor, maracuja etc.

I decided to go with this Sony SWFBR100/B Wireless Subwoofer as an adjunct to the excellent sound from the TV without all the connections wires and setup hassles. This subwoofer is designed for his model so set up was easy it was a matter of plugging the wireless connector and switching on the subwoofer and it works. I played around with the settings to get what level I was most comfortable with. I found that the best location for the subwoofer is behind viewer so you will be able to hear the sound separation between the TV speakers and the subwoofer.

1265,"This is an important film of Academy Award caliber. The characters are unforgettable and the story, with its haunting surreal quality, will linger long in my mind. I personally find Toni Morrison difficult and confusing to read. This was true of the book. Translated to film, however, the story works, and I found myself intrigued and interested in the tale set in 1873 of former slaves, making a new life for themselves and still living with the horror of the past. Hooray for Danny Glover. He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress. Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well known, she was always more Oprah to me than the character she was playing. The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I did not realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton. She is in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding. At almost three hours the video is too long. Some of the middle could have been honed down. Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton, have many scenes together. The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points. While played beautifully by the two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie",I personally find Toni Morrison difficult and confusing to read,A somber story of troubled people in a troubled time

1275,"I ordered this item as I purchased last year a Toshiba Satellite that included a DVD Movie factory by Ulead that works pretty well, very cool templates and other functionalities that have allowed me to create very goodlooking DVDs. There were some opportunity areas for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one. First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide. There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I have not tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it. The first one I would like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro",Very good DVD factory and really did it - but is still very useful,Finally an easy way to extract video from DVDs
1276,"But, you dilute it with a 20 parts water to 1 part Flow Aid, so it will last forever. I was never very good at math anyway. I keep the diluted flow aid in a water bottle that has red marker all over warning me not to drink it. Probably need a better way to store that, lol.

I used it with my Winsor Newton acrylics while I contemplated getting Golden Open acrylics.

It definitely increased the drying time and the paints were still wet to the touch on the palette the next day. The texture or porousness of the canvas determines the drying time on the panel, but I had to time to rework the paint. I still prefer the Golden Open paints yes I did break down and buy a set, but I can use up the Winsor paints now.

I have been keeping a small cup of the diluted Flow Aid on hand to use instead of water for thinning paints during the painting process. I will never use water to thin paints again. It. Is. Amazing. I still keep a cup of water for cleaning the brushes, but this is so much better for preserving pigment purity when thinning the wash.",Better for thinning paints,4 oz is a smaller bottle than I thought it would be

1279,"This is Terrence Malick's first film, and it shows. We see a few examples of beautiful photography, but they are incidental rather than central as in his other films. One Malick trope that I look forward to in each of his films is when he stops the action to focus on an animal the message being that around, beyond, and above our silly, pointless human striving, nature continues, oblivious. There is none of that here. Also, character development is not Malick's strong suit the characters in his films have already experienced their arc, and it is only a matter of gradually communicating this to us. In ""Badlands,"" this approach does not work we never understand why Kit suddenly decides to become a spree killer it just happens for no reason. Holly is also not credible as she has no more reaction to her father's murder and the random killings that follow, than if she were browsing booths at a yarn convention. We are supposed to accept that a perfectly ordinary garbageman and an even more ordinary high school girl could suddenly take off across the country, killing virtually everyone unlucky enough to meet them, just because Holly's father wants to end their relationship. Malick's succeeding films have been more visual and less talky. ""Badlands"" is further ruined by Sissy Spacek's incessant internal chatter, which ironically does nothing to illuminate the proceedings. There is a little bit of Malick's trademark ""who am I? Why am I here?"" when she wonders at one point in the journey where she would be at that moment if she had never met Kit, and what her future imaginary husband is doing at that same moment. Is he thinking about her, even though he has not met her yet? Other than those 30 seconds, her musings","This is Terrence Malick's first film, and it shows...",Elements of Malick
1280,"I decided to try this software because I could get it for free due to promotions and Norton wanted much more for the subscription.
Installation on Windows 2000 immediately presented a problem: the entire system hung after the installation. McAfee's support is useless, just their user's forum on their web site. Many users reported the same installation problem, but nobody has received any help from the company I stopped watching the forum after a few weeks. To compromise, I had to turn off one of the major services on Windows 2000. Unless the company fixes this problem soon, I am gong back to Norton.

1291,"Opoona, as far as RPG's are concerned, is a great mix of the traditional and the unique. You will do plenty of battling in random enemy encounters and boss battles, but you will do at least as much in terms of completing different jobs; many of which do not involve fighting at all. Battles themselves are unusual in that they are fought with spherical objects called ""bonbons"" that hover just above the characters' heads. Opoona, the chief character, has a single orange one. The bonbon is propelled at the target enemy by holding the analog stick in a certain direction before releasing it, and the speed or curve of the projectile can be altered depending on how long the stick is held. You can equip ""coats"" and other enhancements to each character's bonbon to alter them in various ways. Characters will also develop ""force"" techniques that work basically like a conventional RPG spell and require Force PointsFP to use. Many jobs will involve battling and are often the ones most necessary for progressing the game. As for jobs that do not require battling at least in the sense described above, Opoona can do everything from working in a fast food restaurant to divining fortunes. When the ""quota"" is met for a specific job Opoona can have the corresponding ""license"" upgraded to the next level. Not all jobs or licenses are required to progress further in the game, but I personally feel that most jobs are enjoyable to complete and offer a nice break from battling. Gameplay is varied, indoor locations are incredibly large and require much exploration, and play control is simple and can even be accomplished with use of the nunchuk alone though I prefer the combined use of nunchuk and Wiimote. Opoona's soundtrack is one of the best","Opoona has spherical objects called ""bonbonnen"" that hover just above the characters' heads",Bonbon's aren't Just for Eating

Anoushka is a fine improviser, and at around 17 years old, shows a world of promise. All of the music heard here was written by her father, mostly in the 1940's when he himself was just getting his own style in development. Anoushka does not play with fire on this disc, nor does it seem that she intends to. It is at least in my own opinion a way for her to show thanks to all of the people in her life, and to give a gift to the whole world, to prepare the world for the future. I believe that someday she  will get to writing her own music and she will be as equally phenomenal as her father. This is a good debut, a lovely, contemplative mood is captured in the music.

I ride hard, long, and at a high level. I buy A LOT of equipment. I put the Hillbilly Butt Pads to the ultimate test during a downhill skateboarding crash in the mountains... They literally saved my butt! My shorts were shredded in the rear but the butt pads performed flawlessly. The plastic tailbone protector stood up against cement well and did its job. I purchsed the Hillbilly Butt Pads and another more expensive brand that cost $75 on Amazon to test both. I selected both based on their top ratings and reviews. Upon inspection i found the more expensive brand did not offer as good padding, not as good coverage on the hips, thinner padding, was a less comfortable fit, and do not breathe as well. Pretty much all brands EXCEPT Hillbilly are designed the same. It is Hillbilly's different, better design that makes them the best choice. Here is what makes Hillbilly Butt Pads stand out against the other brands/designs: 1. Comfort. Others are not comfortable to wear and you know you have them on. You can almost forget you have Hillbilly's on due to their comfort. 2. Breathability. This is a major difference between hillbilly brand and others. They are the ONLY brand designed for breathability. It really pays off. 3. Better quality construction and durability all Hillbilly products are built better than competition by far. I wondered if there would be an issue due to the choice for more breathable construction but they were strong with no concerns and better construction than the competition. 4. Price cheaper than most comparable. 5. Padding is better","Best of Hillbilly's, better design",The best - get them!

I was able to watch movies and my husband listened to his iPod during all 4 of our flights and 10 hours of layover in addition to the occassional extra charge needed when we were away from our hotel for long periods of time. I also use this charger when I have been on my cell phone at my day job all day and do not have time to charge it. I plug my phone in while it is in my purse in my locker at my evening job. It turns itself off once my phone is charged, so there is no risk of damage to either device when left unattended. I am able to get my phone from no charge to full charge at least 45 times before I need to recharge the charger itself. This has come in extremely handy over and over. I keep it in my purse at all times and have even let others use it with the extra adapters it comes with. Everyone is been very impressed! It takes a little while to get your phone up to full charge, but it gets it up to adequate charge very quickly.

1333,"I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could have been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I cannot agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute  it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.

1348,"This was clearly a tough CD to make, and it had a number of things going against it: Townshend's hearing problems, Daltry's aging voice, Townshend's 2003 arrest, the death of John Entwistle. The 24 years since It is Hard in 1982 shows how difficult or unpleasant Townshend found creating new music for The Who. The struggle really shows on here. It is not the old ""on top of rock world"" Who. It is more like 2 old friends who have been at their craft for 40 years and seen comrades and friends die trying to do one more time as a coda to a brilliant career. The music is more acoustic and more ""demo like"" than previous Who albums and I get a sense this was because it was gentler on Townshend's ears that way.  Townshend is about as mentally sharp and creative as ever. ""Man In A Purple Dress"" is particularly effective as an angry attack on the hypocrisy of selfappointed holy men.

With temperatures hovering around zero, I found myself reaching for these time and again when I had to take the dog for a walk or shovel the walk again. I am buying another pair because I left the first one in northern Michigan when I was up there for a ski weekend.

Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry itself will let you keep a folder private  maybe not super securely, but how many people are going to have a hacker in their home trying to get at their files?  I was really wanting something that would let me share a folder on the network, but encrypt it and password protect it, so that I can access sensitive files on my desktop from my laptop  since I refuse to store sensitive information on a laptop that could be lost.  As far as I can tell, you cannot access a vault remotely once it is set up, which is fine if you only use one computer, but in today's world many people use more than one pc in their house.  This also requires you to move the files to the vault and you cannot pick the location of the vault as far as I could tell, which could cause problems for atuomated backups that are only looking in My Documents folder.  I suppose you could use this to protect the information on the laptop and store it there, but I just would not trust any software to keep my sensitive financial data safe if the laptop got lost or stolen.",bloated roundabout way of getting the job done,"It works okay, but"

1353,"This was an engrossing, gutwrenching tale of child disappearances,  capturing my attention from page one.

Naomi is known as ""the child finder."" She is young but already has found thirty lost children although not all of them were found alive.

She is been called in by the parents of a little five yearold girl that disappeared without a trace three years ago while looking for a Christmas tree with her parents in the Skookum National Forest in Oregon.

She has a special affinity to these cases because she was a lost child when she was young too.

I liked everything about this story. I loved Naomi's character  and I usually do not write this  I hope this becomes a series. And the story built very effectively towards a knockthemdead ending.

Mystery, psychological thriller, and a hard look at child abductions and abuse  I highly recommend it.

I received this book from Harper Collins through Edelweiss in exchange for my unbiased review.",The child finder,"""The most dangerous wilderness felt safer to Naomi than a room with a door that locked from the other side."""

1357,"First of all, this is MY opinion of this album. I will not ride the bandwagon just because she is new and different, she is new..but not that different. I have read many reviews, and it seems that if you do not like her, your opinions are worthless. Guess what. People do have different music tastes. Live with it.

I personally do not like this album that much, but she does have potential. Read her biography before you make statements about ""how she lived those words"". She grew up quite well.

It is no coincidence that Adele was THE artist of 2011, and that Del Rey seems to follow that mold. I always suspect artists that come out soon on the heels of a successful  artist, like Jessie J and Katy Perry.

Her lyrics are not that bad, but the production and sound seem rather sharp and irritating. The songs just do not seem to flow well, and it can be downright depressing. It will be interesting to hear her next album, since this is an Interscope rehash of some of her earlier stuff plus new. Her Billboard results in sales show somebody likes her, so she is getting the exposure.

But being popular does not mean you are great. I give it 3 stars because there is a great potential here, but would like to hear more of her then what she is showing on this album.

Again my opinion, opinions are not facts. You may disagree, that is fine. That is your opinion.",Does not like a good album.,Lots of haters out there..lackluster perfomance

1365,"01/03/18 UPDATE: So, after 3 months of use, I decided I just cannot get accustomed to the move of the colon/semicolon, question/backslash keys. The number keys are also smaller. Going back to my other keyboard.

Just got this and am getting used to it. I like the keyboard response, although I do find the space bar is a bit smaller than my last one, so am making adjustments. When using the stand I find it is a little too close to the keys on the keyboard, but I see this as merely getting accustomed to this new piece of equipment. I found it odd that I had to logon on to the Alpatronix website using Chrome rather than Safari  I could not register this device using Safari as it only showed a blank screen except for the notice, ""If you have already registered....etc.""

Measurements: band 29, breasts 34.25. I used to be a 34DD. I could now fit another person between the band gap and me. I obviously needed to go down a size. I had a new QuadBoob in my trustworthy fav styles. Time for a change. I have been become besties with Amazon, Advice Sites, Fitting Sites, and my UPS carrier. I know my correct size, what works and what does not now. The trouble is FINDING it. The stores here do not have professional fitters nor carry my size. I am ready to start a new trend of letting the girls be freeee! I am finding out I am not alone. I blogged about this and many are in the same boat!!! Why will not any make bras that actually fit? The Cleo came highly recommended via many blogs. WELLLL, the 30DDD was huge in the cups: tons of extra material and gaping. The 30DDD in the Cleos are tinnny and armpit boob gore does not lie flat????!!! The gore did lay flat in the 30DDD but a ton of extra material, so much gaping and the same armpit boob.

1372,"Metallica. Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind. One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money. Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs. The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best. Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end. This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos. After the Black album pay no attention to them, you will only be disappointed, but back to this album. Kill `them All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash great songs but not important lyrically speaking. Almost all of these songs are about Death. Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say. With a short break down I will show what I mean. 1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion. This one is about Nuclear Warfare 2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you will be happy to have stuck in your head. This one is about the Electric Chair. 3. For Whom the Bell",Not Metala,Are you ready to Ride the Lightning?

Almost two hours later, unable to turn it off at any point, I am compelled to sit at the keys for a quick review... I have never bought into the label of Greatest British Female Vocalist as applied to Dusty. To me, quite clearly and beyond argument, she was and remains the Greatest Female Vocalist of All Time, period, and this superbly crafted DVD I think frames that conclusion in gold and hangs it so high on the wall that it cannot be reached. This is Dusty naked no interviews interrupting old clips, no guest stars, no bogus sets, and every note is sung and played live. Just Dusty, three backup singers and a great orchestra offstage, and crazy, very receptive audiences. Dusty is in great spirits, she is funny, clever, very playful, chatty and Dear God could this woman sing. From that breathy intimate voice that sounds like it is coming from the pillow next to you... to that rockin', belting, jazz drenched powerhouse voice that knocks every ball out of the park be it Motown or supper club standards... this girl could seemingly do anything. Only the extras are in color the central body of the disc is in glorious, crystal clear and razor sharp black and white, and she is never looked better. That hair, those eyes, that smile... she is simply stunning. Still photos never did her justice Dusty was a beautiful woman. Great camerawork thoughout, with tons of lingering closeups and a genuine understanding of what the slower songs are all about. This leaves all the other Dusty DVD's far behind.

Well, I installed Office 2008 on my new Mac today and so far everything has gone smoothly. Installation was quick and easy, though I think after installation the software required about 4 major updates which made it all take a while longer. I am using Office 2007 on Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, as well, and I have also used it on a Vista machine. I like the way the new Mac version has kept nice, compact default views on all the major app pages. You can bring up all the nice tools and gadgets quickly and easily by just clicking on buttons for Gallery, Toolbox, Navigation, and so on. Those various toolbars fade in very quickly up top, giving you very easy access to templates and such without stealing too much additional screen real estate. A lot of people gripe about Windows functionality. I do not really need highpowered usage on any of the apps. I am setting up Word documents without too much formatting, PowerPoint decks using only minor tweaks of existing templates, and, well, come to think of it, I really do not ever deal with any huge spreadsheets in Excel. For average, everyday use, I think it is pretty adequate. Also, I never loved Apple Mail. I just do not think it has enough timemanagement features. I am glad to have more ability to set up appointments, link to actions and contacts, and track todo's through Entourage.

1420,"When 'American Beauty' was released it brought fresh life into Hollywood cinema coupled with 'Fight Club' that same year, we were especially lucky. Directed by English theatredirector Sam Mendes and written with intense sensitivity by Alan Ball it is one of the great movies of the century. The story of a disfunctional family, each separated by their own wishes for fulfilment and by the people around them may sound dull but 'American Beauty' breathes a different kind of life into it. It centres around the dry Lester Burnham Spacey, who narrates the story from beyond the grave. Stuck in a dead marriage to wife Caroline Bening and a boring job he witnesses an epiphany in the shape of Angela, the best friend of his daughter Jane. Thinking his years after high school to be a waste he starts getting himself in shape, smoking pot and even pursuing Angela. The amazing thing about this movie is that it does not merely focus on Spacey but on all the people around him, each with their own dreams, hopes and failures which Mendes treats with a care and sensitivity unusual to most films. For instance, Caroline may be pushy but she is cracking up inside, Jane has concerns about her body and even Angela is worried that she might not be perfect after all. Another interesting thing is that Spacey is not the hero as you would expect him to be. Sure we admire him, the guy that decides to take his life by the reigns, but we admire neighbour and Jane's boyfriend Ricky Bentley even more. This is because despite being trapped at home with an abusive father and a mother who is intriguingly unhinged he still feels gratitude for all the beauty that the world has to offer.

1445,"The way this was mailed to me, folded up like it had been swiped from a pallet that had a heavy load sitting on top of it, it kind of ruined the mask. I could not seem to get it into the right shape. I thought it was misleading how in the picture advertised you cannot see the eye holes. IN reality you could, and it was very obvious. Dobby does not have eyeballs on his cheeks.
It was also very poorly made, with some leftover melted plastic at the chin part.

I give it 3 stars because of all the laughs it gave my family.

We put a meatball in the nose of the mask and then put it on my sister's herding dog. His name is Toby, but we kept saying in a Dobby voice: ""Tobby is a bad dog. Tobby will not eat Master's meatballs!"" like Toby was Tobby.

When I wore it for Halloween, my son was Harry Potter, so I had to do what he told me, so something to think about if you are getting this with plans of being near a friend or child that is dressed as Mistah Pottah.",I'm afraid it was wrong,"Dog Approved, Lots of Laughs"
1446,"This is one of the best anti virus programs out there. It is much better than most of it is competitors. It detects many more viruses and almost over protects you, which for the average user is a good thing.

It seems to come up with less false positives than others, which is a result of an active team of researchers and responders. A lot of the free virus checkers are set to be overly suspicious and tend to block or warn you of too many legitimate programs or applications, which tends to get annoying fast, and probably a lot of people turn them off because of that. Kaspersky takes this into consideration and has a good list of 'approved' programs and apps, so setting it to the automatic level will protect you and not annoy you.

I myself like the version that includes a firewall and more security features, but for just virus protection this is a fine choice for your pc.",Good antivirus program,One of the best

1448,"A young girl, for her 5th birthday, is to have her very first camping trip. Abby is really excited and looking forward to this special event. When the day arrives and it is time to go camping a sudden clap of thunder sounds and it begins to pour rain. The trip is cancelled and Abby becomes disappointed. Find out how she deals with her feelings to overcome sadness and anger.
  The artwork is pleasing and perfectly conveys the main points of the storyline.
  This book and many other books by this author allows parents to assist their child with issues of disappointment all the while strengthening the bond between parent and child, which may further help children to talk to their parents about their feelings; something sometimes hard to do. Sharing emotions and learning what to do when you fell that way is something this author has mastered so very well. Look for other books by Chaim Gold dealing with concern, worry, curiosity, annoyance, anger, panic, longing, discovering the future, gratitude, contentment, shame, confusion, and revenge, among other helpful emotion coping skills and knowledge.",Great book,Terrific Book - Really Helpful With Emotions And Opening Up Discussion Between Parent/Child

1450,"Highly Recommended I was skeptical at first to buy Forza 6. At the time when purchasing, I also noticed the new Need for Speed was being released and I only wanted to purchase one at the time. After seeing Forza 6 receiving VERY high praise on the Xbox live reviews, IGN, Amazon, and GameStop while Need for Speed received around a 6.0, it was very obvious which one to choose. Forza is the most realistic car racing game to date! It has absolutely amazing graphics, customizability, and sound. While most other racing games right now are the old Arcade style, Forza 6 goes as in depth into tuning and control that any avid gaming could hope for in 2015. REASONS TO BUY: Environmental impacts: This game utilizes everything from rain, darkness, puddles, sand, grass, etc. to give you a very realistic experience of real life scenarios. Tuning: Each vehicle is completely unique, feels unique, and must be tuned accordingly if you ever plan to win any multiplayer races. Tuning is EXTREMELY indepth and can take a very long time to master for each specific vehicle and track. If you do not like tuning, no problem! You can download leading players tunes that will apply to your car to help you out. however it is still best to learn your own and apply it to your own driving style Customizability: You can deck out your car any way you wantadd any graphic you wantrimsbody kitsNot only that, the changes to your car still impact performance rather than being solely visual. Longevity and skill: With the price being around $60, I wanted a game I can play for a Long time and that requires skill to win and not just time. This game is the pentacle when it comes to that!

1452,"Own 5 pairs of these. Use them in everything  office work, airplane travel, etc. yes people make fun of me, but the degree of silence makes me happy. Those same people can enjoy wasting the rest of their lives watching tv, gossiping, and having accomplished nothing.

I probably have hyper active hearing, but these decrease volume to a level I imagine most people experience in their everyday lives. Without them noises are harsh and obscene. I Am the kind of person that cannot go to a movie theater or concert without ear plugs  can hear capacitors, tv circuits, light bulbs, and other strange things.

I can still easily hear conversation with ear soft ear nrr 33 ear plugs and these ontop. I think it is more a result of vibrations and less of actual ear drum activity.

This is by far the best noise cancelation headphone I have found yet. 3m sells one better: pelter bullseye 3  which I am looking for.

I wish they made an 80db headphone. I feel like 60db reduction is necessary to actually block everyday noise.

1467,"This mounting kit fit my RPS Hawk 250 near perfectly. Clutch side required no modification, but brake side required me to move the brake reservoir further from the starter/kill switch. Since the little plastic bushings make the hand guards super adaptable, it fit near perfect with no major fitment issues. The only issue is the support arm holds the hand guard a little close on the brake side side effect of being on the other side of the brake reservoir. The support arms, and mounting hardware feel very solid. Pics to come soon. Only major problem? I dropped one of the Allen bolts, and there was no spare with my kit. I sent an email to the manufacturer, so I hope to hear back on replacement cost, or replacement size. That is my fault though. I am the one who dropped it.

1468,"SkinMedica is a line of medicated skin care products that previously could only be purchased with a prescription from a plastic surgeon or medical spa. This product, the HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator, is designed to moisturize, and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles. It has an interesting texture, as it is a really light serum but still feels like a gel, but it provides so much hydration that your skin feels like you have applied a heavy, silky cream. There is a faint, medicinal, clean scent to it. It arrives protected and presented in a heavy displaytype box, and a large, sleek silver dispenser that is a bit deceiving, considering there is only 2oz of product within. The Amazon description recommends to wet your fingers before applying to face and neck though that is not mentioned on the box or product twice daily, both in the AM and PM. Application is smooth and not greasy, and only a little bit is needed. I have been using it for about a week, and it does give your skin a beautiful glow, and seems to plump up skin so wrinkles disappear.

1490,"This is just a simple overview of how the game looks and feels, because I am no where near beating this game assuming you can actually beat SSX ON TOUR. When you see the advertisements for this video game your probably thing the cartoonish art is just for advertisement purposes. But the moment you pop the game into your PSII you discover the ugly truth which will haunt you for the rest your days so long as you continue to play SSXSurpriseT. The horrible cartoonish art I have not seen since I have looked at the edges of my brother's notebooks plagues the game. Scribbles and poorly drawn characters are what greet you when this game begins. There are three modes within the game itself: 1: The Tour The supposed story mode of the game. 2: Quick Game A free ride around the snowy mountain side, wherever they may be. 3: EXTRAS Cheat codes, credits, and other things that are not directly tied into the game until after you beat it. ""THE TOUR"" Begins you on an airless storyline of bringing a snowboarder or ""Skier"" A new feature in the SSX series to stardom if you complete all the challenges and ON TOUR Modes. Along the way you will be challenged by the original SSX characters Physmon Nate Kaori Elise Riggs Mac, etc, who had have also taken a step down in the looks department as opposed to their design in SSX3. None of them really look like their former selves though I know this is what happens you use better graphics but this time its just plain insulting: Kaori looks nothing like a Japanese female she also lost the quirky voiceover that spewed Japanese at you as you raced and appears as though she got a plastic surgery job",The SSX series with the original looks department,"What in the name happened with SSX on Tour, EA?"

I love to mix it up, love to experiment with color, to do something different every day neutral today, smokey the next, pop of color the day after that.

All of these colors are frosts, so have some glitter to them. And NONE of them have the pigment on your eyes or at least mine that they did in the palette. Especially the Time to unwine one, which was supposed to be an eyeliner color. I was really disappointed in that the pink color only had a hint of pink, compared to the beige one.

1516,"I used this as my sole source of battery charging for several weeks. It has some serious flaws, but the thing that I can not forgive is how harsh on the USB port the device is. I feel like it is wiggling my Xbox's USB port everytime I have to remove it, which is ALWAYS a bad thing for ports.
I ultimately decided to return my Nyko Modular Power Station, as it just was not what I was hoping. Below are some pros and cons, but I would highly recommend just getting yourself some high quality rechargeable AAs. I have been using Eneloops and am getting about 4 times the gametime on a single charge of two AAs.

Pros:
Design: if you like the wider look, it is cool
Does not require controllers to charge

Cons:

Design: the added width makes it hard to find a place to fit your xbox
Durability: This was the biggest problem to me. I felt like it was wiggling the USB on the side of my Xbox which could eventually leave to connectivity issues on that port. I think this device was just far too harsh on that port.

1533,"REVENGE by Yoko Ogawa, review by Sergiu Pobereznic author
This author was new to me, but certainly a pleasant surprise. The book was a quick read and held me captive  the majority of the time.
It is a collection of eleven stories. The tales are dressed in a Gothic atmosphere and are faintly linked by recurring imagery and themes, some rather peculiar characters, and even more peculiar deaths.
Although some of the links were quite obvious, I did not feel that they were always necessary. The stories do stand alone the good ones do, at least. There were a couple that were dubious, but it did not completely ruin my reading experience. The links can be seen as clever, but for me, personally, a few of them felt slightly forced and unnatural.
Reading this work I was reminded of Poe, which is meant as praise. The prose was uncomplicated, beautiful and terse. There was some humor that came as a welcome break. But on the whole the pages were tinged with the overriding theme of loneliness.
I have no other experience regarding the author's other works, but I will definitely be looking into her literature.
The title REVENGE baffled me, because I could find no logical association to the stories themselves. I later found out that the original Japanese title is translated to mean A Quiet Corpse. This would have worked far better regarding the thematic concept of these dark and mysterious little tales.

1541,"Edward G. Robinson was a very good actor, that went unnoticed by me until I viewed this movie. His sense of timing and degree of becoming the character, is a work of dedication and method. More than a mere studio extra, he went the extra mile to insinuate emotion and feeling into the part he plays, and convinces the audience that he is the bumbling, backwards, introverted, and shy clerk, but also, the ruthless gangster who is his exact double. The fact that the film  is a comedy, makes it that much more remarkable.",Amazing actor,"Robinson was a very good actor, that went unnoticed by me until I ..."
1542,"Big fan of John Carpenter films such as Escape From York, Halloween, The Thing, Assault On Precinct 13  Black Moon Rising.
But the one thing I really liked about John's films were he knew how to make the soundtrack sound and did not do what most director did getting symphony's or crappy songs. John's score was always dark, loud and gave the film it is feel and setting to it. I always thought John could make his own albums as his soundtracks we are so good and what do you know he did.
I really enjoyed listening to this album as it reminds me a lot of his films and the glory of the awesome 80s.",John Carpenter was one of my favorite films,Lost Themes Takes Me Back To The 80s

It was a bit small for my Great dismay7 at first, but after a bit of squeezing, it is adjusted and molded to the keyboard quite nicely. Pockets are incredibly handy and the dust cover is a nice touch.

My only problem is the backstraps. Attaching these via Velcro is literally stupid. I am carrying a 25 pound keyboard on my back and for whatever reason they think the velcro straps can support that kind of weight. Do not use the backstraps your keyboard will undo the velcro and crash onto the floor and you will be very sad.

1550,"I have been listening to this album for 3 weeks, and it has totally become a staple in my music diet. This album may have been a little annoying at first, but now I truly feel what he feels. Sure, the songs are longer. But I find most of them to still be entertaining all the way through. The only track I really have any problem with is the first one, with the children talking at the beginning, and after that, especially at around 5 minutes, Kodesh takes off into Got No Water, a song I had never heard before I do not own Shake Off the Dust...Arise. I will give an indepth analysis of the album below: Kodesh: Like I said, slow start, but great ending, Got No Water is amazing. Time of Your Song: Great song, more rock version of it. I liked it, but I still think I like the original better. Mist Rising: One of my favorites. Has a great beat and also has that cool robotic music at the end, very transformative. Darkness Into Light: Crickety cool music and a great falsetto followed by a very passionate and energetic rendition of one of my favorite songs on Light. Youth: Probably my favorite track on the CD, mostly because after Youth, he breaks into Aish Tamid and does the second half of that song as rap, and it has an amazing beat. I Will Be Light: Great song, better on this album than on Light, has some great moments where he is just wailing or whatever it is he does. Two Child One Drop: Amazing song with some guy doing some Jewish noises in between verses. Very entertaining song with amazing lyrics and music. He even goes into other songs, such as Dispatch the Troops, and",Amazing.,"Great Ablum, As Good if Not Better Than the First"

1575,"Informative and enlightening! This book was very interesting to say the least. The topic of using crystals to empower and heal you is not something you hear everyday. I figured it is worth a read and overall, I am glad I did. I am not totally sold on all the ""healing"" promises of crystal use, but I can see how there is more than meets the eye with many things in life, and crystals may be one of those things. At the end of the day I think it comes down to your mindset and that is what affects your success and health... so if crystals can physically help you relax and contribute to a better mindset, then it works! It come down to belief, and if you really believe that these things work then they will! Why not use something solid like a crystal to focus your intention on, and they are pretty too! I think every person's situation is different, so read this book and decide for yourself if you want to get into it some more.

1579,"It takes 4 aa batteries, this makes it kind of heavy. It is heavy enough that it would be annoying to walk around all day with it around my neck. It is bigger than I was expecting. I though it would fit in my pocket but it is too wide for that to be comfortable. I have not used it too long but one time I clicked the button that turns it on and the button almost fell inside so make sure to press the button lightly. It was popped and moved to the side so it would not pop back out, but I pressed it again and moved it center and it worked fine.

As for how much air it blows that is pretty good on the medium and fast speeds. The only problem with that is on the fastest speed its very loud. For example if some had this on in an office cubicle it would annoy their neighbor cubicle, as if they were running a big fan.

So to sum it up it all depends on what you are using it for and how long you are using it. I like the fact that it bends up or down, has a string, is powerful if need be and it was a low price to get it.",Good for the price,Works well but it's much bigger and louder than I was expecting
1580,"I have dry skin so in recent years I have come to really love cream blushes and have a few different shades from a variety of brands MAC, Too Faced, etc.. This is the first cream blush I have tried from Jane Iredale and I am a fan. One of the main differences between this cream blush and the others I own is that it comes in a bullet rather than a compact/pan. I love this because it makes it easier to apply. I just swipe it on my cheeks with medium pressure and follow up with a beauty blender to blend it in and give a more natural look. It makes it a tad more simple to apply than in a pan where I would use my fingers or a cream blush brush. I also quite like the color. I have lightmedium skin that is neutral in tone and I found this neutral mauve to be very flattering on me. It is a very good neutral shade that goes with a variety of lip colors and I especially like how it looks when I am going for more natural look. But it also works really well when I want a statement eye or a bold lip to be the focus of my makeup and for my blush to be more neutral/understated accordingly. I also think it wears quite well on my skin. I can definitely get a full workday of wear out of it and do not have problems with it transferring to other surfaces. The only thing that did not quite make sense to me is the concept of this being cream to powder. To me even after applying it still looked like a cream blush to me and no different than the other cream blushes I have","My favorite cream blushes are MAC, Too Faced",Very wearable and flattering
1581,"This works well as a makeup remover for sensitive skin. It is really light and gentle.
If you are skin is not sensitive though, I would recommend sticking to your regular makeup remover as it does a much better job at removing makeup.

1586,"The dispenser is basically a plastic disc, a little over 3 inches in diameter and about an inch high, with the tape sticking out of the top. On the bottom is a rubber circle only attached to the plastic base in the very center. The bottom half is white and the top comes in a variety of colors I received a green one. The rubber disc acts like a suction cup, keeping the dispenser from being able to be lifted straight up but still allows it to slide along the surface. Though there are divots in the side of the plastic disc where you can lift an edge of the rubber circle to break the suction like seal and allow it to be lifted. You do not need to put pressure down on it to make it suction either, just tossing it at a surface works fine assuming it lands with the rubber disc down. However, it does not really work trying to hang it upside down it sticks for a few seconds and then drops or horizontally against a wall slides to the bottom of the wall. Loading/refilling the tape is a breeze, as there is a section that slides open allowing for loading of a tape pad. The tape sections are precut into 75 strips, so you do not have to worry about cutting off the tape. Alternately, you cannot have longer pieces should you need them; however each strip is about 2 inches which covered all the tasks I typically use tape for. Refill packs were not terribly expensive when I saw them in the store, but you are probably stuck using Scotch brand refill packs.

We popped a batch of Amish baby white in our WhirlyPop using coconut oil and popcorn salt the famous yellow kind, name slips my mind, then melted a scant two tablespoons of this concentrated butter to pour over the top. There was no artificial oiliness or orange dye, just a very nice, natural buttery feel and taste.

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

1622,"I got this set of strings for Christmas, both these green ones and an orange set. On the back of the box it says something like

""The main reasons players tell us they prefer DR strings are: Easy bending and feel great, brighter edge to sound, and noticeably longer life"".

 They are probably the easiest bending strings I have used yet, I will give them that. They did not really sound brighter... noticeably longer life? More like noticeably shorter life. The strings were dead within two weeks. The B string broke and most of the strings coating wore off, and they sounded horrible. I bought two sets, and when I put the second set on, it only lasted one week! The B string again broke, and they were ridiculously hard to tune. By the way, I only practice for about an hour a day...

1633,"I was a bit worried about buying shoes on line for my ultra picky daughter.  She is SO sensitive about how things fit and feel.  Shoe shopping with her takes hours and often times we have gone home after a day of shoe hunting without anything because she cannot find one pair that she liked.  When she first put these on, she said they were to tight, but after wearing them in the house for half an hour, she said they felt fine.  I was concerned that she was only saying that but would not actually wear them because they were not comfortable for her, but she wears them every day to do her chores on the farm, and also wears them out on long walks.  Today she played airsoft at a friend's property for four hours wearing these and had no problems.  She says they are the most comfortable rain boot/muck boot she is ever worn, and they are cute so they can be worn out as well.

1636,"This is a highend luxury brush that truly delivers. There are two things you need to know when you are ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: fullsize the largest size, handy medium sized, or pocket the smallest size. This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept say, in your handbag, but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you would do better with a larger size. The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want all nylon, like this Detangler? Even though the Detangler is all nylon, some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter, just like the mixed bristle brush. It is hard to see in the picture. You should know that the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a bristle brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush. The Detangler is a brush just like the other brushes, not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing. It is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also. Even though my hair is very short, it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick. This handy size is about eight inches long. It is quite a large expense to buy any Mason Pearson product compared",The perfect brush for a larger size,Beautiful Brush Worth the Money

1640,"When Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario 64, they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo 64. It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.
With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug OF War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.
It is a shame that most games did not seem to be like Mario Party. Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version, the original is always the best one to try for starters. If you really want it, then roll the dice and take that very first chance.","The original is always the best, yet it's a good game!",Roll Of The Dice

1646,"This is a great little pump. So small 6"" it will fit in a medium saddle/wedge bag. Very light. But, very well made. One of those rare products that you feel someone designed to use it themselves. Aluminum, not plastic. Lifetime warranty and its inner parts are repairable. The air volume produced by each stroke is increased about 30 more than the competition by making the inner sliding handle hollow and part of the compression chamber. It comes with a nice mounting bracket to share the mounting holes on your bike with a water cage. But, for me, it is going in a saddle bag. For an urban/hybrid/touring/road bike, this is a good pump. For a mountain bike, you probably want a larger pump because your tires require more volume. For a road bike, you might want a larger pump because you require higher pressure. But, for people who need 6080 lbs, and their tires are about 26"" x 38 to 700 x 35, this pump works. Remember, you do not need ideal pressure just to get home or a gas station. 2/3 pressure should be ok if you ride softly. Flat repair on the road should be considered as layers. I carry a spare tube because I do not want to spend time patching. But, I carry selfadhesive patches just in case something goes wrong replacing the tube. Similarly, I like the spacesavings properties of CO2 inflators. But, that is are oneshot deal. Having a small pump allows you to air up the tube to locate and patch a leak without wasting precious CO2. And, if something goes catastrophically wrong with the CO2, you still have the option of pumping for 15 minutes. Better than walking for 23 hours.. I think some negative reviewers want this pump to function","Very light. But, very well made",Great as a backup to CO2 inflator

1665,"The color is a unique neutral shade that seems a blend of gray, brown and lavender which result in a color that most closely resembles, but is not exactly, taupe. It looks good whether on toe and/and fingernails and is a nice subtle change from colors I usually select.

The polish is thin and smoothed out easily, drying within a couple of minutes. I applied two coats, and for longevity, used an inexpensive S. Hanson base and top coat. After almost a week, the polish is wearing well with a reapplication of the top coat a couple of times during that time period.

The bottle is distinctively shaped but because it is easy to tip over, is somewhat impractical. Containing only .27 of an ounce when many other brands contain .50, the result is less product for a cost higher than many other polishes. It is hard to judge, but I am not seeing a clear distinction in quality to justify these differences. But, with makeup items the decision often rests in personal preference not an in depth analysis.

But on Chrsitmas Eve, because of intense frustration and an impending scandal he conemplates suicide. He is visited by an angel named Clarence a lovely performance by Henry Travers who shows him what the world will be like if he had never been born. It is at this point that the film becomes very dark especially given what has gone before, yet the underlying message is simple and uplifting ""no one is a failure who has friends"". George Bailey was a completely selfless man, who thought himself a failure, and yet did not realise he was so loved by his friends and neighbours.

1693,"A copy of this title was received in echange for an honest review.

The first installment 1 of 4 in the Condemned Angels MC series introduces Roxy and Chase.  Roxy is the daughter of the President of the CA MC and Chase is a member of the Hell's Rebels MC soon to become VP.  They are forbidden by club law to be involved.  But MC laws have nothing on the laws of the heart.  Roxy is a little spitfire and not afraid of living her life.  Chase is your typical alpha MC member.  The give and take between these two is HOT.  Lots of confusion, angst, passion, love and hate.  The characters are well developed and easy to like except Jake, nobody likes him.  Jake is the Treasurer of the CA MC.  When Roxy returns from college they end up as a couple.  You can imagine what that does to Chase.  The fallout that happens between these three is intense.

The story time lapses over several years and the author makes it an easy read.  Love, hate, passion and MC dynamics are all involved.  The only issue I had with this book was that I did not feel ""connected"" to the MC.  The story focuses more on the relationship between Roxy and Chase  but very little is mentioned about the MC or club business in detail.  This by no means detracts from the interactions between Roxy and Chase and Jake.  But it would have been nice to have a little more insight into club business and how that impacts the characters.

This story is definitely NOT a stand alone as it ends a cliffhanger.  But thankfully, the second installment is already out.  So oneclick both of these to get you started on the Condemned Angels story.",Great book.,More of a love story than a MC love story

Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It does not have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it is a good lowfrills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

1717,Just read some of the other reviews of Neil Diamond's DVD. There seems to be some confusion if it is in Dolby 5.1. It is in 5.1. The problem is it defaults to PCM. So go to the main menu and select the audio button and you  will see the 5.1. I also recommend increasing the center channel volume  about 4db. This is a must for Neil Diamond fans. Sound and video are well  done.,I've never heard of Neil Diamond,"Hey everyone, it is in Dolby 5.1"
1718,"Cheap and Sturdy enough, but major flaws. Stabilizing bar for the upper stand is too short to be used when the lower stand is extended to it is lowest position. At its lowest position, in which all the parts fit together as intended, there is still no adjustment for the height of the upper stand, so you are stuck with a fixed distance between the two keyboards, which in my opinion is too much it is about a foot. That makes the top board in its lowest position about 4 feet off the ground. Too tall for a short person to play at a comfortable arm position. So the upper stand is useless to me. I will be using the lower part of the stand for my practice keyboard at home, but no way this is going to work for me in a tandem board gig situation.

1721,"man, this is a great machine. I had been wanting one for years, finally I got enough gift certificates together from work we have an award system that it only ended up costing me 40 bucks. But, that aside, I really do love this saw, recently I had to adjust an angle by 1/4 degree to get it square to a matching piece. It was so easy to do. Then just a handle flip, and it is back to original square. I checked everything out when I got it, even went to Lowes to buy the 200 dollar stand, which I really recommend. The saw came just a tad out of square, but undoing 3 screws, it was so easy to put right. I have it set up so I can go from the table saw to the miter saw, and do not need to reset anything like I used to on the table saw. I love it.

1726,"There are may other players out there in the lower cost PDF solution,  Nitro and Nuance are two of the bigger ones.  Adobe Acrobat is too expensive but most users do not require Acrobat.  Many people could also get by with free solutions.  However,I like to have a little more power. so I can batch process and form design. Corel PDF did allow the form design and putting files to together for one PDF file,

Corel did design a nice UI but having nice UI does not always translate into an easy to use product.  If you are Adobe Acrobat user there is a learning curve with the interface.  Getting multiple file types to work as one has been a challenge and had resulted in multiple crashes.  Reaching out to Corel support proves nothing more than frustrating.  When you finally get a hold os some they have to go through the basic troubleshooting, which you most likely have done.

One nice feature is the plugin for Word allows you to edit Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberryS files within Word.  Microsoft provided the ability to save as Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberryS in Word 2010 but not edit.

1729,"It is a good thing Amazon has different ratings for ""overall"" and ""fun"" this is the first time I have needed them to be distinctly different. Assassin's Creed is a brilliantly realized game that brings the time period to life in ways I would have never imagined possible prior to playing the game. That being said, it felt like more time was spent on the engine and the detail than the gameplay itself. From an artistic perspective it is a wonderful game, but as entertainment value... I struggled with liking it. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the miscellaneous tasks get quite repetitive and towards the end of the game I began skipping saving citizens and other things I did not need to do. I do not think it would have been as bad if they did not have some tedious controls associated with them. After you save a citizen and lock onto them to talk to them and receive credit your camera locks in and you are unable to walk away and get off to the next task. You are stuck waiting the 35 seconds for them to spout the same line the last saved citizen did. The same thing happens with any task you turn in, and it begins to wear thin. In the first few hours of the game I was mesmerized by the size, the scope, the beauty. The first time I sat atop a tower and the camera panned out to show the lay of the land I was hooked but it soon faded as you are asked to do it again, and again, and again. It is a neat mechanic, but not when everything about the game begins to get repetitive, including the assassinations themselves.

Using the stylus and touch screen to prepare your various dishes for dining pleasure, Cooking Mama will look adorable even to the most jaded of gamers thanks to it is cartoony yet unbelievably charming presentation.  There is a nice amount of different combination dishes to cook up, but sadly it will not take you long to march through the game at all.  This is simplified even more thanks to the fact that Cooking Mama is about as far as can be from offering any sort of real difficulty whatsoever.  Despite all that though, Cooking Mama has a great deal of charm to it that will put a smile on your face no matter what; which in itself is a welcome feature in any game.  It is not very deep, if at all, and offers little in terms of replay value, but Cooking Mama is a worthwhile, and affordable, distraction while it lasts.

1750,"This bag is great if you do not want a tail bag, but it is not for everyone or every bike. I have been riding my Yamaha FZ07 to work lately, and I have had to take more items with me than I do when I just go for a ride. Things like another helmet visor to swap out for daytime vs. nighttime rides I know I could wear sunglasses, but I prefer not to, steel toe work shoes I am required to wear my boots when I ride to work, my usual tools and equipment, and, if I have storage space, food for lunch. I now own this tank bag, tail bag, and saddle bags from NelsonRigg. All are great bags, but for me, the saddle bags are my preferred method of on board bike storage. Trouble is, I cannot quite fit everything I need in them for commuting to work. I can barely squish everything into the tail bag, but then I have great difficulty getting off my bike when I arrive at work. Enter this tank bag. It was a bit of pain to get the bag secured to my bike in comparison to the tail bag and saddle bags, but it still took only an hour tops. My bike has plastic over the fuel tank, so no magnets for me. My big gripe here is that the bag is so big, it interferes with my instrument controls. For example, if I turn my handlebars all the way to the left, the bag presses my horn button. I am sure that if I had a wider bike/cruiser, I would not have this issue, and it is really only a problem when I am walking my bike out of the garage.

1758,"I have always been able to work with ease within Paint Shop Pro, and X5 is no exception. Version X5 offers Paint Shop Pro's tools in a threetab interface consisting of the main drawing window, an effects window and an organizer window in which to manage content resources. I originally installed this on Windows 7, but I recently did a fresh upgrade to Windows 8 and it has worked fine having been hosted on both operating systems. The interface looks great. The tools are well organized, and are easily accessible. The software is intuitive enough to make for a fine graphics and photo editor for new and old users alike. It offers layered editing, and it is got very powerful, smoothly operating features. I was initially not as eager to see the interface get split into three parts, but in all fairness, I do believe the effects page is better off on its own tab. I think it was the organizer that bothered me most, since I have always used Window's own folder explorer tools to deal with organization; to have an organizer tab only adds to the bulk of the program when loading up. Switching between the three interface tabs takes a second going back and forth, but I figure if I am doing any one task I will not be jumping around too often. The tool set provides a great starting point for the graphic artist on a budget. It is the perfect package for those who want something flexible enough to be creatively useful, but inexpensive enough to be affordable. I have noticed that, at times, the Ultimate edition can be found for only five dollars more, so if bonus filters and photo editing hoopla sound good, you might want to compare the Ultimate Edition before you",Graphic art for a budget,An Old Favorite Evolved

Battery life is pretty good, but the standby was nowhere like what is claimed. Texting works, but at 6 characters per screen full it can take some time to read each one. The display is just plain cool. I think I think half the reason I bought it was just to have an Eink display. It is very thin and light for a phone, but it is a good density so it does not feel cheap. It has no features to speak of, but that is why it is so inexpensive. This phone has a couple of minor annoyances: One is that it will not set the time from the network. Other GSM phones I have used lately have done that. You have to set it each time you turn it on. Also, the charger is unlike any other Motorola charger tip I have ever seen. I just assumed it was a miniUSB or the older style Motorola with the clip and pushbutton, but it is not. You will always have to carry a charger when you plan to be away longer than the battery should last. Finally, the headset jack is shared with the charger, and is therefore completely proprietary. That seems odd in 2008 in the age of Bluetooth and 2.5mm mini jack standards. But, then Motorola seems to be on a proprietaryeverything bender the last few years.

When I came here tonight to write my final assessment, I noticed that I was not alone in my frustrations. As noted by others, for the most part, it worked surprising well however, I was also surprised when the dictate function on my iPhone worked so well. BUT, corrections are insanely frustrating to the point where I wondered if this could actually become less of a convenience and more of a nuance to a fairly proficient typist.

Likewise, little quirks and bugs prevented me from walking about my office and dictating which is what I am most likely to do. Likewise can be said of when I am inserting textual evidence from a book or an article. I found that if I failed to maintain a close watch on the computer screen, my work might be lost and even more time wasted.

For me, as an academic who needs to insert ample evidence and maintain strict MLA Style, I do not believe it is possible to use this software at this time.

1782,"Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it unlike many of today's contenders is a true American masterpiece. Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities. As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay. This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrowminded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred. That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.

We know how it is to be bored with retirement when one's spouse has entered a new and challenging career. Golf holds no interest for Mr. Walker and he is given a second chance when an invitation arrives to join The Last Chance group of former law enforcement officers who study unsolved murder cases.

1792,"I am not a makeup hound. I do not shop at Sephora and Ulta. I find something I like and I stick with it forever. Recently, I have been eyeing all kinds of liquid eyeliner. My sister dragged me reluctantly into Sephora and I found this Lorac Waterproof Eyeliner. I was sold.

The thing that sets this one apart from others is the incredibly thin line it creates. This allows even the most liquid eyeliner newbie to apply with ease. Then, I can build the lines up to create a thicker line if I want to. As far as waterproof, my first use was at a funeral and by the end of the very long day, my eyeliner was still intact and still looked good. THAT IS impressive.

I plan on finding out what other colors they offer and picking those up, too.",My hair was still intact and I will never see it!,Perfect!

It took a while to download onto my ASUS laptop which runs OS Windows 7, 64 bit with 4GB of RAM. I have since learned that this program needs a minimum 6GB of RAM to run on a 64 bit system This program really is easy for a beginner to put together awesome looking slideshows movies. There are several templates, some free music which can be used to spice up your production...and some music that can be purchased or you can use your own music. The first project I put together was a slideshow that used several photos. After saving that slideshow, I have never been able to open it again. It crashes the entire program each time I try. I do not know if I did something wrong in the process of putting it together or it is crashing because I am using 4Gb of RAM instead of 6GB. Each time the program crashed there was a popup which sent an error report to CyberLink. My next project was a video. I previewed several templates before choosing the one I liked best. I added music too. The video never crashes the program always opens. It needs some editing, but I am happy with my progress so far. I was even able to rotate the video which was upside down was taken with an iPod Touch. I really, really like all the templates that are provided in the program.

1801,"I bought the Proxxon instead of the Dremel. The Proxxon is very quiet compared to the Dremel which is screaming loud at high RPM. The Proxxon appears to be extremely rigidly built unlike the Dremel. It weights about a pound and has about the dimensions of the 300 Series Dremel. You can change the speed from 5k to 20k RPM and the motor is wave controlled to maintain its speed under load unlike the Dremel which slows down under load. It comes with a set of drills and milling bits as well as cutting wheels. I also bought the drill stand MB 140/S and vice MS 4. The bits appear to be well priced. Notice that Amazon sells many of the bits in kits as noted in the product descriptions while most other places sell just a single package of the bits. Dremel bits should fit as well but I did not try this. I am intending to use it for regular repair jobs around the house. The only bad thing I noticed is that the case does not keep things in place when you carry it and you better put the bits in a little baggy instead of the included bit holder. I bought the Proxxon because this unit is regularly used for industrial applications over many hundred of hours while many people reported that they fried several Dremel units at simple jobs like cutting into dry wall. A small rotary tools is extremely versatile and you can do a lot of things with it like drilling, grinding, sanding, polishing, milling, cutting sawing, engraving, or routing in many materials like ferrous metals, precious metals, stone, glass, plastic, or wood.

1806,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

Its scent is sharply citron/citrus without much of an afternote, smelling nice when it goes on but fading fairly quickly as it should. When applied thinly, the product disappears into the skin in seconds, leaving it feeling soft and pleasant for several hours afterward it is a really nice cream for hands or faces. Do note that it is so richfeeling because it is based on macadamia nut oil, which might be an allergy problem I actually checked it with a friend with a nut allergy and found the product did not provoke a reaction from momentary contact, but it is probably best to be cautious.

1811,"God really wants us to be healthy, and so many times in the name of ""ministry"" we shrivel up our lives, our families, and our hearts.  Peter Scazzero has written a book on this very topic that I think should be next on the ""to read"" list of every pastor, and every person considering becoming a pastor and even those of key volunteer positions at churches. Peter addresses what it means to be emotionally healthy and unpacks some of the ""taking the high road"" misconceptions Christians carry.  Now, this is not another attempt to be Dr. Phil for Christians.  Open this book and check out the chapters and if you can read the first chapter, give it a glance.

I really believe this book has opened a journey that I must take and as I walk this path of discovery.  Through this experience I will begin to understand my past, my pains, my passions, and my weaknesses; it will help me cope; and perhaps it will lead those around me to be emotional healthy and a move closer to God.  I hope it is as helpful for you as it has been for me.","God really wants us to be healthy; so many times in the name of ""ministry"" we shrivel up our lives, and their hearts","MUST READ FOR PASTORS, by a pastor"
1812,"""A Shot In The Dark"" is the first sequel to ""The Pink Panther"". Or, it is the first in the series of Inspector Clouseau movies. Take your pick. Peter Sellers, as Clouseau, was part of the ensemble cast that made ""The Pink Panther"" such an excellent movie. But Blake Edwards quickly realized that he had stumbled onto something special. ""A Shot In The Dark"" was the first movie where Inspector Clouseau was the main character. It also introduced Clouseau's boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus Herbert Lom, and Kato Bert Kwouk, both of whom became fixtures throughout the rest of the series. On the other hand, it continues with the pink panther animation and the Henry Mancini theme from ""The Pink Panther"", despite the fact that this is the only film in the series that does not have ""The Pink Panther"" in the title. Nor is the mythical diamond in the plot. All this aside, the formula that developed with this movie is a good one. Sellers is hilarious as Clouseau and, of the Clouseau series, this one is the most tightly plotted and works the best. A chauffer in a wealthy household is shot dead in a room belonging to a maid. The maid is found with the gun in her hand. Clouseau, mistakenly assigned to the case, is smitten by the maid Elke Sommer and is determined to prove her innocent. A madcap caper with a surprise ending ensues. The scene in the nudist camp is the most famous, but this movie is riddled with funny lines and hilarious scenes. Sellers was a brilliant comedian, and this is possibly his best movie. If you are a fan of Sellers work, you cannot be without this one. If you are unfamiliar with Sellers, this is an excellent chance to give him",Very funny,A Very Good Shot

If I would known that this compact Optima 40 existed, though, I might have just gone with it instead, at least for home use, as the 70 really is a little bit of overkill for me and I can put this in my laptop bag to carry around with me. I do realize not everyone wants to carry a stapler around with them. The 40 is compact for a high capacity stapler, but is still a little bit bigger, total volume, than a standard stapler. I think this is shorter by an inch or two, but taller by about the same. Ie, its profile is closer to square than a standard stapler which you can probably tell from the picture. So it is not tiny, but again, for a high capacity stapler, it is a very nice size. Functionally, it is great I have had no problems. I regularly have because to staple stacks of 20 pages, but rarely a full 40; this has handled like a champ everything I have thrown at it so far. I am just using whatever standard Swingline staples I already had on hand not the special kind the Optima 70 gets, probably the same kind you would put in a normal Swingline stapler like the one from Office Space, for example. The backs of the staples get folded flat against the paper, rather than curled in as with a regular stapler, which I strongly prefer. It avoids the risk of the ends poking back through the front of the paper, feels smoother, and takes up less space. They are also easier to remove.

I read online that Micellar is somewhere between a toner and a cleanser.  It should remove makeup waterproof formulas too dirt and oil from the skin without stripping your completion.

According to dermatologist Dr. Macrene AlexiadesArmenakas, it all comes down to little molecules called micelles. ""Micelles are nanosized, singlelayer fatty bubbles,"" explained Dr. AlexiadesArmenakas. ""They are able to absorb other fats such as sebum and oils inside."" Consider: though olive oil and balsamic vinegar separate from each other, two oils would blend together.

So this lists that it is: Soapfree. Alcoholfree. Colorantfree. pHbalanced. Allergytested. Noncomedogenic. Suitable for sensitive skin. Safe for contact lens wearers.

So what did I think?
I do not have waterproof makeup but I thought it took off my mascara decently. I would go over my eyes one more time with my eye makeup remover.  I also felt like it made my eye lids stick I could feel it when I blinked .  I do not have anything negative about it that I noticed after trying it for a week.  I used it with a round makeup wipe and I defiantly would see lots of makeup on it.

It does stick out at the bottom but in my Tacoma truck, a cross member is lower than the valve, which protects the valve from debris striking it.  Would be very careful putting these valves on any vehicle where it hangs low as it can catch or get hit from road debris.

1858,"I currently subscribe to three science magazines  Scientific American, Discover, and Science Illustrated. Of the three, I like Scientific American the best, but I must say that I enjoy all three.

Scientific American seems to have more of the lengthier feature articles that go into more depth on a particular subject. For instance, in the latest issue I am currently reading December 2011 there are nine feature articles covering a diverse array of subjects such as: technology, space exploration, biology, climate change, neuroscience, animal behavior, forensics, and education. I always find a number of articles that I am interested in reading in every issue.

Some articles I found very interesting in recent past issues are:

 Hidden Switches in the Mind  a fascinating article on epigenetics.
 Waiting for the Higgs  an article about the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs.
 The First Americans  who were these people and how did they get here.
 A Formula for Economic Calamity  an interesting article on Wall Street's betting our future on flimsy science.

There are also many departments covering various subject matter. In this issue, I count twelve departments. Some departments I find interesting are Advances, The Science of Health, Skeptic, and Recommended. These cover short special interest topics.

As a science aficionado, I can certainly recommend this magazine for those of you interested in the sciences.",A great read!,An Excellent Science Magazine

1861,"Feels/Plays Like: Crackdown, Jet Set Radio. Sunset Overdrive is a fun game, but lacks any long term engagement sadly. The game is easy to pick up with a control scheme that feels natural and intuitive. The game play is fun and frantic, and the XBOX ONE chews its up, even when things are blowing up like crazy and you would expect there to be frame rate drops or slow down. It handles all the graphical mayhem without any issues, which was frankly somewhat surprising. As fun as this game can be and as good as it looks, I hate to say there is no replay value, but from my perspective, there does not really seem to be any. Maybe the upcoming DLC will change that, but from having played through the campaign, past all the silliness and fun I had doing that, there really does not seem to be any reason to come back to this title. Part of the problem with the lack of replay value is, there are certain guns you can unlock pretty early on that are extremely overpowered and make it so the enemies are little more than a blip on the radar as far as challenge goes. I unlocked the hairspray launchers and it was just a matter of shooting that into a crowd a few times and everything was dead without issue. I love the diversity of weaponry in this game, but the guns are incredibly imbalanced and like I said, overpowered to the point of removing any real challenge or aspect of danger from the game. There is also an odd pseudocelebrity appearance, that while I knew who it was and was pretty jazzed by it, I doubt sincerely anyone under 25 is going to have any clue who this person is, or","A fun game, but lacks any long term engagement sadly.","Fun Good Looking Game, Lacks Replay Value, Wait For A Price Drop To Pick This Up"
1862,"This is a great moisturizing cream. It is rich and thick and better yet, it lasts for hours. I can put this on under makeup as well as on my neck and hours later I can still feel the softness on my skin. This is also a great nighttime moisturizer. This is a very versatile cream for day or night use. It works flawlessly under makeup and it works very well in conjunction with the Vichy Neovadiol Magistral Elixir. These two products together are wonderful and are useful in the antiaging arena.

I have had not breakouts with this product as I have experienced with other moisturizers and this really works to soften dry skin. I had a cold where around my nose, my skin got chapped and dry but this cream cleared up the dryness in no time. This is a really wonderful moisturizing cream that I cannot say has had any drawbacks for me, only benefits so far.",Great moisturizing cream,Excellent Moisturizer

1872,"I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.  An attempt is made to segregate it, but if you watch any of the company's videos, you will see there is an overwhelming amount of data.  It is all good mind, you and it is easy to get lost looking at pictures, seeing videos, watching trails.

It is a superb product, but I can easily see where some people might get overwhelmed.  Still, if you dive into it, you are going to experience the Bible in a completely new way.  Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion.  In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It is kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.

One issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That is not too bad.  But if you want to do the ""full"" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I have installed multi disc programs before, and they have not taken anywhere near that amount of time.  Once it was all installed, the C:\ProgramData\Glo directory on my Windows 7 machine had a total of 10.8Gb of data, and a whopping 351,892 files!  Wow.",I love this product!,Really cool new way of looking at the Bible!

The great feature that I had not expected at all was that this body was does the trick on recentlyapplied antiperspirant.

1878,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

1879,"I felt that I needed to own this a few months before writing a decent review of this player, and now I have come to that time. Pro: The carrying case that this comes with is really nice pads the DVD player well. It makes transport a bit easier, and certainly helps me worry less that the player could get damaged. The remote control that comes with this works fine. This is such a simple player that there is very little learning curve with using either the item itself or the remote control. I only use the remote during times when I use this for workout DVD playback, because I am too far from the player to pause it directly. It is a very small remote if you have little kids around, put it up where it is out of reach or it will probably disappear quickly! This really is a nice thing to have in a blackout or other situation where electricity is not available you are just bored to tears. Just my opinion, but I was glad to have it during a recent hurricane. Con: Even when fully charged, I only get four hours of playback max. I just bought this a few months ago, and it is been like this since I got it. I wish that the charging cord was a little longer. I cannot even plug it in to the electrical outlet right next to bed, put the corded DVD player on my bed watch it the cord's too short. I added an extension cord to it so that it would not be an issue anymore but for the cost, I wish they would have at least included a longer a shorter cord for differing needs.

1884,"I can understand the acclaim this recording has garnered.  And while I am listening to the performance, I am in total agreement.  BUT, when the stereo goes off, I remember nothing of significance about the interpretation.  Sure, the Berlin Philharmonic is the gorgeous instrument it usually is; the  engineering is fine, and there is nothing controversial about the  performance.  But is this all Brahms had on the page?  No, I do not think  so.  I think the problem is that Abbado gave us the notes on the page,  coupled with some beautiful orchestral execution, but nothing else.  Superficial, perhaps.  My favorite 3rd is Walter's on Sony, orchestral  flaws Columbia Sym and everything.  Karajan's 70s cycle on DG had a fun  3rd, and I just saw that Horenstein has a recording out with SW German  Radio Orchestra.  All I bet are better than this firstclass engineered  disc.
Finally, Tragic Overture is nothing special, either.  HOWEVER, the  choral piece is memorable, and is worth keeping.  The climax is  overwhelming.

1891,"Alcoholfree toners are a mixed bag for me. Some of them are ineffective for my oily summer skin. But so far, this one has been great which is good because I have an absolutely huge container of it that will likely last months, even used twice a day. It is moisturizing and nondrying but it has some fruit extracts, including fruit acids. These, I think, are critical. See the full ingredients list by zooming in on the product image of the back of the container. They have some mildly astringent properties that actually tone/tighten the skin based on my experience, but they also do a bit of gentle exfoliation. If you have sensitive skin and cannot take strongly acidic toners, this may be an option for you. I am a big fan of exfoliators, especially gentle ones like this because I sometimes go overboard with the scrubs and have to dial things back a bit. But it is hard to go overboard with this type of product as long as you apply it with a gentle or nonscractchy cotton pad. This really is the orange color from the photo, which is sort of unusual for a toner, especially one without artificial dyes. So I think there are tons of fruitbased antioxidants in this, which is awesome for a little extra measure of protection from free radical damage e.g., from sun exposure. Of course you should also use a sunscreen when using this product. I find this to have a mild but pleasant scent that does not stick around for long after application. It does not irritate my eyes at all of course I do not get toner in my eyes, but sometimes if other toners get a bit close, they can sting this one does not. I use this morning",Totally great,happy with this toner; gentle and effective but also alcohol free

1893,"At the outset, I suggest looking at the numerous videos on YouTube or at FHI's website search for FHI Stylus or FHIBrands dot com for pointers on how to use this styling brush. This styling brush does a lot of things well, and some things not quite as well. If you are looking for big waves and flattening or controlling small sections of hair, this tool is great. If you are looking for a straightener for lots of hair or a curling iron to make tight curls, other tools will probably work better. However, if you are looking for a single tool that will do just about everything except for small tight curls, this tool is the one to get. For big waves and big curls, this device is great. The brush is light and the temperature settings are easy to use. The settings are approximate for each type of hair. The easiest way to figure out the temperature to use is to start with a setting lower than you think you need, and see how well that temperature works. Overheating hair is generally not a good idea, and can damage hair, so easing into a temperature setting from the low side is better than going past the optimal temperature. The brush heats up quickly. Most of the ceramic areas heater areas have bristles to minimize the chance of burning hands and fingers, but the edges of the brush can get warm. I am always careful around heated styling tools, though the hottest areas on this brush are difficult to reach. Use the brush on a section of hair at a time. The size of the section matters and changes the ultimate effect. Experiment with different size sections and different curling techniques wrapping the hair clockwise or counterclockwise, wrapping hair",Great for a large hair size,A good multi-purpose styling tool with lots of features

This product has a high percentage of zinc oxide, which is excellent for clearing acne and red spots.
Most individuals recommend against using diaper rash cream because the petroleum in the cream clogs pores, which mitigates the benefit of using the zinc oxide. This product does not have petroleum. It does have beeswax, though. So YMMV.
For me, it works as a red spot and acne remover. Wash and dry your face with a cleanser. Then apply a small amount on the red spot or acne. It will disappear overnight.

1901,"Jameson Thottam as Sam Fischer in Splinter Cell Splinter Cell a Tom Clancy project began in 2002 with the XBox version of Splinter Cell the game that blew gamers away by graphical shadowing alone. The game was intended to be the first ""true"" stealth game and rival the DieHardlike competitor Metal Gear Solid. In some ways, even then, the game seemed revolutionary. Sneak in the cloak of shadows and through the gaps of broken light in silence to destroy enemies was basically what Splinter Cell was about. Despite the neat gadgets the game had surveillance cameras that dispersed gas, guns that fried electrical units, the game seemed simple; in fact it was simple in a linear interpretation. When the game ended, there was no real reason to go back through the game, even if it was an instant classic. So, out came Pandora Tomorrow, two years, later that tried to expand Splinter Cell. In some cases, it did; larger levels were built, the lighting was better adjusted, and it even featured multiplayer. But, once again, when the time came for the game's completion, Pandora Tomorrow fell shallow even with the multiplayer. So, out comes Chaos Theory; a game where they expanded the levels even larger, readjusted a few things, and added a few perks to enhance the gameplay and make it worth a second, or third, go through. Did their attempt succeed? Yes it did. So much that it not only impressed me, but made me realize that UbiSoft is the next major contendor in thirdparty manufacturers and may just be the next Rareware although Rareware is a secondparty company, but you know what I mean....

It goes without saying that since sand is the major component of this toy, it is going to be messy, so if that gives you the vapors, do not buy this set. As far as being a toy with longevity, as in a toy that will sustain a child's interest for more than 30 minutes, the Mash Mold has enough components and variations on play to keep the kid entertained for months. The premise is this: You make building blocks out of the magic sand included. It really is magic stuff, too. There are other manufacturers of similar stuff, so look around if you want to augment the seriously inadequate supply that comes in this set.. There are various molds to use, as well as tools to sculpt with. You build things out of the blocks. You tear down your projects using either the wrecking ball or TNT. Repeat. There is plenty of opportunity for creativity, and with some adult supervision, even very young children would enjoy it. My six year old grandson was skeptical when we unpacked the box, but was soon fitting pieces together and demonstrating how to use the various components. Let me add that neither of my grandchildren are familiar with BTB. Their parents consider it a show in which unkindness and meanness are recurring themes, so neither child has ever watched it.

Yes, it is a bit ragged in places but not enough to ruin the viewing experience.  I cannot really complain; I have seen worse transfers on television.  A few fuzzy bits of stray light and whatnot are par for the course.  It was the film I was after.  And until they come up with a better remastered version this one will do for my collection.

1965,"The wife is a bird feeding nut. It seems we are always adding more, and replacing ones that break or wear out. This was an addition to another ground feeder she already has. I am not sure why she insists on feeding the rabbits and squirrels by putting out ground feeders, but there are birds that like to eat on platform feeders. Unlike the other platform feeder we have, this one has a grate that sets in the tray above the seed to make it harder for animals to clean it out.

This is very sturdy, so looking out and seeing the rabbits sitting in it will not bend it. The finish reminds me of granite wear pans, but I suppose it is power coated. Either way, it should hold up well. At least until someone shoots a hole in it trying to get that opossum that kept eating all the seed every night; but that is another story.

This platform feeder comes with a stake to put in the center of the pan and shove into the ground. It also comes with a hanger that attaches to the pan so that it can be hung on a hook or tree limb. Like we have any open limbs, and the dozen poles are all full too. Over all, this is well made and should last a long time. The Bird Wife gives it both thumbs up.",This was an addition to another ground feeder she already has,Very well made.
1966,"These are cute little items, and work fine for awhile. Note that a few of them were DOA  probably due to batteries going out. The batteries are technically sealed, but if you are careful and handy, you could pry the little devices open to replace the batteries. Frankly, as cheap as they are, replacing batteries would be more expensive than buying a new box.

Kinds being kids, these gadgets will not last long. The batteries drain rather quickly, so do not expect more than a few days use out of them, if that. More like ONE night event if these are for a party or dance or something. They are basically disposable lights  as in, use them for a party and that is about it. Not as in ""biodegradeble"".

1967,"I bought this because of the claimed durability. I wanted a camera I could use on my motorcycle and should I get caught in the rain it would not be a problem or the vibration would not hurt it.

Well, it has this touch feature that is supposed to allow you to take pictures w/ ease. The trouble, I cannot shut it off. I have it mounted on the motorcycle and it interprets the vibration of the road and engine as me requesting it to take a picture. Quite annoying. It does okay w/ video but will not zoom while you are shooting video.

The shutter lag is also tough on a motorcycle as you are moving and want to get a picture when you want it, not 1.3 secs later or whatever it takes.

Has to be something better out there.

I am looking forward to reading more about them. Aleesha and Marcus on the other hand are, in my opinion, just two whorish individuals who deserve to be together.

The fact that it does have Metro and does NOT have a start menu, keeps me from giving it 3 stars. To get the same functionality, I have to install third party software and repurchase DVD functionality and Media Center, which I already had before...and used. In desktop mode funny because it is a desktop anyway, the interface is a lot smoother. I have noticed that they made some real improvements with network connectivity on the Xbox 360. Whenever I wanted to listen to music from my Xbox to my home stereo using Win 7, it would only connect about half the time, making it unreliable. With Windows 8, the connection is virtually 100. Of course, Microsoft overdid it and, my xbox imports all my file folders too, which gives me a big mess of empty folders it cannot read. With all the sophistication of the Xbox, you still rely on folders...really? Regarding the Metro interface, it is a good tablet OS, but why on earth would you bolt a tablet interface to an OS designed for a desktop?? It is just plain stupid! Oh yeah, take away the start button...and menu, then put settings and folders in places where no one can find them unless they navigate through a tablet interface with their mouse and keyboard. Fortunately, there are third party programs like ""Classic She Will"" that adds a start menu and boots straight to the desktop.

In my opinion nobody does it better when it comes producing a publication for hikers and campers that just cannot get enough of the great outdoors.  One thing I have always liked about this magazine the most is how it never fails to regularly return to the basics.  That is to say, it does not always assume that you are a seasoned hiker that well understands the joy and dangers of just getting away from it all in the wilderness.  It regularly carries a generous amount of articles and regular features that are fundamental enough for the novice reader or backpacker, as well as stories that deal with easier, family style hikes. It truly is not all about just zeroing in on the big bear country adventures that the seasoned backpacker will prefer.  Though its true that there are more glossy style ads in it than ever before, as well as pull out subscription order cards and ads, what magazine does not these days, it still in my opinion sticks to its guns very well in being a very interesting and excellently written magazine that I enjoy as much today as I did years back when I could actually do some of the hikes that it talks about.  I highly recommend Backpacker for its quality articles and photography, and tenaciousness in staying with what made it a great magazine all these years... smile face",Best hike magazine ever,Love It......Always Have
1998,"Kudos to Maria Muldaur for paying tribute to the rich music of the Mississippi Delta in a way that maintains the respect and integrity for the music, but appeals to the modern ear. Helping her in this are many artists with similar roots and love of the blues music as musical veterans Bonnie Raitt , Taj Mahal, John Sebastian, Tracy Nelson, Angela Strehli, Roy Rogers and Alvin Youngblood Hart. Maria received inspiration for this venture after a spontaneous performance with street musicians on Beale Street in Memphis. She sang Me and My Chauffeur Blues a Memphis Minnie tune filled with delightful innuendo and having the same chord progression as Good Morning Little Schoolgirl. For Maria this experience was enlightening and inspiring. This music is vital and tangible years after it was first performed. Maria Muldaur, a seasoned musician has been performing since the 60's where she got her start in a jug band in the Greenwich village folk seen. She sharpened her teeth on such artists as Mississippi John Hurt, Leadbelly, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Bessie Smith and Memphis minnie. After performing various styles of folk, pop, blues and rock over the years, Maria returned to pay tribute to the roots of the blues. In Richland Woman Blues she sings the pared down style of the delta, having only acoustic, slide guitar or piano for backup. Throughout the cd Maria Muldaur exhibits her expressive vocal skills. She can vary from sweet and melodic to gritty and tough as is required by the songs which she sings. Choices of songs range from gospel with It is a Blessing, to saucy double entendre in Put it Right Here, to a fun cat fight in My Man Blues to lonesome laments in Far Away Blues. While this will be appealing to blues traditionalist, I",Modern Blues artist,"Forget the Camels, Meet Her in the Delta"

2001,"My earliest memories of Blade Runner go back to the Fall of 81. As a kid, I was a subscriber to Starlog Magazine. It was a popular scifi movie mag of the time. It featured an article on Harrison Ford's next film ""Blade Runner"". The article showed a few production shots of the Spinner and some of the overall aesthetic. Here I was, 12 years old, and my favorite actor was about to delve into yet another scifi/fantasy flick. I was thrilled!! I figured..here is Han/Indy playing a futuristic cop hunting killer androids in an environment of flying cars and neon. What more could a kid ask for??? Fast forward to June 1982...My best friend and I sneak into our first ""R"" rated movie together. Nearly thirteen years old...I watched the opening sequence with delight and wonder. It was an incredibly realized world. However...as the film progressed...I simply did not get it. It felt too dark, depressing, and wrought with DIALOGUE instead of ACTION. In other words...it was not FUN. However, something struck a chord with me. I never could pinpoint what it was as a thirteenyearold. It still befuddled me the following year when it made it is HBO debut, but I watched it religiously each time it aired. Here we are now, some twentynine years after it is debut, and I am STILL finding new ways to view this film. This is why Blade Runner remains, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most important films in cinematic history. The film CHALLENGES you on so many levels. On one side, it is a scifi thriller...on another, a deep and thought provoking look into the metaphysical dimensions of humanity. It questions what it means to be ""human"" and, by extension, what it means to BE. These philosophical questions","This is why Blade Runner remains, in my opinion.",A surreal look into what it is to be human...

2012,"I am new to routers.  Wanted to try having a good experience on first attempt so used it with CMT router bit set which cost more than this router set.  This worked better than expected.  Used the combo on red oak, oak, and birch.  Used on both solid and plywoods without issue.

Use this router in dhandle and also used the fixed base in a home made router table.  There was some learning curve on my part for proper router use so ruined some Oak legs which was pricey but that was my fault.  I was adding a dado to the legs and going too fast.

One thing I had to get use to was when using the dhandle I let off the trigger and motor cuts off but still spinning down for a little while.  Normally with a drill or saw you just press the trigger and it starts spinning again.  With this router you can press the trigger but no power until the rotation gets below a certain threshhold which could be a 2 second delay before it starts spinning up again.  Just some getting use to.

Very happy with purchase.",I'm new to routers,Worked great.  First time using a router.

I have always liked regular milk but since I have contracted diabetes I cannot drink it due to the excess sugar lactose, I am not lactose intolerant but like all sugars, lactose is turned into glucose in the body so it raises your blood glucose levels when consumed. I have tried soy milk but it just tastes ""funny"" to me and the carbs are still kind of high in some formulas. I now drink Blue Diamond Unsweetened regular and vanilla with little concern for excess sugar I prefer vanilla slightly but they are both good Some people reviewing this product say that it tastes like Almonds.

Well yes so normally I would say just was not our cup of tea. But it also dried out very fast and clumped incredibly badly. The clumping seemed to happen independent of how much or little was put on. Everyday for 4 days and counting we tried it we had at least some clumping we had to deal with. So it just was not a hit for us. It did make the lashes look long and beautiful when it was working.

2025,"Cleans well, lots of suction  better than our central house vacuum system.  Easy to start nice easy access button, easy to stand up nice foot release.  Not overly loud.  Easy to assemble just need a Philips screwdriver.

This is heavy.  We have lots of stairs, and most of my family will not be carrying it up and down the stairs.  So, this will only be used once and a while when I Am around to lift it when we feel that we need to clean extra well, not every time we vacuum.

The orange cord is long enough, but is not retractable, so you need to learn to deal with it, i.e., do not run over it with the vacuum not hard, but just something to deal with.  The cleaning head is wide, which is good or bad depending on your preference.  If you have a lot to clean, its wide to get the job done faster.  But being wide it does not fit into smaller areas so you end up using the attachments when are not that more effective than our other vacuums.  There is no head light on it.

Its easy to clean, and has an indicator that tells you with colors how the filter it doing green is OK, red is time to clean.

2027,"Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in preribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect. It is enlightening! It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version. It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same. The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version. I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present. I do not have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I have been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font there were no fonts except Courier, and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I have worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it are not broke, do not fix it! Universal File Support WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF,",Just what I needed!,The Better Wordprocessor

2057,"Let me start by saying this is my first gentleman's folder, but the facts about this knife make it truly a masterpiece regardless of point of comparison, especially when you consider the price point. It is not THE best knife in the world, but it certainly is a major leader in it is price range, if not THE leader. Finish: The smooth as silk titanium and fiber is a huge pleasure to just touch, incredibly refined, just holding it you feel like you should be drinking martinis with supermodels, truly art. The attention to detail is perfect. Grip: Probably the worst you could have if your hands were oily or wet and definitely not sufficient for self defense, zero jimping or other traction option. This is a classy night on the town, girlfriend in her nicest dress, going out type of knife. Value: Had this knife had a more premium blade steel, $400 or $500 would not be an excessive price tag for it. For a basically solid titanium frame and glass fiber plate $200 is a great price, I had my reservations prior to purchase, but once you touch you will know you made the right decision. Blade: Is 100 perfectly ground and super sharp and has a fine finish relative to the Delica or Manix 2 XL. The spydie hole is small but effective. Yeah it is VG10 which does not excite me, but it is a very well finish blade and VG10 will last just fine. Action: The smoothest action I have ever felt. It is right up there with the Spyderco Gayle Bradley. Zero grit sound, just smooth steel on smooth titanium. There is one downside, the detent is very close to the open and locked position, so if you are slow to engage the knife,",Fantastic knife for anyone who wants to add more value.,"Extreme quality, extreme beauty!"

My mother is an avid quilter, and yes, women put a  lot of thought, pride, and emotion into the things they make whether it is  a quilt, clothing, art, or for that matter books. This book had a great  premise, pretty good character development, and considering the story, the  people within the story had a good sense of humor. I always enjoy humor  within a mystery, and this one definitely made me giggle at times when  reading it late at night. Luckily my husband sleeps through everything!

Outside our own range of experience, we can only guess at some of the things that are going on. You may be thinking  about getting a divorce, you may be flirting with the idea of a separation,  but until you get in there and do it and live it, you really have no idea  what it is all about. Is it possible that films like ""Stepmom"" can help us  make wiser decisions? Would not it be nice.
Both Susan Sarandon and Julia  Roberts give tremendous performances in this film about the end of the  beginning of something new. That it might turn out to include everyone  involved, for a while, leads to both a delightful discovery and a poignant  counterpoint to the original breakdown. This is a film in which everyone  concerned is asked to move forward, whatever their ages. It just may be  that we the audience, are also moved forward a tad, at the same time.

At least two more would put my mind at ease as far as grip and wear.  Also, when I first received it and put it on my legless hihat stand it did not fit.  Then I noticed it would slide on upside down.  Upon closer inspection I saw that the part holding the clamp sticks out over the hole a bit and has a narrow channel that the rod did not fit through.  This is why it fit upside down since it could get a better angle to the receiver.  Then I tried it on my Pearl 900 series stand and it just barely fit.  So, if you have a light to medium duty stand, your good.  Otherwise, be prepared to file it down a little over the hole.  That being said, this is still an invaluable tool to have if you gig regularly.  It shaves at least two to three minutes off your setup/breakdown time, which is crucial!

2080,"I recently got in on the Ben Carson craze and decided to pick this book up for my Kindle. Being one who is always trying to improve himself, I like what the book's description was telling me; only the book description tells about half the story. The first two chapters are really great. They suck you in and give you an idea into what Carson is looking to do with the book. However, roughly 5254 of the book is devoted to people Carson has met over his life and he writes of their amazing lives and/or abilities. This is where, I think, the book was misleading. I believe it to be misleading, because, even though I expected some autobiographical information to help make points on his THINK BIG philosophy, I was not expecting a book where a little more than half of it is an acknowledgment. I am all for giving credit where it is due, and I am glad Carson does not think that he did it all on his own, but I never got the impression that he would spend so much time covering these other individuals that are very vague in helping to make points on his THINK BIG philosophy. What do I mean by vague? He starts off the book describing these individuals without diving into without describing what he believes THINK BIG is to his audience. Several times I read, ""INSERT NAME, who thinks big...,"" and I was left wondering what it meant, in Carson's definition, to THINK BIG. I think it would have been more appropriate to describe what THINK BIG is followed by talking about the other individuals. This would help to drive home points better and it would be clearer how these individuals thought big in Carson's definition. The second half of","Great book, but not enough...",A Little Misleading.

It was difficult to reach the right department since there is no option for digital cameras. I choose ""computers"", however even under this option, there was no digital camera selection. I proceeded with laptops, and the person that quickly connected transferred to me. After trying several options with this tech, he had me completely remove the battery. This solved the issue, and the camera now accepted the Wifi password. If you run in to the same issue, remove the battery  memory card and wait 10 seconds.

Now that this is resolved, backing up photos to our server is easy  click the ""Wifi"" button, then click ok to confirm. Photos back up in a few seconds.

2107,"Every once in awhile, mom screws up on buying/getting toys. This is my bad. Unfortunately, this doll is a disaster in our household and my daughter has given up on it after attempting to play with her for a few hours. This is why: My normally chatty daughter seems to have gotten stage fright when pushing the little spot on the doll's chest. So, we went through about seven different songs of ""NOOOOOO"", or ""Silence MOM, WHAT HELP!"", or ""I do not want to."" Now if these were possibly little melodies that were like nursery rhymes or possible children's tunes, then we could laugh about what the real song was like and what accidentally went through the recording. I figured eventually I could help teach her to say more than a loud screamed word. Unfortunately, these melodies that the doll uses are all her own. Each one sounds like a terrible pop song remix in a high pitched sound. If that does not drive you crazy, then sit your daughter down in front of Frozen with her new singing baby doll. After about twenty minutes, I separated the two of them because my daughter was yelling at the doll for not singing right. Trash day is on Wednesday, so this doll has a date with the recycle bin. I have to admit, mom just did not pick right for this toy. The only reason that I rated this a two star instead of a one star is that it did two things for us: 1. It was the first toy that I did not have to fight with my daughter to take away. I do not know if this is a sign of her growing up a bit, if she is growing out of clingy to dolls, or if we",A disaster for my daughter,This doll is AWFUL!

They enjoy washing their hands more because the soap foams. So I decided to get this refill bag. I am so glad I did. It keeps me in stock for a while. I do put this one in the downstairs bathroom so it gets used the most. I still think I refill it about once a month. So this would last me about 3 months.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

2126,"This is a fun game in many ways, but with some very frustrating drawback. EA Sports has been producing this game for 17 years now and they have received the same criticism for all those years  still they seem unable to do anything about it.

Here goes:
1. As in every other NHLgame in this series, the AI is very bad. Even if you play at the most advanced level, you will very soon dominate the game completely.
2. The goaltenders are just as pathetic as ever. To compensate for not being able to create a decent AI that could make the game challenging, EA Sports insteade made the CPU goaltender almost impossible to score against while your own goalie will drop in almost every puck.

The consequence of these two drawbacks are simple. You will dominate each and every game completely, but you will still loose. Be prepared for you shooting 70 shots and scoring 1 goal while the CPU will shoot 3 shots and score 2 goals. The result is that the games in NHL09 do not resemble real hockey games.

All in all, this is a fun game if you play agains friend and these days it is the only thing I use it to do but totally useless if you want to play against the computer as EA Sports has not been able to develop an AI that would produce realistic games despite 17 years of experience.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

From several feet outside the front door, it sounds like I might have dogs in the back bathroom if my house was a mansion and the back bathroom was 100 yards away. When right in front of the door, it sounds like dogs barking in a metal container. It does not sound like real dogs barking on the other side of the door, at all.

Then I armed it to leave house for an short trip. It appeared to do it is job barked when I left and returned. I armed it before stepping out but it seems to not have ever armed. When I returned from today's trip, it did not bark and instead said ""warming up"" as I was entering the home. I wonder if it was trying to arm the whole time I was gone. In any case I checked all the switches and dials and everything was setup up correctly. I turned it off then on again and it seemed to arm just fine.  Given the price, this product deserves one star.

I have just received my first issue and found that it seems very ""light"" on decorator content. Personally I agree with some of the less flattering reviews of this magazine that the articles can get lost with the ads.

It almost seems as if they used a very budget template to create the article layout. Also the feel of what they are covering seems so spare that even catalogs seem more ""homey"" than the homes they featured. Struck me as odd that all the homes they featured seemed like the set designer was only about 60 done with dressing the shoot. Looked like someone was just moving in and had not finished adding those touches that make it special. Just my opinion....

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

2199,"In this book, Mr. Foer has produced a true work of 21st Century Contemporary Literature. His plot is wonderfully intricate, and his method is superb. The story is told primarily through the narrative of a 9 or 10 year old boy, who has Attention Deficit Disorder ADD. The disorder lends itself naturally to a ""Stream of Consciousness"" technique, as much of an ADD person's thought patterns form in a stream of consciousness, rapidly shifting from one topic to another. Yet Foer works in an incredible amount of information with these initially seemingly unrelated little items. Because of this technique, it does take the reader about 100 pages to start to get the handle on who is who in the story. Nonetheless, as one goes further and further, all things are revealed. And a tenderness and level of feeling is conveyed in a manner that is unique. Foer makes the book not only a reading experience, but in addition a visual, artistic experience for the reader. His use of graphics and pictures compliments perfectly the story itself. His careful introspective analysis of Oskar, the protagonist, allows him to convey things that are so deep and subtle, that they are truly heart wrenching at times, and heart warming at others. And throughout the book, the question of time, of temporal order is challenged. This concept of observing time in different manners, either disjointed or just plain running backwards is the central theme of the book. Oskar's father had died in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. The book references that and many other disasters in human history. But what Oskar seeks, is a real connection to his father. And he does it in many ways, by running time backwards, so he can remember his memories of the past, particularly of",The best book of 21st Century Contemporary Literature,Incredibly Great Stream Of Consciousness

2202,"I have used EVO Herring  Salmon dry food for my nine year old cat since she was a kitten.  I am able to get at local health food store.  This food is based on the ancestral diet for cats, which basically means high protein, low carbs, zero grains.  This food is packed with fish herring, salmon and menhaden, no byproducts of any kind.  It is a great food to keep your cat fit.  My vet comments on how she is so trim and not overweight at all, especially at age 9.  I initially tried the EVO turkey but it  did not agree with my cat.  But the herring  salmon she loves.  Very superior product.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
I usually mix this food with Taste of the Wild Canyon River Feline Formula with Trout and Smoked Salmon.  This food is very similar to the EVO in that there are no grains, low carbs and lots of fish with no byproducts.  I mix a 6.6 lb bag of the EVO with a 5 lb bag of the Taste of the Wild Canyon River food.  I choose to mix the two brands just to give my cat a little taste variety and to broaden her diet a little, the kinds and sources of nutrients she gets.  However, I would not hesitate at all to feed her the EVO alone.",great food!,One of the best dry cat foods you can feed your cat. Quality ingredients keep your cat trim & fit. Worth the price. A++

This is a well manufactured piece.

The shelves/pockets fit women's espadrilles OK  but for men, you would need to buy 2 of these and hang them sidebyside and put one shoe in each parallel pocket.

2204,"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports especially a notebook computer!, the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it and do not clutter the front.  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub,"Excellent device; if you buy one USB hub, this probably should be it."

The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

2228,"This film has not aged well.  It was played during a college ""HipHop  conference"" and was very sparsely attended.  It is interesting in that  Harry Belafonte produced the soundtrack or something significantmost  numbers lean toward wastes of time rather than timelessness.  One also gets  a look at the staged life of an MC/performer/composer...the equipment  especially the ""techie"" stuff that the ""pro""s use is  comically primitive, exposed due to its questionable relevance to the plot.  The dance scenes, the feigned gang war scenes particularly, not only steal  the show but are in this case the only worthwhile tidbits in the whole  thing.  Sideplots and incidental urban characters abound, and not  surprisingly they only weigh down a very heavy plot.  The final scene caps  off the chintzy histrionics and romance in the most extravagant show of  obsolescence and fantasy possible.  This has definite entertainment value,  but it requires the viewer to ignore the movie and indulge in the guilty  pleasure of hoodlums spinning on their heads, landing squarely on their  suede tennis shoes in a pose that embodies the film.

2234,"Before using this product, every season I would deal with intense pain in my right arm from holding the string trimmer at an odd angle while trying to keep it straight for edging. Back pain the first three hours after every lawn edging and trimming  not so good. And the grass was butchered where the string dug in as I edged. I just finished my first use of the Edgit Pro, edging and trimming my 1 acre lawn, with fence all around, a circular drive, and sidewalks. This cut my time in half and the stress much more than that. I followed the instruction on using it holding it lefthanded that was part of the success. I have zero pain in my back or arms. And the edging looks perfect for the first time ever using a string trimmer. The claim is true that you can edge perfectly as fast as you can walk. The chain link fence was no problem when sliding the edge of this thing just under the fence. Did not hang even once. Finally, where the grass along the fence from the other side was poking six inches through the fence I simply turned the flat side parallel with the fence, moved it along the fence, and it cleared out all of the grass with no hanging. No, I do not work for the company or in any other way connected. The product is just that good.",I have no pain in my back or arms,Fantastic!

2235,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit,good kit with some caveats

Seeing that it had ""1850"" in the title, I thought it was an 1850 watt... nope. I always thought that they put the number of watts in the title, so this threw me off. Which leads me to my next point... drying time. Since it is 1500 watts, it took me much longer to dry my hair. I have medium length, thick hair. For the past few years, I have been using my trusty Conair Pro Hairdryer I purchased at Costco. It is an 1850 watt hair dryer, I think paid less than $20 for it. I do not think I have ever paid more than $25$30 for a hairdryer, so in reviewing this, I am comparing it to what I am currently using, dryers I have purchased in the past. This one claims ""reduces drying time up to 50"". That was not the case for me, it actually took me longer! Drying time: 3/5 Not specifying wattage in the description I could not find it, the fact that I thought the ""1850"" in the title was misleading: 0/5. Weight: This is listed as lightweight.

I had never bothered to try AVERAGE Internet Security AVERAGE IS, mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost. I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVERAGE IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVERAGE IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother. AVERAGE IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easytounderstand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active.

One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pulldown menus, not the icons.

2278,"I already own the PDP Trigger Grips for my PS Vita, but when laying down in bed playing, my hands would go numb and cramp up around the half hour to hour mark of gaming. This was getting quite annoying so I started looking for a new solutionand the CTA Grip is that solution!
Since switching over to this grip, my hands do not cramp up as much at all. Only occasionally do I run into a cramping issue. Additionally, the weight of this grip and the PDP grip is roughly the same. What I was surprised the most about was that the L and R buttons are actually easier to hit on this grip than with the trigger grips at least for the game I am currently playing which is Ys Memories of Celceta.

I have combined this grip with an analog stick cover from Cyber for my PS Vita and overall the experience is mostly solid, but still not perfect. This grip is good, but sadly the PS Vita moves around in the grip PS Vita 1000, even with the lock mechanism on.

Furthermore, this grip is being sold by off brand names on other sites for much cheaper so you may want to grab one from those sites or Amazon since they are the same exact product, just not sold with the CTA name. I personally went with this one because I wanted the benefits of Amazon prime shipping and guarantee.

Overall, I would recommend this grip, but I would just try and grab it for the cheapest you can get it for since it is just a fancy piece of plastic.",Great grip for PS Vita,I prefer this grip over my PDP Trigger Grip most of the time...

2301,"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 rightangles before going through the floor into the flexible dryervent hose coming from the dryer. I cannot get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up. Then I pulled it all out and there was not any lint at all that came out. So now I am resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I have attached pictures of it.

2329,"I am going to have to go against the consensus on this one and say that I found this book to be very disappointing. The prose and streamofconsciousness writing style was very hard to follow, the story dragged and dragged for dozens of pages, and out of all the characters including the main character the only one that was likeable in my opinion was Lt. Awn. I made it about half way through before giving up. Based on all the reviews I have read, I really cannot reconcile how this has gotten so many 5 star reviews and so much hype on sites like io9. The book is written in the 1st person perspective of a fragment of a fragment of a shipmind AI inhabiting the body of a ""corpse soldier"" similar to the thrall technology in Neal Asher's Polity books. The perspective is constantly changing between the corpsesoldier fragment, a higher order fragment, and the shipmind itself and is very difficult to follow. Another REALLY annoying idea is that the fragment does not distinguish between genders refers to everyone as her, but other characters do use gender pronouns, and the kicker is the fragment tries to use them when speaking to normal humans. Trying to keep all this straight is really more work than I am willing to put into a book like this, especially when none of the characters are described any any sort of detail. I also did not find the story very interesting, it spends way too filling in seemingly uninteresting background information and not enough time explaining the actual plot, when it does, the continuous perspective shifts and misuses of gender pronouns makes it all the more difficult to follow. Also it seemed to me like there were some major editing errors, because even despite","""Squabbles"": I made it about half way through before giving up","Don't believe the hype - very difficult to read, not worth the payoff."

2332,"2 oz. 59mL Original Gorilla Glue, Model: 50002 , by Tools Hardware. Note: This is a product review only, and not an endorsement of the vendor. There may be less expensive vendors available. The Gorilla Glue Company makes many different glues, in different colors and container sizes. The one I am reviewing is the 2 oz. size of the original brown colored Gorilla Glue. This glue will dry out in the bottle, so I do not recommend buying larger bottle sizes, unless the glue will be used in the near future. For most of us, we use a little glue, and put the bottle away until needed the next time. This glue is interesting, in that you wet the surfaces, add a thin layer of glue, and clamp the surfaces together for 12 hours. In the meantime, the glue will expand and turn into a hard foam. After application, any exposed expanded glue may be peeled away or squashed back down a bit while it is drying, so that the repair is not so noticeable. This stuff will eventually dry as hard as a rock. Overall, I would give this glue an Amazon rating of four and a half stars, rounded off to five stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers. Note: This glue will not stick to plastics very well, so for that, I use the old style Testors Cement For Plastic Models, No. 3512, 7/8 fl. oz. 25.8mL UPC Code: 0 75611 35120 9, and yes, it may be hard to find, as kids used to get high and sick from sniffing the fumes from it in a paper bag. Most model cements nowadays are safer to use, but do not stick as well. The old stuff would literally melt the plastic pieces being glued",Great glue!,"Good For Most Things, Except Plastic."

I almost feel guilty for feeling this way about ""Justice"" since so many others think it is a masterpiece.  Makes me wonder why I do not ""get it.""  Maybe it is the shoddy production.  My God, I have blues recordings from the 1920's and '30s that are better produced than this.  There is no excuse for an album recorded in the late 80s to be this poorly mixed.  Where is the bass? Why do the drums sound like pop guns?  Second, some of these songs seem to be long just for the sake of being long.  Mind you I have nothing against long songs, but some of these songs in particular the second half of the album, seem to go on forever.  It is not that they are bad songs but they seem to go nowhere with nary a hook to be found.  I guess in short I find several of the songs to just be boring.  On the positive, ""Blackened"", ""Justice"", and ""One"" are great tunes.  But as a whole this just does not hold up and does not compare to ""Master Of Puppets"" or ""Ride The Lightning"".  I would even probably put ""Kill Them All"" ahead of ""Justice"".  Granted the songwriting and lyrics were much more mature on ""Justice"" and the intentions were good, but IMHO this is far from the masterpiece some would have you believe.

The gameplay is nothing special, but its guitar hero and that means fun! I personally grew up listening to classic rock thanks to my dad, so I love the songs, but they may not be appealing to today's generation.

note I think the gameplay is significantly harder than rock band games and it is nice to be challenged

The guitar is awesome, I think it looks fantastic and it feels very solid, and the price is unbeatable for an official guitar. It comes with the cool stickers and some sick aerosmith one's, even if you just want a guitar this is a good buy.

It was annoying when I was not participating but when I do the video now I hardly notice it. If you are easily distracted though, this might be a problem for you. The first 20 minute segment is a progressive add on sequence, which means you gradually learn moves and put them together. None of the moves are particularily dancy, and kathy does tell you some adjustments if you do not like some of the moves. Once you learn the entire sequence you repeat it a few times. The second 20 minute segment has 4 different segments of exercises and gives you two options: high impact or low impact. You start by learning the moves in the low impact group then after a few minutes you switch to a higher intensity calorie burst. You have the option of following the low impact people on one side of the screen or modifying some of the moves and following the high impact people on the other side of the screen. There is a short 7 minute stretch afterwards. Like I said before, this is a great video for people who only have a few",Great video for cardio,2 Fun 20 minute workouts for the busy!

2378,"I am not a large or longtime Stephanie Plum fan, so perhaps that is why I liked  Ten Big Ones while many fans did not.  Ten Big Ones delivers a roller coaster ride in an amusement park, no more and no less. We do not get the depth of, say Nevada Barr or Margaret Maron, but we do not get halfbaked attempts, either.

Evanovich's heroine, Stephanie Plum, gets herself into one scrape after another. Her car gets shot up. She sees a killer she is not supposed to see. She hides out in an apartment belonging to a dangerous man.  And as soon as she manages to handcuff a bail jumper, you know something is going to go wrong.

Parts of this book hover on laughoutloud slapstick, especially episodes with Carol the chip junkie and Grandma Mazur. And yet the writing remains consistently high quality, often a model for other writers: ""Morelli was lean and hard muscled, with wary cop eyes that softened in the bedroom.""  Now that is description!

So if you can take a deep breath and accept the surreal quality of Stephanie Plum and her life, you are in for a carnival type treat...just do not let yourself wonder what Stephanie Plum says to her insurance company and what they will charge for comprehensive and collision next year.",Two Stars,Delivers what is promised

2409,"As Country Ghetto had a bigger sound than Lochloosa, Orange Blossoms has a bigger sound than Country Ghetto.  Not only is the sound more electric than Mofro's first two albums, now there are prominent horn arrangements. As J.J. has observed, Tony Joe White has always been one of his main inspirations, and even the swamp fox himself has used horn arrangements. However, the key to Mofro's music is that no matter how many instruments J.J. adds to the sound, he always makes sure to leave space between the notes.  The album starts with a spare drum riff with plenty of space between the beats.  Guitar and keyboards come in, but never filling in the empty space.  J.J.'s voice comes in, and even when the horns hit there is still space between the notes.  That is, and has always been the essence of Mofro's music, and it is impressive that no matter how much bigger the arrangements have gotten, that essence remains.  This is Mofro's most rocksounding album.  That is not a bad thing.  It is just different.  If you are still looking for another Blackwater or Lochloosa, it should be clear by now that you probably are not going to get it.  J.J. is evolving as a musician, but if you keep an open mind, you might get into it.

For further recommendations, see my review of Lochloosa and Country Ghetto.",I love it,"J.J. Grey's sound keeps getting bigger, but he never loses the essence of the swamp"

These may not be the most durable, although this same company does make a version of these that have leather covers for better durability, but they are slightly heavier and a lot more expensive. Replacing these less expensive knee pads more often will be the better overall value. These are marketed more to the tile and masonry guys, so you do not see them at the hardware stores.

Including the then 5yearold Drew Barrymore. The model making, lighting, location scouting and even the actual shooting of the scenes can be found here.
Listening to Spielberg discuss almost every aspect of the making of this film is fascinating. And you get two versions of the movie. The one he originally cut and the theatrical release. For SciFi fans the original version Steven cut is far more superior.

2424,"Update January 4, 2010: Below I noted the occasional balky response but had not determined whether this was a problem. Unfortunately, it is! I have had another significant episode where the focusing system simply refused to budge and this was in broad daylight. After doing a number of checks on settings, remounting the lens to insure there were no contact issues, the lens simply would not focus i.e. the focus motor was not even trying to focus. Pull out my trusty, but noisy, 18250mm Pentax and . . . zip! All is well. So back to Amazon it goes. Still deciding on whether to stay with this lens and assume that I just got a bad copy or . . . ? The photos are wonderful from the lens so I cannot complain in that regard, but it would be nice to have confidence that it would handle most of the focusing chores for me! For reference, my original setup was the K20d with the Pentax 18250mm. Given my usage, the 18250 is a remarkable walk around lens but I came to realize that its shortcomings can be visible when I printed up some photos from a recent trip to Big Bend National Park in Texas. Specifically, when I had to press things out to the full 250mm end, I wound up with images that were too soft to print at any reasonable size. I made the decision to improve my setup by shifting to a two or three lens system and the first of the purchases was the 1650mm. I purchased this because I needed a bit more width I shoot some home interiors for my business use and the difference between having 16mm vs. 18mm at the wide end is remarkably helpful!

When I reinstalled Quicken Basic, it was from the original version.  I evidently updated the Quicken program at some time and saved files with that version of Quicken.  The original version of Quicken could not read the updated data files.  I wanted to keep the Quicken data files for my reference, so I decided to get a newer version of Quicken.

The new Quicken Basic states that it will not read old Quicken files, so I decided to get Quicken Deluxe.  It installed very easily and it could read my old data files.  It took me quite a while to learn the new version.  When it read the old data file, it made it a ""Hidden"" file.  Quicken Basic did not have hidden files.  It took me a long time to figure out why I could not see the file that Quicken Deluxe said that it had opened.  When I finally figured it out, the data in Quicken Deluxe looked essentially the same as it had in my old Quicken Basic.

However, there are graphing and other features in Quicken Deluxe that make it nicer than Quicken Basic.  I like it a lot.  I will probably do as I did with Quicken Basic and keep this version of Quicken for years.  It suits my needs.

2459,"I purchased the DM6 kit awhile back and, for anyone who may have it or checked it out, the DM7X offers a substantially updated sound module along with redesigned cymbals and bass drum pedal. If you are new to electronic drum kits and perhaps drumming, I think the DM7X provides good value with some fun features. At the risk of repeating my review of the DM6, I think its important to meet electronic drums on their own terms, rather than seeing them strictly as poor substitutes for an acoustic kit. No electronic drum kit is going to fully replicate the sound, dynamics, movement of air, touch and subtle response of real drum heads and cymbals. But if keyboard players can separate synthesizers and electronic timbres from their acoustic counterparts and find ways to be expressive with both drummers should be able to accomplish something similar. A number of things to consider with the DM7X: Physical Setup: Do Not feel limited by photographs of the kit. The support frame does not have to be square. You can position the lower feet further in or out and the upper arms need not run parallel to the feet. In addition, the feet can be locked at any point along the lower bars useful to counteract the weight of the mounted pads depending on how you position them. It all amounts to tremendous flexibility to position the pads, cymbals and pedals vertically and horizontally not just to accommodate the surrounding space i.e. oddshaped room corners, nearby furniture, door handles, etc., but, more importantly as a player, to avoid back strain especially if you are an older player and perhaps not as limber as you once were. Along that line, there is no throne included with the kit and I would strongly recommend spending the",A great DM6 kit,Good Performance and Value in an Update of the DM6

2462,"Update:  All three cups I bought are now broken.  They are very delicate.  Recommend only for people who are very careful.



The ergonomics, appearance and straw are all very nice on these units, but they just do not hold up.

I love everything about these cups except the bond between the inner and outer cups.  There is merely a very small contact area at the top lip where the inner cup is fused to the outer cup.  I have bought three of these cups and two have already broken apart inner cup separates from outer cup from minor accidents with very low milage.  One accident was my daughter dropping the cup with ice almost no weight one foot to the floor.  Also humidity works its way in between the two walls I hand washed only.  After I break the thrid one I will be buying the 24oz Starbuck's not a fan of Starbucks cup that has a screw thread attachment between inner and outer walls which is likely stronger and can be cleaned when vapor gets between the inner and outer walls.

If you are the average person, you will not have this cup very long.  If you are very gentle and careful, this may be the cup for you, but you will end up with vapor in between the walls after any appreciable use.",Very nice,I can't recommend this cup

2465,"I have never been obsessed, or even mildly fascinated, by the concept of vampires. While I am still not, the film adaptation of Anne Rice's novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE does provide an evening's worth of above average entertainment. It is a tough job being a vampire, but in Rice's lurid world somebody has to do it. The film opens in modern day San Francisco where bloodsucker Louis Brad Pitt gives an interview to a journalist Christian Slater. For the record and for the audience in an extended flashback, Louis begins his story in 1790s New Orleans where he was a plantation owner, who crosses paths with the vampire Lestat Tom Cruise. Lestat is looking for a bud to hang out with, and seduces Louis with immortality's allure. Louis has nothing better to do with his idle life, and so allows himself to be transformed into one of the Undead. After a period of knocking around together, the boys decide that their N'Awlins flat needs, I guess, the feminine touch. So, Louis stumbles upon and bites the neck of a 12 yearold plagueorphan, Claudia Kirsten Dunst. The girl is so fetching that our heroes decide to keep her around, and Lestat subsequently transforms her into an addition to their minicoven. The trio are thick as thieves for years until bad things start to happen. I cannot really award more than 4 stars because, for me, other vampire films have been more impressive. SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE 2001 was more cleverly done by far. And DRACULA 1979, starring Frank Langella, while not considered a great film, had scenes of cinematic artistry not matched here. Indeed, much of the power of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE comes from visuals perhaps composed for their shock value. The plot of this film is largely the","Intense and intriguing, but lurid",Slather on the SPF 50 sunblock

2473,"Did you ever imagine what it would be like to be the love interest of a really hot rock star? Well neither did Layla until she finds herself at a Ozstryker rock concert. Sexy as sin rock stars, two sisters, and a chance of a lifetime sets the tone of this fantastic book. Layla and Beth are sisters; although, they are as different as night and day. At the begging and insistence of Beth, Layla finds herself in the very front row of the Ozstryker Band concert. Layla has no idea who this band is, but for sure there were thousands of other girls like her sister who loved them confirmed by the deafening screaming while they were on stage. They were Beths absolute favorite band in the entire world. Layla could not help but notice how gorgeous the lead singer Jimmy was, but then she caught the eyes of the lead guitarist, Jax and she was mesmerized by his physical beauty. Try as she might, she could not help staring at him, but what was crazier, was that she caught him staring back at her. She is thinking, this is crazy, he would never be interested in plain old her, not when he could have any girl in the entire world. He was a rock star!!! The next thing you know, she is given backstage passes and its a whirlwind of meeting this beautiful man and the band members who knows that she is a nice girl unlike the groupies who are there for only one thing. Jax persuades her to go on a date and before you know it she is accepting the job as band photographer since the one the band had just left, and its off on the tour with the band.

He is loyal and I think that is what sparks his anger which gets him into trouble and almost loses him his job.

2492,"I enjoyed the story but I absolutely hated the ending. That said, I hate all cliffhangers so that is not anything against this book in particular. The first half of the book was mainly about Glitch and his friends Jack and Scratch. It is not until we introduce his love interest that things begin to go down hill. It was a few of pages worth of plotline and then several pages of gratuitous, explicit sex scenes. I am not a very big reader of erotica, but some of it just did not make any sense to me, my husband, or my mother for that matter. In particular, the phrase her nipples looked like honeycoated silver dollars is just plain confusing and if someone could explain it that would be outstanding. The few pages of plot and then several pages of sex repeated that way until the abrupt end of the book.

The one drawback is that each circular gear has 4 tiny prongs that must be lined up with 4 tiny holes on a base piece.

2514,"Let me start by saying I think Johnny Cash is one of the greatest American musicians bar nonea true giant of a talent who left a legacy of music that can never be surpassed.  But this album is unworthy of the greatness of the man in black.  They sound like cast off tracks from recording sessions that were never meant to see daylight.

When I spotted this album on the counter at Starbucks, I eagerly snatched it up.  I had a 90 minute car ride ahead of me from Centralia, WA to Portland, OR and this album would be just the ticket.  Oh buddy, was I wrong.  By the time I reached Portland I was depressed and sad that such woeful music could emanate from an album by such a great man.

I see all the glowing reviews here at Amazon, so obviously I am in the minority on this.  Everybody's got a right to their opinion.  Mine is that this album should never have been issued.  I will go back to the many stellar albums I have in my collection of Johnny Cash music where the music is sweet and hot and honest and everything that Johnny had to give.

If you have not heard the album, do not let me discourage you from buying it.  Get it and listen for yourself.  You might like it.  But I sure do not.",Very nice!,With All Due Respect This is Unworthy of the Man in Black

Since they do not come in 1/2 sizes they are really of no use to me. I am a true 9.5 but I can wear a 10 in almost any brand. So the 10's being on the big side are waaaaay too big.

It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be rewritten and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here is my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise not reverse mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you are screwed. 5. Read 4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing",These instructions are a must know for some dryers,A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.

2520,"This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after two years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. Those online features cost money to provide, and Intuit chooses to require repeated purchases to use them. The only sane alternative would be an annual subscription fee. I like this software a lot so I buy it every year. It would be perfectly sensible to buy it every two years instead.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. In my use, it is stable and dependable. The feature set is impressive. I would like more report types and a better life planner, but I do not find anything that comes close to what Intuit offers here.

The new version is what is shown in the video has three grooves on one end and is literally a plastic lock without a metal inside. Note that I own the older version of this product and it was a superior product and lasted me for more than 5 years. I still have two of the original six locks. Unfortunately during international travels four have been broken in transit. So I searched all over to replace them with new models and came across these. I have to tell that I have not travelled yet with the new version of these. Comparatively speaking though the new versions are extremely light and appear to be much cheaper in quality than the old version. Also, I ordered 3 of these 2 packs and of the 6 I received all were green and only 5 of the 6 were functional. So I have contacted Amazon and they are helping me exchange the defective lock. Amazon always has outstanding customer service. My only concern is that although these are a great price these easily cost $8$12 more at stores in DC, I do not think they will have the longevity of the previous Master locks I owned due to the lower quality construction.

I am very comfortable holding my yarn and keeping tension, so I was not purchasing it for those reasons.  I wanted it for learning how to knit colorwork.  I was having an awful time learning to manage two colors of yarn at the same time and someone told me that this might help me.  Unfortunately, although it keeps two strands of yarn from getting mixed up, it forced me to completely alter how I maintain my yarn tension and that just was not working out for me.  I purchased this thimble to avoid learning how to knit with both hands, but in the end that is what I had to do.

The graphics are just amazing, but its squaresoft so that is expected. It is definitely the best graphics yet on the PS2, that i have seen. The storyline is pretty good, the more i play it the more i get into it.
The reason though it only gets 3 stars from me is that there is a lack of gameplay in it. It is a lot of movies and very little fighting. And when you do fight the controls are extremely easy but the camera blows. There are quite a few times that the camera is facing you and the enemies are behind the camera, you have to stumble blindly into them at times.
If and when the game goes down in price i recommend it, but if you are looking for a fighter with a LOT of replay value get DOA2 or Tekken Tag if not just for the bowling game.",I've learned that this is a weird game,i still don't know...

When I decided to purchase another NAS device extra speed, more storage, I could not find a better product than this QNAP.  You can find CHEAPER devices from synology, or thecus, but I feel this device is one of the best.

The build quality feels excellent.  When it arrived, it feels and looks like a serious piece of IT equipment which it is.  The front panel makes it easy to setup.

I had no issues mounting my drives also purchased through amazon, and performing the setup.  There are a lot of options with the firmware of this device!

It can be setup to email or sms txt message you if there is a problem with it, it has several different built in software applications like ITUNES server, and bittorrent downloading software, and is expandable with applications you can install through the firmware separately.

It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.

They even updated the firmware for my old NAS with most of the new features of the newer ones, so they do not just abandon the old devices until technology has fully passed them by.

Highly recommend this product.",Great product for a small price,Qnap NAS is the best of the best

2592,"Several years ago, I was milling around the balcony of a small venue in Pittsburgh waiting for a concert by the dream team of Paradise Lost and Opeth to begin. Several rather menacing college students approached me, including a towering gentleman with a shaved head and goatee. Fearing they had targeted me for a random act of violence, I was relieved to find they simply wanted to know which band I was there to see. When I replied that I was almost equally eager to see both bands, I quickly found myself quickly integrated into their little group for the evening, even if I did not share their view that Paradise Lost had `sold out' when Nick Holmes abandoned his early death metal vocal style. Upon discovering my work often took me to Africa, the hulking guy at the center of the group launched into a shockingly informed soliloquy on the social and economic problems plaguing the continent. He then claimed to be the starting nose guard for Pitt's nationally ranked football team, and lamented that his teammates rarely let him blast death metal in the locker room. After quizzing me about my favorite Opeth albums and my history as a death metal fan dating back to the early 90s, he suggested that I check out Bloodbath, a side project featuring Michael Akerfeldt he was sure I would like. The concert that night lived up to my expectations, though I was dismayed to see the treatment Paradise Lost received from some of the younger Opeth fans who jeered them. Opeth fans are among the most notoriously snobby metal fans, but it was sad to see their lack of respect for Paradise Lost, one of the greatest metal bands of all time. I was happy that at least my new friends",Paradise Lost is one of the greatest metal bands ever,A Fun Death Metal Classic

2612,"Of the first three books in this series see below for listings, this is my favorite. Each of the McMurray men is strong and forceful; Teagen goes a step further with a thick layer of crustiness. Most men move out of his way rather than speak to this quiet man. The story begins in 1856 and jobs for women are sparse and hardtofind. After the death of her overbearing and drunk husband, Eli Barton, Jessica knows she must take her three children and run. Eli's mother is wealthy and wants to give a home to the 3 girls without their mother. Jessica has no family so leaving Chicago evolves to going to Whispering Mountain Ranch in Texas. Eli has been corresponding with Teagen McMurray for more than 10 years; Jessica thinks he will let her rest there for a couple of weeks as she decides what to do next. An underwhelmed Teagen escorts the widow and her girls to his ranch. Jessica softens Teagen's uneasiness by explaining that her relatives are coming from California for the 4 Bartons. As soon as Jessica arrives at the ranch, she feels that she has found home. Then the girls get started winding Teagen around their little fingers. Their antics are beyond cute; five yearold Rose does a particularly good job of showing Teagen how dull his life had been before the 3 dynamos arrived. I liked everything about this book; readers had already met some of the characters in previous books. Because of the pacing, we really get to see what influence the widow and her girls have on the gruff and forbidding Teagen. 5 stars Whispering Mountain 1. Texas Rain 2006 2. Texas Princess 2007 3.

It is fun, interesting and there is a very knowledgeable user base that can help almost anyone with anything. Plus, Corel is a great company and continues to support their customers ""Reveal codes"" is a fun little feature, but it has no real value anymore.

2656,"The Wright Brother was great introduction to the different Wright brothers, particularly, Julian.  

The plot unfolds around a man who is deaf and colorblind and an older woman who have known each other since childhood and their journey toward love, acceptance, and taking chances in life.

Their affair is not an easy one, so hence, my wanting to wring somebody is neck and slap some sense into someone every once in a while! But, when they did give into their feelings and come together it was absolutely beautiful.

I liked the depth the author had added to the Julians character, aside from his physical hindrances, and his out of the box type of way he sees himself and the world. So different and dynamic. Yet refreshing!! He totally got under my skin, that is for sure!!

As for Elisa, she waserrsomething else. Do Not get me wrong, she is a good person and her heart is in the right place. Its just her mind and demeanor that got to me at times since her actions do not exactly follow up to what I was expecting. She was really something in itself!

So all in all, a touching story about life's blessings and heartaches and how to make the best of obscure challenges and to pave way to your future!

2661,"I used to keep my firearm under the pillow next to me. Now, I do not have to. My holster holds my Glock 17 with ""Nebo ProTec Elite HP190 HighPowered Firearm Light"" [httpSkeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant/www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BNROME?psc1redirecttrueref_oh_aui_search_detailpage]. For my setup, I put the holster between my headboard and mattress, towards the middle. This would help make it so that I would have access to my weapon while making it difficult for someone standing next to my bed King mattress to get to my weapon. Also, when my bed is made or at least my pillows are stacked along the headboard, you would never know that there were a firearm there. After reading reviews, I was afraid that I would need to remove my light in order for the holster to accommodate my firearm. There must have been a design modification, because the holster is adjustable so that I was able to allow for more room towards the bottom to accommodate my light. The piece that folds over your firearm to create the holster velcros to the back, and two more flaps ensure that your setting will not slip. When I first set it up, my Nebo's switch would catch as I drew my weapon from the holster because the switch dropped below the opening on the bottom of the holster. A quick adjustment made it so that this was no longer an issue, and my weapon now sits higher in the holster. Ever where there is a lot of movement on the mattress, my weapon stays in place. Because the holster is adjustable, I am sure that this holster can accommodate many other handgun models/sizes both with and without tactical lights or lasers.

2665,"This mug is pretty good. Keeps hot drinks hot past 5 hours.  I have gotten 9 hours hot with this thing. The body it self is easy to clean. Does not get many stains. Mostly stainless steel. When you make a hot drink and screw on the lid right away it makes it hard to open the lid because the pressure bulid up. Open/close kind of lid. You can drink out of either side. Has a hook on the inside of the lid for tea bags, useful at times. 2 rubber gaskets. You have to take the lid apart to clean it. The lid has about 5 things to clean. Has a study Handel for you to hold. A bit heavy with it filled up but not to heavy. This mug will cost you about $2530 at a typical store. The thermos/ vacuum feature is better than Contigo. Do not know about cold drinks, have not tested cold drinks out fully yet. In the new model they should change the lid than I would give it a 5.
Update: got about 30 hours of cold ice water and I refilled it at least 4 times. Amazing. Go out and buy this travel mug. Drooped it a few times and still working fine. There is a new model with a new easy clean lid. Coffee is so hot at times that I cannot drink it till almost 6 hours later. If you put a few ice cubes and fill with water and forget to drink it, it will stay cold for up to 2 days. Only downside is that the seal can be a bit hard to put on at times.","This mug is pretty good. Keeps hot drinks cold past 5 hours, Does not get many scratches",Thermos Stainless King Travel Mug

I do not have any concerns about the workpiece coming loose or kickback occuring.  The only suggestion I have for Milescraft is that adjusting it needs to be made a bit easier.  My experience has been the bolt in the curved track is not the easiest to adjust.  It appears to be binding down in the aluminum slot below the plastic that fits into the miter slot of the saw.

This mount is easy to mount/unmount. Just slide it into the CD slot and turn the screw until it is secure.
Holds devices securely with foam pieces so that it will not scratch the device
Adjusts to many size devices
Can rotate 360 degrees
Does not block the view out the windshield but it also easily visible
Gives room to plug in devices for charging while mounted obviously depends on device, but the bottom bracket is removable if it gets in the way

CON:
Sometimes the mount vibrates/bounces slightly
The screw partially blocks the radio display
The mount is angled backwards which allows the sunlight coming in the windshield to reflect off my phone screen and makes it difficult to see. I can get around this by tilting my phone forward when I mount it.

2675,"I also used all 3 protectors before I was satisfied with the application.  This is not because there is something wrong with the product, but putting a screen protector is quite difficult to achieve a perfect result.  Lint and dust are always a problem.

I first cleaned the iPhone screen with an optical spray applied on a piece of cloth, and then gave several gusts of air from a compressed gas duster.  I was able to align the protector almost perfectly but I got several bubbles.  I repeated the process and almost got it the next time.  On the third attempt, I was satisfied after pushing the bubbles to the side.  Pushing the bubbles with the cardboard only works if there is no speck of dust or lint under the screen.

The matte screen really helps with the glare; it is also less susceptible to fingerprints.  When my kids play with grease on their hands, I just wipe it off and cleans easily.

What you get:
3 matte/antiglare screen protectors, small cloth, and a small piece of cardboard to push the bubbles out. Instruction is at the back.

At the time of the review, the total damage to my pocket is only seventythree cents including shipping which is an excellent value.

Made in China",Not perfect,Excellent value.  Works great.
2676,"This is a weird pencil. It comes with 6 pieces of HB lead, which is honestly a bit too much. It is most likely Pentel's Super HiPolymer lead, which is a nice overall lead that is really easy to get a hold of. A bit scratchy to write with though. The plastic is nice and hard, but feels to be pretty brittle. Try not to drop it on anything hard, even through the plastic is fairly thick. It is a couple grams heavier than you would expect from a plastic pencil, but it is still light and nicely balanced. The balance point is directly on the lead indicator, making a standard grip natural. The lead sleeve is centered and hard, but it is not retractable. I would carry this pencil in a sleeve if you do not want to damage it while carrying it in a pocket. The clip is not very special, but it does the job well. It is spring steel, and likely will not break. I have not tried removing it, but you probably could if you do not like it. There is a lead indicator that I like a lot, because it is octagonal inside, which means you can put it on 8 lead grades and it will not rotate until you lift it off of the barrel. This makes it perfect every time, which is a very nice and clever touch that other pencils lack. What Is also very nice is that the standard HB lead grade is positioned on the front of the pencil where the logo is, 90 degrees from the clip. Again, a very nice touch that I wish were on pencils that do this. Now, the plunger the part you press down is one of the most interesting I have used.",Great but still a good value for money,"An Interesting Pencil Worth Checking Out, but Has Some Issues"

2680,"First I did not know what to expect with Schoenberg. I hated the Debussy opera of Pelleas and Melisande and was concerned we would get 12 tone music....yet I remembered his fabulous Transfigured Night.....one of the most gorgeous tone poems ever. Rest assured he was in his romantic phase and this tone poem has some beautiful moments. What is unusual is the introduction with art and subtitling so we knew what was on Schoenberg's mind passage by passage. Now this would be a wonderful feature on many classical performances.

What I could not understand was why was no one over the age of 25 performing in this DVD. You see I had been watching all the Lucerne Mahler symphonies. Well this is a jaw dropping talented youth orchestra....and they smile when they play. Their music is yes....youthful and fresh....and how appropriate given the solo piece a child's view of Heaven compared to Earth. Well that is my view......and it did bring out my child.

2685,"...maybe.  This, the first album from the reformed Little Feat, is a much looser, funkier album than ""Sailin' Shoes"" or their debut.  This is attributed to the inclusion of bassist Kenny Gradney, guitarist Paul  Barrere and precussionist Sam Clayton and their musical mixing input.  ""Dixie Chicken"" is a watershed album and the title track  ""Two Trains"" and ""Fat Man in the Bathtub"" are brillaint  tunes.  But the album is much more than just those three songs.  ""Walkin' All Night,"" ""Roll Um Easy"" and ""On Your  Way Down"" are just as good although I think ""Juliette"" is  kind of a dud.  What makes this album a winner, though, is the direction  it pointed the group in.  Never again would they be considered the  nonsouthern southern rock band.

Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mother's inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy.

Also, there were not as many locations to investigate as some other ND games.  In particular, there is very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses.

2734,"With this album we are definately dealing with one of those ""what more can one say"" sort of situations when it comes to reviewing it,mainly because of it is acclaim for listeners outside the jazz sphere. But whatever it ended up being this is Miles and jazz at some of it is very finest. One of the greatest things about it is that it definately leaves creative impressions on you. Considering all the great musicianship that went into the creation of music such as the best known tunes on this album ""So What"" and ""All Blues"" alone and THAN actually get captured into the spirit of these song's modalities sounding so free and effortless.....your definately inspired to express yourself in some way. I am a painter who listens to music while I paint. The range I listen to is very diverse but when I am in the middle of a rendering that is particularly interesting I find myself drawn heavily towards listening to jazz and funk because,despite the division lines some people choose to put between them both styles of music over a free wheeling yet technically demanding style of music that is very fluid in tempo and rhythm. This being the beginning of modal jazz,where the harmonies and melodies were less structured that liquid quality that Jimmy Cobb,Paul Chambers and in particular those dramatic chord blocks of Bill Evans really do bring out the artist in you whatever the style of it happens to be. ""Freddie Freeloader"" is particularly interesting in that the song not only has more of an uptempo flavor of the song but it gives the opportunity for 'Trane and Cannonball to let loose on their saxes.

2747,"I bought this on the recommendation of a few people on bladeforums, and I am fairly glad I did. Before this, I would used a DuPont dry wax lubricant spray. While they seem almost identical in effect, it is the difference in application methods that makes this a better choice for small hand tools. It takes but a teensy drop on a pivot to effectively lubricate it, whereas dry wax sprays tend to spray out far too much and the excess wasted! needs to be cleaned off.

Much like the dry wax spray I was using before, this applies wet and dries as a film. I have used it with nylon washers, phosphor bronze washers, and ball bearings  all with perfectly satisfactory results. It is not superior to the dry wax lubricant spray I was using  just much more precise in application with no noticeable loss in effectiveness.

I have used this to lubricate about a dozen knives since I have purchased it, and have barely used any of the 1/2oz in the bottle. It is a surprisingly good value. Strongly recommended.",Excellent product,"Tiny, economical, effective."

I have created a few of them...and they are divine. This is the  type of cookbook that you want on a nice little shelf in the kitchen.

This is a vegetarian recipe book, but the nearly all of the recipes can be made vegan with little effort. There are a few recipes that use soya products, but it is limited.

This book does have slight reference to Buddhism, but it is not aimed exclusively at Buddhists. It is more of an vegetarian cookbook than a religious book, the main connection is purely that the food is Asian.

2782,"For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 Family Edition is bargain priced. First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security. It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0. But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year. If you want more features like Tuneup, Backup, or Online Backup, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009. It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription. I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.

Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy. 12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.

2785,"Almost all fictional films about animals have either cuteness or unreality or both. Documentaries are often engrossing, but always in the third personwe watch as the outside, disinterested observer.
This amazing film provides an almost unbelievable window into the lives of the two bears, from their perspective, with but or two false steps. There are many small, nondramatic moments that cumulatively fill the canvas. The attention to detail is extraordinary.
With hardly any dialogue, only the spare speech of the hunters, the film yet moves forward, sometimes dramatically, more often over over a small moment. In many instances we do not see the entire animal or person, but only enough so that the essence of whatever is occurring is so clear and immediate. The film makers' framing, shot selection, and editing is so completely convincing.
With awe inspiring scenery that takes away the breath and pangs over missing the deeply felt emotion that backcountry beauty has provided me and a view of animals being animals in nature.
Yes, there is some sentimentality. But it is little compared to most other fictional films, and I no longer think of animals in the wilderness as I did before.

The Archer has a wide array of tones and its controls have very subtle adjustments.  It plays from a totally clear boost, to a bit of edge to a lovely OD'ed sound; and the tone control is very effective at dialling in the exact amount of treble/bass you need.  The Archer also works great in combination with a stacked OD/distortion/fuzz pedal I use an FullTone OCD and/or a MXR MiniFuzz Face.  With gain turned down, The Archer will definitely emphasise the sound of the said dirt pedals w/o the mushiness you sometimes experience.  Compared to the SoulFood, it has less overall gain when turned to the max, BUT definitely has a better sounding, more organic and more natural sound.  That justifies the price difference IMHO.

2811,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

2847,"I grew up in Nebraska and return to the Sandhills whenever I can. Unlike nearly every other part of the US, this area is not crossed by an interstate highway, and the resulting isolation allows you to feel a little of the vast distances that used to be the West. To experience these rolling hills of grass, with not a tree in sight, especially in stormy weather, is to feel yourself totally absorbed in a great sweep of landscape  a living carpet of flora and mostly unseen fauna. Jones' book does much to recreate that experience in words. And he deepens the experience with his knowledge of geology and history, explaining how the Sandhills came into existence and in more recent times became peopled by the Plains Indians, cattle ranchers, and homesteaders.

Jones is especially knowledgeable about the birds that inhabit the Sandhills  noting those that are longtime residents and those that have been introduced over time with the changing ecology. It is amazing, as I have heard it myself, to hear a chorus of birds from every direction, all hidden by the grass and not a tree in sight. He also provides an accounting of the whitetail deer and pronghorn that range across this land, undeterred by barb wire fences. His stories of the Indians, the Pawnee, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Ponca are respectful and poignant. He also takes time to visit the grave of writer Mari Sandoz and to describe her life as the daughter of a Panhandle homesteader. This is a fine collection of essays for anyone who enjoys good nature writing. Readers may also enjoy Ian Frazier's ""Great Plains.""",Great Sandhills,Leaves of grass . . .

""This eyeliner went on very smoothly and did not pull at my eyes. I got a nice smooth line that was also very easy to smudge out for a smokey look. I forgot that I had it on and I was not tempted to rub or poke at my eyes even by the end of the day. It does last all day, still nice and dark late at night, but it was easy to remove with a little eye cream.

2868,"Top notes: tea and citrus middle notes: spices base notes: musk and sandalwood Scent: I was worried this was going to be just another cologne composed of citrus/spices/musk. That is a proven and easytolike scent profile so proven and likable that it is become common. Amen is actually something more a subtle scent where the tea tempers the brightness of the citrus up top and the spices and sandalwood provide an almost woody dryness underneath. The notes are very wellblended; no one note predominates. Amen definitely has a personality a sophisticated, softspoken one. While marketed to men, this cologne could work for the right woman. Performance: Amen has surprising longevity. I could still faintly smell this on my wrist six hours after spraying, which is very good for a soft fragrance. The downside is the projection, which is almost nonexistent after the first hour. According to philosophy, this is not a bug but a feature. Amen is being marketed as an antiAxe Spray not so much a fragrance as a kind of alternative to fragrance. People who get close to you will not think, ""Ah, philosophy's Amen sure smells good"" instead, they will think, ""Ah, [YOUR NAME HERE] sure smells good."" In short, this cologne is for the guy who likes the clean, closetotheskin smell of fine soap but wants it to last most of the day instead of an hour. Price: While Amen is not topoftheline expensive, it is not exactly inexpensive, either. Make sure to compare colognes by costperounce. I have a 2oz. bottle of Amen that pricesout at around the same cost as some 3oz. and 4oz. bottles of other colognes. I do not think Amen is too expensive given the quality of the scent, but your mileage might vary. Summary: Amen is a spicy, sophisticated scent",A Must-have,"Sophisticated scent, soft projection"

Yes its is made of plastic but is more sturdy than some would lead you to believe and it works just as advertised. No you do not want to let a 4 ton elephant stand on it but let us be adults here. I did not write a review until now because now I have a reason to give them 5 stars. I was using it on a windows 7 PC with no problems but was forced to purchase a new laptop and of course it has the dreaded Windows 8. Not a fan and yes I have been working with computers and IT for 25 years. This pc did not have bluetooth on it so I had to use the dongle that came with it and I have the V4 newest version of the pedal. Windows 8 sees it as a keyboard so immediately asks for a pairing code to be typed in, kind of hard with it being a pedal and all. I sent an email to PageFlip Support asking if it worked with Win8 and was pleasantly surprised when not only did I receive a reply in less than 24 hours but was also informed that Yes it will work with Windows 8 and a new dongle based on bluetooth 3.0 was being sent to me FREE of charge. Two days later it arrives and works like a champ. I found it very refreshing that a company these days not only stands behind their product as Windows changes every other week but sent me the corrective HARDWARE free of charge to fix it.

The soft formula has very little fallout, and blends well. Even the amount of shimmer is spot on, giving dimension without age emphasizing shine.
However, it sadly lacks in the pigment department. It took awhile to build up to a more color true eye look. Even over primer, it was sheer. Now if you like sheer, and want something that takes little effort, this is your quad. If you are more on the cutting edge and want to be able to place the color you might need to look at a different color collection.

2898,"A reissue of an earlier release by the Billboardcharting New Age duo 2002, this CD, like their new album Damayanti, is a wondrous collection of some of the most breathtaking, exquisitely beautiful music ever recorded. Husbandandwife Randy and Pamela Copus have hit on a winning formula, combining Randy's guitars and Pamela's flute and harp along with keyboards and synthesizers to create a hypnotic sound that mesmerizes and enthralls. It is no wonder that they consistently chart on Billboard they have clearly connected with their audience by continually delivering pleasing melodies and luxurious arrangements. Having recently reviewed Damayanti and now Deep Still Blue, I have noticed that 2002 has developed a consistent style that comprises deliberate, measured pacing. I have not heard a 2002 song so far that is faster than midtempo. Each track takes its time, unfolding at its own leisure, allowing the listener to bask in all of its rich sonic intricacies. This is a refreshing change of pace from most albums of any genre, where tunes careen from one style to another, sometimes to jarring effect. Instead, 2002 stays true to its particular style or theme and is all the more successful for it. This consistency of methodology is a major reason why Randy Copus is quickly becoming my favorite, strictlyNew Age guitarist. Rather than a flashy display of virtuosity, his lead and rhythmguitar playing is as deliberate and measured as the expansive songs themselves. Each note he picks delivers precise and maximum impact, and his chords are as comforting as floating clouds. This is masterful technique in itself. The full effect of Randy's approach can be heard on such stunning tracks as ""An Ocean Apart,"" ""Little Angel,"" and ""The Voyage Home."" Pamela Copus is equally impressive in her subtle flute and harp playing. I am not a",Top 5 Album in history,The RajMan Review

2913,"I realize that comparisons of Lacuna Coil's latest album Karmacode to their last album, Comalies, are wearing thin, but it is a little inevitable considering that that was their breakthrough album although I am sure there are plenty of people that have never heard of them. All the elements of what makes this Italian hard rock band good are still evident.

But there are not as many standout songs this time around and the band's cover of Depeche Mode's ""Enjoy the Silence"" does not help or hurt the album. Also, I agree with reviewer Marty Ogilvie when he said that lead female singer Cristina Scabbia's vocals are clouded by the production sometimes, particularly in the first four songs yes, even ""Our Truth"". But there are still aboveaverage songs like ""In Visible Light"" and ""Without Fear"".

In short, casual listeners will probably just see Karmacode as any other hard rock album. It is far from being a bad album, but I think only serious fans of Lacuna Coil will be able to appreciate it.

2916,"This machine really does work to make your skin look brighter, smoother, and evens out tone.  I was on the verge of switching my moisturizing routine because my skin was looking dull.  After trying this machine, I realized I did not need to switch.  It is very easy to use.  Make sure you watch the instructional video first.  There are two heads, a small round one and a larger oblong one.  The smaller head is for areas you want to treat more delicately.  It comes with filters, which you must change out after each use.  I plan on using this only a few times per year but I think the instructions say that you can use this a couple times per week.  Personally, I would not use it any more often than once per week.

When I do a treatment, I wash my face first I use Olay Daily Facials, dry my face, then use the machine.  After a treatment, my skin does look a little reddish and irritated.  The process is not really painful but there is a bit of mild discomfort.  I apply my nighttime moisturizer Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream and go to bed.  In the morning, my skin looks much brighter and clearer than before.

It comes in a nice box with instructional book, a DVD, two heads, two packages of filters, and wall electric plug.  I would like to note that while running, it does make a bit of noise, so I would not try to use it if someone is trying to sleep nearby.","It works, but I would not use it any more frequently than once per week","I get brighter, clearer skin"

2924,"Make no mistake about it, Akira Yamaoka redefined what a videogame soundtrack could be  ranging from deep dark ambient sounds to Portishead inspired electro rock and heavy metal. Toss in a few mournful ballads along with some melancholic piano pieces and you have got versatile dark perfection. The innovations of Silent Hill 1 were largely improved on with the PS2 sequel. Better graphics along with an overall better sound design. In itself, Akira's music stands alone and can be listened to without actually being a fan of the videogame franchise. However, to fully appreciate the man's work one must experience the whole package. Akira handled everything when it came to the sound design for the now legendary Silent Hill series. He even designed a hundred or so different foot step sounds. And although the overall quality of the videogame series has diminished in recent years, Akira's soundtracks are always something to look forward to with each consecutive release.

2926,"I am a former owner of pretty much every iPod out there, except a few never had a mini, and never bothered with the firstgen nano and it is scratches. I have owned the 8GB iPod Touch, and the 16GB iPod Touch, and I can attest that this new model with 32GB is technically not very different from the other models. However, it does benefit from being produced later in the iPod Touch's life, and therefore does not have some of the problems that hit me as an early adopter of the other two versions, like the infamous ""negative blacks"" issue. Nope, with this model, all the problems have been addressed, and what you get is the iPod Touch the way it was meant to be. For me, the 32GB was a must. The 8GB was too small for me. How can you have such a great screen and such a limited capacity to store movies? The 16GB was better, but I was still finding myself shifting songs around in various smart playlists in order to fit my 30GB music library on the iPod Touch along with my bookmarks, contacts, calendars, photos, and a few television shows and movies. It was always a struggle to make it all fit. Finally, the introduction of a 32GB model has solved all my problems. I can fit ALL my bookmarks, calendars, photos, television shows, podcasts, audiobooks, and quite a few movies on the 32GB iPod Touch, and I still have enough room for most of my music and some music videos.

2941,"I am loving this phone way too much to give a completely objective review. But I can tell you something.

  The black of the screen is so dark that you almost cannot distinguish it from the bezel! Its awesome! On a more technical term, the black part of the screen literally does not consume any power, and as windows phone has more black than any other color in its UI, the battery life gets a significant boost from it.
  LTE is awesome. My LTE speed is almost as much as I get in my home by WiFi! YouTube in HQ!
  The frontfacing camera is amazing. If video chat has any preference at all, this is the phone to get. I am comparing to HTC Titan.
  The build quality! If anyone is not familiar with Nokia's build quality, they can buy this phone eyes closed. Easily the best built phone in market. It lives up to Nokia's standard easily.
  The phone feels really superior to hold. The side of the phone is rounded, not boxy or edgy, so its really easy to hold. And the texture of the polycarbonate body makes thing even sweeter.
  Fantastic call quality. Nokia held up to their reputation in call quality. The positioning of the external speaker allows you to listen to music or talk on speakerphone regardless of which side of the phone is facing up.

If you are buying this under contract, I challenge anyone to find a better deal than this phone at under $100/$50. This is not a flawless phone, but if you look at the price, it blows all other phones out of the water.

BUY THIS PHONE.",Very good phone,The Phone to get.

2947,"Deutsche Gramophpn hit a winner with this rerelease of a 1982 recording featuring Katia Ricciarelli singing Aida and Placido Domingo singing Radames. From the smooth opening prelude by the Cora e Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala, under the direction of Claudio Abbado to the final Gloria all'Egitto, the cast and orchestra strike a prefect balance between voice and instrument in a performance that is spellbinding. It takes no time to warm up here, and the welcome is rich, indeed, as Placido Domingo eases us into the passion of Rademes early on in a truly spectacular Se Quel guerrier io fossi! The singing here from the entire cast is even and easy, and the delivery is balanced. Each singer is comfortably within his and her range and matched in temperament, and this matching is evident from song to song, and none more so than the trio Terzetto: Vieni, o diletta, apressati, sung by Elena Obraztsova Amneris, Ricciarelli and Domingo. The tendancy to ""shout"" one's role can be a killer for singers and this reviewer has commented on that tendency in the past. There is none of that here, which is why this CD comes so strongly recommended. The quality of the CD remaster is superb and the accompanying booklet, while not as complete as I would have preferred  no introduction, no bios, no historical facts  is adequate as far as it describes what is occurring during each song.","remastered with the ability to ""shout"" one'n role",Domingo's Radames is worth the price of admission.

Kind of like my CPAP machine, it takes some getting used to and then you try sleeping without it and you realize it is really helping.  I bought this 2nd one on amazon because the price was right.  My boyfriend had neck pain and I let him use my pillow for the night. He liked it so now we each have one but I got the new one!

2960,"This is a good disc. But I have to say that Rudy Van Gelder missed the boat on the mix and mastering. Shirley Scott's playing was great, but his Hammond organ overpowers the saxophones on several of the cuts as does George Duvivier's excellent bass. Arthur Edgehill's drumming was not quite up to the playing of the others. He stumbled in a couple of cuts. It is very strange that a session touting these excellent tenor players would push their sound back and have the organ  bass more forward and prominent. Sure, they are dropped back when the saxes play, but even then both come through bright and crisp while the saxophones sound almostdull!

The playing is great. It is obvious that everyone was having a great and relaxed time. No oneupmanship. No frantic displays of hyper technique. Just a good solid blowing session with pretty good solos and support. They meshed well. Up tempo and fun. This is a very good disc, but not a great one.",Great Bass,Swingin' but Flawed

The graphic and gory details in the opening of human prey being stalked by Shade; then Vayle appearance and him killing that girl so they could eat her, just grossed me out.  The descriptions of them, but especially Shade relishing what she was doing and lamenting because there was not more were sickening.

2977,"REVIEW

 25 DAYS  before Christmas.  This book is a rendition through puns based on themes having to do with Christmas.  Some are not so good like the green pig says, ""My 'Sow'vation!"" Most young people will have a lot of laughter from the silliness of the puns with the captions to match.

The pictures are bright a filled with color.  Surrounded by text.  Lily is a cute little blondheaded girl and most of  the scenes of Christmas, from the Nativity to Santa and the Christmas tree and gift stockings hanging on the mantle.  A silly book of puns that children will laugh and laugh.  This is a book that will entertain and educate all in one.

I received a complimentary copy of Christmas Lilly from the author Kathy Johnson for my view of the book.  No other compensation took place.

I would give this book 4 STARS.",Very fun and entertaining,A STARLETTE CHRISTMAS

3020,"This may be the best book on the subject of Marilyn's Monroe's murder.
Most of the riveting information hinges on two witnesses a handyman,and an ambulance driver.
The coverup was wellorchestrated and started very early.  A lot of the revelations in this book were known previously. The involvement on some level of Robert Kennedy and Peter Lawford, the missing diary, wiretaps being some examples.

One of the issues that I found real interesting was the incomplete autopsy and what Dr. Noguchi had to say about the whole process. That kind of coverup has to be organized and directed by folks with a lot of power. The same can be said for the amount of people on the scene immediately after Marilyn's Monroe death. I do not recall ever reading so much detailed information about who was on the scene and when.

Another interesting item was the duration of the relationship between JFK and Marilyn Monroe. It appears to have a longer history than what I thought. The indiscretions went beyond the Kennedy Brothers' affairs to sharing sensitive information at a time when Hoover and Hoffa were using wiretaps to prove that the brothers were having affairs.

An interesting parallel I found with another book I recently read is the same law enforcement officials. These guys popped up in Jacque Daniel's book ""The Curse Of The Black Dahlia"".
What I like the best about this book is that it investigates the close circle that surrounded Miss Monroe. The connections they had to each other and the enemies that found a common target in the movie star for various reasons. Her murder was very much like Marilyn's lifetragic.

3037,"First of all, I only have the one compact disc collection. There are two choices either one compact disc or both which features Erotica. Sadly, I do not have that one with two discs. There are might be other songs in the 2 disc collection than this one. Actually, my sister bought this collection disc. If I had a choice, I would have gotten the two disc collection.

I found it interesting that this collection does not feature Madonna's racy song, ""Erotica,"" in the mix of her greatest hits. Maybe Celebration was not supposed to be her greatest hits compilation but I think Erotica should be on this collection because it was one of her best hits. She always broke ground with songs like ""Like a Virgin,"" ""Like a Prayer,"" Papa Do not Preach, and of course, ""Erotica."" The other songs are on this compilation but not Erotica. Madonna has always pushed buttons, issues, and sexuality to the forefront of world culture. Erotica and the video was quite racy, daring, and even breaking new ground. As Madonna has matured in the years, she has moved away from the groundbreaking that she did early in her career but she still sings the hits that made her famous, wealthy, and admired by millions. No matter how many female performers will imitate and copy her, there is only one Madonna.","Madonna's racy song ""Erotica"" was at the forefront of world culture and has just done it.",Missing Erotica on the 1 CD collection!
3038,"Executive Summary: Great little machine and functionally very similar to the Brother CS6000i. These machines are about perfect for learning and hobbyist level use. Also, it is almost a sin to waste time and money by paying someone to hem a pair of pants. Much faster and cheaper to buy an inexpensive sewing machine and learn to do it. Unlike other reviewers, if both were the same price then I would take the CS6000i over the CE7070PRW. I value the CS6000i's included cover not a carry case more than the additional 10 stitched of the CE7070PRW. Also, the CS6000i seems to have a few more metal parts in places where metal may be important spindle, .... I have owned and used the CS6000i for about a year now. Great little machine.

Hence I was running a few test swatches through it almost immediately. It simply works. Just like it is supposed to. On the other hand, I almost exclusively us straight, zigzag, and blind stitches. It is simply amazing what Brother packs into these little machines. It is also amazing how many little attachments are included. Especially all the different feet for different kinds of stitches. I know a fair number of people that turn their noses up at these sewing machines. They like to spend a few hundreds of dollars or more on other brands. After hemming a bunch of pants and numerous jedi robe designs, I cannot tell the difference. One of the odd things about these machines is that they are very light.

The quality of the card stock for the player mats and cards is the thinnest I have seen. The box is flimsy too. If this was a $2030 game the components would be okay expect the chipped cubes. I paid nearly $55 at the time of purchase. I contacted Stronghold games to try to get replacement cubes. I had planned to keep the game because of the excellent reviews and BGG ranking. This was their response: ""Tim, Thank you for your email. We are sorry about your disappointment with the cubes. We do take all of these concerns very seriously. The manufacturing process for these cubes, which is a double layered plastic injection mold, is very complex. This process causes some chipping on these cubes, especially around the point where the cubes are ejected from from the cube mold, but also in other places as well. This is unavoidable in this very new and complex process that we are using, which are likely the first in the industry to execute production of metallic bonded plastic cubes. We apologize for any disappointment you have with these cubes, but we cannot replace them. The game play, of course, is fantastic, and Terraforming Mars has already received many accolades already including Top 10 game of all time on Board Game Geek, Dice Tower Award for ""Strategy Game Of The Year"", Meeples Choice Award for ""Game Of The Year"", Kenner Spiel Des Jahres nomination for ""Gamer's Game of the Year"".

3069,"This is not your grandmother's old Rishi Kapoor or Hema Malini movie, where kissing was taboo, and romance was limited to making googoo eyes and performing elaborately choreographed dances in the mountains. By Hollywood standards, this is an intriguing movie, where two women rebel against their traditional roles, and turn to each other for love, respect and sexual gratification. By Bollywood standards however, this shocker has committed several major offenses, the least of which are the onscreen love scenes between two women. The issues that shocked the traditionalists to the bone are that firstly, the women are Hindus, secondly the movie challenges the very core of male dominance, and thirdly, that women have the right to be independent and happy in their marital relationships. Radha Shabana Azmi is married to Ashok Kulbhushan Kharbanda and has been unable to fulfill his desire for a child. Ashok has been consulting a Swami, and in the belief that desire is the root of all evil, keeps her close to him without intimacy so that he will become a better person. Sita Nandita Das is a young bride with a longing for love and adventure, married to Jatin Javed Jaffrey who is unwilling to provide her with either, because he is in love with someone else. Their marriage is a sham, as Jatin only married to please Ashok and his grandmother Biji. As per custom, the whole extended family lives under one roof, and their unhappy marriages draw Sita and Radha together. Sita turns out to be the one who inspires the break with tradition, and finds a willing convert in Radha. Director Deepa Mehta handles this controversial movie tastefully and tenderly, the romance balanced by traditional family values and the comedic activities of the servant Mundu Ranjit Chowdhry, a Mehta regular.

Not due to lack of a decent story line but mafia books are not my thing. I have eagerly awaited a new release since I adore Ms. Mynx's writing style a great deal. When she is in a groove a hot tale will be told! Do not Leave Me This Way left me flabbergasted and not in a good way. Let me explain why... I am all for authors expanding their horizons and stepping outside of their writing comfort zone. It is the only way they can hone their craft however, BDSM is not Ms. Mynx's storytelling strength. I was aware of the subject matter ahead of time and my interest was piqued. I was intrigued and excited to see how Ms. Mynx would tackle a topic I adore. I also know authors write the tales they wish to be told but for me, her authentic voice was lost. The voice that is always present in a Sienna Mynx novel was fleeting in this book. Crispin and Keturah's story did not capture me and I believe it was partially due to the BDSM element. I struggled with the beginning of the story due to the fact that I was only 6 in but the amount of grammatical errors was shocking. Ridiculous errors!

It came with a very long code printed on the sleeve of the DVD it came with but every time I tried to enter it in the program it kept telling me the code was invalid! Only after searching Corel's support website did I find a document dedicated just to this since it must confound quite a number of their customers. The problem was they print their V's right up next to each other so what I kept typing in was a W instead of 2 V's!!! Only good thing about that is that I found out the DVD contains both the 32bit and 64bit version of the program. I am glad I got it all straightened out because this really is a fun program to use. If you ever used Photoshop Elements or Lightroom a lot of things will look familiar and work similarly to those programs. For example, it opens up to a manage tab where you can see all your photographs as thumbnails and manage them by rating them or creating you own smart collections. It automatically creates collections from photos in your pictures folder based on date, tags, people, places and ratings. Then there is the adjust tab that let us you apply instant effects like artistic pencil, charcoal, black and white 10 different versions, retro several versions also, portrait that includes vignette, soft focus, infrared, smart photo fix, soft focus 1 and 2, skin smoothing, and various others.

The score has been sweetened using the most up to date equipment and made to engulf you in the atmospher. The movie flows so well, makes so much more sense.

SPOILER ALERT:  It is so clear that Deckard is conceived a replicant from the getgo, just like the book its based on. This fact puts every scene in context and clearly shows that Roy Batty Rutger Hauer is the real hero of the film.

I saw the movie two times this month October 2007 digitally projected at the LA Landmark Theater and it was stunning and flowed beautifully. And the ending is so right on now.

3104,"I was originally deterred from buying this gem because of all the ""Nightwish fell off"" comments being posted on this website, but thanks to the harsh criticism dealt out by many ""fans"" on here, it astonished me and I would easily label it Nightwish's best effort to date. So Tarja is not using the opera pitch the entire time. THAT IS A GOOD THING!!! She is got a quite lovely voice, but all too often it went against the direction of the music, or was just way too overdone. This time around, it is not so intrusive, and while there are a few parts that signal that her opera days have scraped all the power out of her throat, the vocals fit the music much better, and she can still hit the high notes flawlessly most of the time. However, Sinergy's Marco Hietala Sinergy and Nightwish just do not seem to mix; Nightwish has too much character was a BAD idea on vocals. He is worse than Timo Kotipelto. Fortunately, he does not get much mic time. For some reason, Nightwish has never had much luck with male vocals. What is it about this album that makes it better than previous releases? Well, if you have read through my reviews, I have made it clear that I do not care for Wishmaster at all. It is too commercialsounding and there is not enough variation between the songs. I think this one took many fans by surprise, as there is much more synthesizer use and the guitar does not stand out as much. But Emppu was really never a major force behind the band, and I think Jukka's drumming stands out more than anything instrumentally. Being a sucker for good drummers, this pleased me very much.

I find it absolutely ideal especially at tax time every April when I have to remember everything I did over the past 12 months to make sure I file correctly by the way I also use Turbo Tax which is phenomenal!  Like all software of this type, expect that you will have data entry and plan on an initial 5 to 8 hrs to get all your stuff setup.

3116,"Just in time for their induction into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame comes this new Blondie collection that showcases some of the band's most popular, influential songs, material from their recent releases and a mashup with one of the bands that influenced them. ""Sound Vision,"" like most Best Of sets is both a good introduction to the band's music and a wellassembled collection for the casual listener who likes Blondie, but enough to purchase every album. There is no doubt that Debbie Harry and the gang not only produced good music, but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like Shirley Manson, Gwen Stefani and yes, Madonna. Befire Princess Diana ever graced magazine covers, Harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real Punk at heart, posing at times with such figures as Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop eventhough at one point Patti Smith told her to ""get the fk out of rock n' roll"". ""Sound And Vision"" nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70's through mid80's. A lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like ""Call Me"" with it is roaring chorus and electro sheen while ""Heart Of Glass"" is still a classic jam, disco has died and yet this song remains. ""Rapture"" is still a long, dreamy anthem that brought hiphop to a wider audience before Aerosmith and Run DMC ever broke the barrier of rock and rap. Newer material is also present here, ""Maria"" was a single off the band's 1999 album ""No Exit,"" but it still has that classic Blondie sound. However I do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song ""Good Boys"" off their latest",Blondie Love,Classic Cuts And New Sounds.
3117,"Thrive came out in 2002 and can be compared to the 2003 album, Adoration.  Following the success with Shine the Hits, Thrive sets up the new phase of music that the newsboys are in.  Thrive is also the basis for the DVD concert they filmed Live at the Music Hall of Fame.  They still do most of these songs in their Adoration Tour 2004.
Thrive contains new songs including the excellent upbeat rockers Giving it Over, Live in Stereo, Rescue and Cornelius.
Fad of the land is also a rocker, and I have read that it was written for radio play, speaking to giving in to Fad.
Lord is a beautiful song.
Million Pieces is a upbeat song, in fact in concert they dumped a million pieces of brightly colored confetti on the audience during the song.. great fun!
It is You is a beautiful  awesome song that they use as the concert closer.  They do a live version of this song on their 2003 release Adoration.
If you love the newsboys, I would buy Thrive first.  Thrive is more studio.  Adoration is more for those who looking for a concert feel, plus Adoration has He Reigns and you are my king Amazing Love two of their best songs.",Great for the newsboys,The album that drives the next Phase of the Newsboys.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

3129,"I do not know how well EAARTH: MAKING A LIFE ON A TOUGH NEW PLANET is selling but as I write this, not even forty reviews precede mine. Seeing some of those reviews awarding only one or two stars and noticing EAARTH is not creating that much word of mouth, what I do know is when it comes to something they do not want to hear, too many people either deny it or do not want to talk about it. Author Bill McKibben is not the first to call us out on what is happened to the world's climate, but EAARTH does as good a job laying out the facts as any I have seen. I hope the success of the documentary film AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH was not the only time such a message reached the public, as EAARTH reminds us of how bad the enviroment's become but also educates us on how to make the most of what will be. In 1970 we had the first Earth Day. By the end of that decade, a United States president had solar panels installed in the White House and addressed the nation on the urgency of energy conservation, EAARTH recalls. Unfortunately for Jimmy Carter and the rest of the world, big oil and other moneyed interests hoodwinked the American electorate into changing presidents in 1980. No wonder author McKibben remembers drinking himself senseless after learning Ronald Reagan with whom he had traveled on the '80 campaign trail and interviewed as a college journalist won the presidency. Taking office in 1981, Mr. Reagan had Mr. Carter's solar panels removed. EAARTH confirms that it is too late to reverse the damage pollution's done. All we can do now is stop making it worse.

The set comes with a variety of sizes that are easy to interchange to fit your ear.  The sound is full and most importantly it does cancel out any noise when there is sound coming out.  Whether that be from music or a movie.

One important note is that there is no noise cancelling setting, so you have to have music or some other sound playing to get that out of them.  Not a huge issue for me, but some like to just switch it on and sleep.

Comparing to our projection TV, which we paid like $3,000 about 15 year ago, this LED TV is incredibly thin, light weight, clear, sharp, and energy efficient. With Amazon's great deal and low price guarantee, it is also an incredible value too. I feel that even if you do not watch TV much, it still worths the while to jump into the technology bandwagon and experience the changes in the high tech world if you are an old timer. After I bought the TV, I bought a LG blueray 3D player, and a few 3D blueray DVDs. This TV has a 2D to 3D conversion. Basically, you can see anything in 3D, all the TV programs and all DVD movies. You can also adjust the depth of the 3D effects. Of course, if you want to view in 3D, you may want to adjust the depth to the greatest possible. The difference between the 3D DVDs and the ordinary blueray DVDs in 3D conversion is that the images in the 3D DVDs can come out of the TV screen. Whereas, the 3D converted images from 2D can only increase in depth into the TV. However, the few 3D DVD movies I bought, although they have the highest rating at Amazon, have only a few seconds each with images popping of the TV, but cost much more than the ordinary DVDs. The 3D of this TV is the passive system. The pro is the lightweight nonexpensive veiwing glasses. The con is that the resolution is cut in half.

He was one of the great ""tough guys"" of all time on film, but dancing was his passion, he noted. It shows here.

Cohan, the writer and Broadway star of many, many hit plays and hit songs. Unlike today's biographies, this is a very positive story about a man who brought patriotism alive during World War I with such inspirational songs as ""It is A Grand Old Flag"" and ""Over There."" For some of us, listening to these songs can bring a tear or two. Cagney is his normal riveting self and Joan Leslie certainly makes an appealing female lead as Cohan's wife. The great Walter Huston plays Cohan's father. I have always found Huston to be an actor of great presence. In this movie is a very, very touching deathbed scene with he and Cagney.

3185,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

I believe my wife could have installed it. The instructions were clear and easy to read.

Wow I loved this book. It was crazy sweet and had me laughing out loud at all the character antics. This is the first Lauren Layne book I have read where I realized that the main characters actually spend most of the story apart, or at least it seems that way when reading the novel. I usually do not like that. However, in Someone Like You, I could not have appreciated it more because Layne gave us two damaged characters who really needed to work on themselves before they could ever be together.

I really enjoyed the friendstolovers aspect of this novel. It was not a blatant friendstolovers plot, but rather a slowly developed friendship followed by thoughts of whatif. I also totally love all the secondary characters that Layne never forgets to include. And while this is not my favorite Lauren Layne novel that place is reserved for After the Kiss, this book was sweet, had highs and lows, and was overall just a great novel and exactly what I needed to read.",LOVE this,Wow I loved this book

Takes the tick out with the head every time
Simple to use
Good product design. The little scoop holds the tick so it does not fall back on the dog or on you !
Good Price

Bad points
If you are able to get a grip of the tick, then it will come out with the head. However, I had a couple of instances where I tried to pull the tick out, and the tick's body would slip between the little slots. That worried me, because squeezing the tick body releases it is bacteria which can transmit diseases.

One of my dogs got two pretty big lumps after removing ticks with this tool, and I think it is because the tick did not come out the first time I tried causing her to get an infection. I had to take her to the vet and she was ok, no tick born diseases , just a severe allergic reaction to the tick bite that required some antibiotics.

Also, my dog did not like having the ticks pulled out with this tool. She yelped both times.  After that, I decided to go back to using tweezers with her.

You can give it a try. It works for one dog, but not for the other.","Good Price Bad points If you are able to get the grip of your tick, then it will come out with that head",It's ok

3266,"Although it is stated plainly on the front of each package of labels Will not life or peel, these labels do lift, I am guessing from the movement of air created as a disc spins inside any machine, causing the edge of labels to lift.  If your disc sits inside a drawer or a front cover can be lifted to insert or remove a disc, there is less problem.  If your disc is inserted into a slot car CD players or my Bose system and that edge lifts, it will be near impossible to eject the CD.  Such was my problem; I had to have someone remove the front panel in our van, retrieve the discs from the player, only to find that not being able to eject the affected disc had also damaged the drop down mechanism as each of six discs was to play.  I called Avery Dennison at one time, spoke to someone in, perhaps, India; ""Oh, no, we have had no reported problems.""  Instead they sent me a package of the CD labels.  I wrote to the company, received two additional packages of labels in response to my letter.  So, after a new disc player was installed in our van, I packed all unused lables, the unopened packages of labels, the applicator and any receipts I could find, including for installation and purchase of a new disc player, copied all of those receipts, and sent them back to the company.  I will be waiting to see just what action, if any, they take.  There is a new program, LightScribe, for labeling discs that works with the same mechanism used to burn CDs.

No, there is no song titled ""Living Proof"" here.  But that title is a reference to the most outstanding song on the CD, ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"".

The present tense account is interjected with journal entries from Antonia and they do not always seem relevant. This is a multifaceted love story that is built on lies and subterfuge. There is some history of Venice, and quite a lot of general travelogue info on Siena, Venice and a bit of Florence. Very enjoyable if you have been to Italy. Vivaldi yup, the composer!, is a main character in this story. Keep in mind that this is FICTION and the musical story lines will be much more enjoyable. There are battles between healthy and unhealthy relationships  that consume the 400 pages.  The writing is good yet I would have liked to understand the characters a bit sooner in this tome. Perhaps if I cared about them a bit more, reading Antonia of Venice would have been slightly less burdensome.",This is a multifaceted love story that's built on lies and subterfuge,Hhhhmmm...
3289,"This is one CD I enjoy listening to over and over again. Though it is nearly four years old, Hello, to me, is still as entertaining today as it was when '90s alternative was in its heyday.
""Angry Johnny""  compelled me to by this package.  Its lyrics as well as those in the other  tracks reveal a highly creative individual who can put herself inside so  many characters of so many different personalities.
It stands out as a  classic on its own. Though it is often categorized in sections labeled  ALTERNATIVE, it is a grave injustice to place POE's material alongside  issues of alternative grunge groups whose only purpose has been to revamp  the cheesy '80s metal themes of human depravity while leaving out the Big  Hair and Glam rock image.
May POE's next release arrive soon. I am  waiting, POE!!!!!",Great CD!,Looking forward to more POE

3295,"Filament is relatively cheap, but time is valuable. I had 3 consecutive print fails when I first tried to use this filament. I finally stopped and looked at it, the filament was riddled with bulges and thick spots, causing jams, and twice it jammed bad enough that I had to disassemble the printer to get the filament out of the feed mechanism. QC needs to be improved!!!! Wasted much time, which is more infuriating than wasting filament.

Edit: I received a new Meltink replacement package, in cool grey. This time the filament was of uniform width and did not jam in the feed mechanism at all. From the prints that I tried  admittedly small, difficult ones  I must say that this filament is very interesting. I have been using Hatchbox filament, and I notice that this filament is significantly stronger than the former. I also watched the printer perfectly print out three vertical rods half a millimeter wide, about 3mm apart, something that I have been having difficulty with when using other filaments. no wobble at all, just perfectly straight thin, vertical sections. In its molten state, it seems a little more viscous than other filaments, maybe it is just me. But bed adhesion was pretty good on glass.

3303,"I had high hopes for this program when I requested it. I had used Corel products before and appreciated their versatility, especially for modifying photographs and clipart. Unfortunately, this product was a major disappointment in more ways than one:

First, it was not compatible with Windows Vista, the operating system on my computer, so I had to install Corel Painter on another machine.
Second, there were samples on the box of what the program could do, but no instructions in how to make it happen. I tried looking at the tutorials online, but they were not much help.

I tried playing around with the program and experimenting with the various features, but could not figure it out, as I have other Corel and Microsoft products. Maybe I was not daring enough and did not have the advantage of a touch screen or stylus to make this program work. At any rate, it is not for me.

3307,"When I read that Jethro Tull was going to release a Christmas album, I immediately thought ""uhoh! this might be the beginning of the end folks."" I mean, let us face it, this kind of project is just ripe with opportunities for the band to take that slippery slide down into the inescapable pool of mediocrity. There would be our beloved band on the ""seasonal budget shelf"" with the likes of Dolly Parton, Donny  Marie, and The Partridge Family hocking their trite and uninspired covers of ""holiday classics.""
But, fear not! This is Ian and the lads, and they have produced yet another masterpiece! The song selection is a mixture of appropriate tunes from their vast catalog, all masterfully rearranged and rerecorded with the mature and polished skill of a band at the top of it is game. There are arrangements of some quintessentially British holiday songs done in Bristol fashion; and a few new songs that are destined to become classics, including A WINTER'S SNOWSCAPE, my favorite song from Martin Barre's new solo album  Stage Left.
It is also great to hear our old friend Dave Pegg lending his talent on a few songs, notably his wonderful mandolin playing on the classic ""A CHRISTMAS SONG."" Sometime standin drummer James Duncan also lends his talent to this album.
This is a great, great album and a welcome addition to the Tull body of work. It is appeal will guarantee repeated playing for years to come during the holiday seasons, but it will get it is fair share of playing time in the dog days of summer as well.
Enjoy",Totally upbeat,"Fear not, intrepid Tull fans!"

3317,"Unlike years past, HR Block founded by a guy named Bloch decided to charge $16 for each efile, Federal or state.  Only one version, ""Premium FederalStateEfile"" includes a ""free"" Federal efile and state efile; but that version costs $70, so there is no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for efiling.  There are websites that give you completely free efiling; my favorite is TaxAct at taxactonline dot com.  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes efiling.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and efile for free, with NO income restriction!

I do not work for any of these companies, nor any taxrelated company, nor any such entity.  I just do not think it is right for HR Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for efiling, whereas people can efile for free elsewhere.  BY THE WAY, if you use Taxcut to prepare your return, you will have to use HR Block's efiling service if you want to efile; you cannot just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.

Both versions have a tint so you can see where you are applying it. You have to work evenly to avoid streaks, and be prepared to touch up a little with your mitt NOT included.

It is low on fragrance, but what I did detect was not necessarily a pleasant smell. Not terrible, but eh.

As far as color, it is natural looking but it is more of a pale brown with no hint of a golden tan, so be sure that is the color hue you are looking for.

It dries well.  I am always concerned about color transfer. I feel like I cannot touch anything, sit anywhere, or get dressed for a long time after applying a tanner.  This dries nicely but the mousse version dries very fast. I did not notice any transfer on my shirt or elsewhere.

The color fades by day 4 or so and it mostly gone by day 6.

I am somewhat fair skinned but still found the color natural enough. I just would have preferred a slight more realistic shade.

Overall, it works and does not smell. It is no more streaky than other lotion tanners and if you are careful you will get good results. The color is what would make me not buy this again, it is too brown to be completely realistic.",It's not for me,Average Tanner....

3342,"Economical but effective car clay.

Car clay is used to remove embedded particles from your car's clear coat paint finish.  The clay will grab and pull the particulate contaminants from the car's soft clear coat.  After the contaminants have been removed, you can proceed to sealing the paint with wax.

Please note that you do not and should not clay your car with your weekly car cleaning.  You only need to use the clay if the paint still feels rough after you clean the car.  Spray a liquid lubricant on the surface and then move the clay back and forth on the surface.  Do not put a lot of pressure.  You are not buffing the car.  You are simply sliding the clay across the paint.  Turn the clay and periodically flip to a clean side.  Some car clays come with a spray bottle of lubricant, but soapy water works just as well.

Clay is a gentle abrasive.  It is safe to use for most paints.  This product, Towel Motors Car Clay Bar, is an awesome deal.  You get two clay bars, packed in a tin container.  There is a sheet of wax paper inside to keep the clay from drying out.  Highly recommended.","Very effective, very abrasive",Car Clay

Installing VIPRE on a NETBOOK:

  All you have to do is put your VIPRE installation disc into your computer's drive and copy the disc's content onto an empty thumb/flash drive. Once the files are successfully copied insert the flash drive into your net books usb drive and follow the onscreen installation instructions! It is that easy!

3361,"After his 2006 album ""Release Therapy"", Ludacris seemed to get a lot of criticism for a deeply personal album that was not really that bad. He bounced back with his best effort to date 2008's ""Theater Of The Mind"" and things seemed to be going well at least that is how Ludacris tells it. He talked about a concept album called ""Battle Of The Sexes"" a duet album between himself and Shawnna best known for appearing on his song ""What is Your Fantasy"" and her hit ""Gettin' Some"". Unfortunately, Shawnna abandoned the project midway through completion, and rather than shelve the album, Ludacris soldiered on with the project. The end result is Shawnna appearing only on three songs ""I Do It All Night"", ""B.O.T.S. Radio"" and the phone sex inspired ""Feelin' So Sexy"".

There are other guests who fill the absence left by Shawnna. Nicki Minaj steps in for the song ""My Chick Bad"", NeYo appears on the Swizz Beatz produced ""Tell Me A Secret"", and Trey Songz makes a cameo on the rather dull ""Sex Room"". The songs ""Everybody Drunk"" and ""Party No Mo'"" are horribly out of place on this album. In fact, the only song that actually is in line with the concept of the album is ""B.O.T.S. Radio"". Things come to a close with the final track, The Neptunes produced ""Sexting"" which makes light of the Tiger Woods scandal. The problem with this album aside from the production is the album overall is misleading regarding the concept of ""Battle Of The Sexes"". The album title should have been ""Pandering To The Sexes"" being that is what is done on the entire album. If you are a Ludacris fan, you may want to sit this one out.","You are a familiar ""lease"" fan","""Battle Of The Sexes"" is hands down the worst Ludacris album"

For hair that is heavy and straight, I can walk out the house with hot Louisiana humidity with tight curls and end the day with soft curls still intact.  No complaints there. It takes a minute to figure out how to use it, if you have never used one before, but for an amateur, I did a pretty good job the first go around. It also heats quickly and stays hot while using it.",Works very well,I'm now a fan of the curling wand!
3365,"I refurbish and repurpose cast iron cookware and pretty much anything that is cast iron because it is my passion. When my boss who owns a barn in Connecticut that was built in the 1700's found this out, he immediately thought it would be a fun challenge to start digging up old cast iron pots that he would find in the ground in his barn to bring to me to see what I could do to bring them back to life. The first project he gave me was an antique SP Kettle pot. It was severely cracked on the bottom. When it comes to cast iron, you have to weigh your options and in this case it really was not worth having somebody weld it together for me because it could have created more damage because the crack was that severe. I felt because this was not going to be used for cooking and a great repurposing project, I consulted with my service managers because they work with these kind of materials and would know what kind of bonding agents in materials would be best to use that would be effective to do the job for these kind of projects. Because my job involves working with plumbing and cast iron and things of that nature, I knew that I was talking to probably some of the best resources. They recommended this product and I purchased two tubes from Amazon because I was not sure exactly how much of this stuff I was going to or needed to use. Sometimes it is always hard to tell from the picture on Amazon as opposed to what you get when you actually receive it in the mail. It is a putty type material and it is white. I only used one tube and",Great product,I refurbish and repurpose cast iron cookware and pretty much anything that's cast iron because it's my passion

3377,"I have been using Trend Micro on my main computer for around four years now, and my wife has as well. Our experiences have been mixed. While it does really well at nixing cookies which is true for this as well, it sometimes does not do so well at other viruses, though. In our experiences, we have had good results by scanning, defragmenting the drive, and then scanning again. Repetition of this pattern for some time got rid of one pernicious virus that we had, but I have caught something on my computer that this product has not caught, yet. As far as this particular program, we have been running it for about a week and a half. So far, it seems to perform about as does the more mainstream version. There are a wealth of more complex options, all of which seem to be designed to, essentially, protect you from yourself. If you are careless enough to need these, odds are good that you did not bother to turn them on. Basic virus protection is good, and this product will probably suit most people's needs. Unless you visit a lot of warez sites and spend too much time downloading torrents, you probably will not get a virus that this cannot handle. And, if you do, computers have a half life of something like a year and a half before replacement, so you probably should not worry too much about that. A major plus was the install. We installed this on a netbook that has no digital media reader i.e., no CD/DVD ROM drive. By using the website, we bypassed this need. The key on the CD worked with the online download, which was both nice and surprising. Overall, its a good program. It does what it is supposed to",Good antivirus,Easy to install

On the cover, you have the stars of the showChuck Norris and Lee Marvin with special appearances by Chuck's ubermullet and Lee's eyebrows that looked like wings in case his head decided to fly away holding bazookas, undoubedly poised to blow some terrorists to bits. Unfortulately, that is about as good as it got. The plot followed no logic and we, Sid the Elf, have no respect for those who have no respect for logic. The first explosions after the opening credits happened about an hour into the film. If it is Sid, he says that move does not have it. Nobody is watching a movie staring Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin to see an enthraling plot and good acting. We want to see 128 minutes of nonstop explosions, cool guns, people being thrown off stuff, necksnappings, and roundhouse kicks out the thing. It is a real easy formula. Whoever made Delta Force 2 had the recepie. Delta Force was just lacking. It pains us, Sid the Elfbecause we love Chuck and think he is as much of a one man wrecking crew as the next reviewerto say NO DEAL to Delta Force.",Great movie for the price,The only way Chuck gets only 3 stars is when he's weighed down by a mutant mullet and Lee Marvin's eyebrows

3406,"Awesome game!!! I hurt my wrist about 1/3rd the way through, and I cannot stand it!!!!!! It is driving my crazy that I have to wait until it heals up some to finish this game!!!! AAAAARRRGGGG!!!!! :P This is a real 'head above the rest' game. You get the 'open world', the fun car driving, and from car shooting, running on foot first person shooter, robot driving, and the great story progression all in one. I played Red Faction: Armageddon first, and just loved it so much with the grave gun. I would giggle like a schoolgirl, throwing huge monsters around and bouncing them off the ceilings and walls! I thought this game would be far less fun without it. They really made these two games very different. The Red Faction: Armageddon is a linear game. You do not have the open world like this one. The only thing about the game play that is really the same is the destructible environment carries to the next game. You must appreciate both types. I think this game rates right up there with borderlands. Red Faction: Armageddon plays more like a 'Half Life' style game. Red Faction: Guerrilla needs some strategic thought on how to accomplish many of the missions. If you just charge right in you will just bang your head against the wall. You just run out of ammo, get dead, and have to start over. I bet most of the lower ratings come from people who think they should just be able to charge straight in shooting without thinking through a good stratagy, and get their buts kicked by the game. Summation: If you use some strategic thinking you will find this game provides many hours of really fun and challenging adventure!!! I have put in around 8 hoursI","Awesome game!!!

Of course, I tried some myself and was quite pleased despite the steep price.

In short, this is as tasty as any mochi I have tried at any frozen yogurt establishment.  It is far more moist, as one might expect due to the sealed package in which the product is sold.

3437,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",Works. the kit is great in what it consists of and,good kit with some caveats

3442,"In order to understand the deep sea of Lewis' thinking and opinions, it is necessary to explore the many streams and rivers of thought, experience and philosophy that contributed to that great ocean of erudition. Lewis was a scholar who read an incredible amount of material in the course of his life. Throughout his writings one finds continuous references to ideas and observations that he picked up from the great writers of the ancient and medieval world, as well as his own great contemporaries. Lewis debts to these writers inevitably leads one to seek out and explore them as well.
In my own case, I discovered two of my favorite writer/thinkers, G. K. Chesterton and George MacDonald, through my reading of C. S. Lewis. The book under review gives one an expanded opportunity to discover and enjoy the reading heritage that was so important to Lewis and to the development of his theology and philosophy. Even more, it allows children of a desicated age to experience and drink in some of the great thinkers and writers of our Western heritage. Writers who, alas, are no longer shared with students as a part of what we used to call a higher education.
Therefore, if you love C. S. Lewis, Western Civilization, or just reading, get this book, read it, think it and treasure it. It will be one of the best investments that you have ever made.",A bestselling book that I've read,Rivers of Thought

3454,"DIRTY WORK sets out what it accomplishes and that is to entertain on an uncomplicated low denominator level. Norm MacDonald Mitch and Arte Lange SamSNL meets MAD TV are two losers who open up a revengeforhire business in order to raise money for Sam's Dad Jack Warden who needs a heart transplant. This sets up several gags as people hire these guys for various pranks most of which are hilarious shaving the evil ""Beared Lady"" at a carnival sideshow hired by a jilted ""little person"". This leads up to the main plot of an evil real estate developer Cole Chris McDonaldHAPPY GILMORE who hires the pranksters to do his 'dirty work' to have a building condemned.  Realising, that they may hurt the very people they are trying to fight for, they must undo their destruction. Norm MacDonald's SNL persona is evident here as he uses some of his deadpan, understated schtick he used during his tenure on the show especially when he did the Weekend Update segments i.e. ""Note to Self.."" etc. This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on MadTV and is now one of Howard Stern's posse on Stern's syndicated radio show. Lastly, the movie has some funny cameos to help the plot along John Goodman, Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler and Don Rickles along with love interest played by Traylor Howard who seems to be on a failed TV pilot a few times during a televison season as Kathy.  Overall, sophomoric and low brow on a very hilarious level. Note: Classic line as Mitch and Sam are in a bar fight.

3459,"These work exactly as intended. Some reviewers state ""junk, the white cap comes off after crimping."" My response to that is, yes it will happen if it is not crimped correctly. I experimented with several different crimper devises I use, and as long as it was crimped correctly, the cap stayed on tight. Make sure you have the correct amount of bare wire going completely into the crimp connector. On the ones that did not get a good crimp, it was easy to pull the entire connector off or just the white cap alone. Make sure you have a quality set of crimpers. The ratcheting type are some of the best I have. There are several sizes of crimper jaws and patterns. I use the appropriate ones for each particular connector and you should not have any problems. I will not use crimp connectors anywhere I need a good solid hard wire connection. I always solder and heat shrink most of my connections for that reason. They will not come loose when soldered. I do a lot of offroad lights, trailer lights/wiring and motorcycle wiring and have no returns coming back due to faulty repairs, crimps or solder jobs.

I can listen to Piper at any scale I want togrooving to the general sound of a song brings out one thing, but paying attention to the details brings out seventeen different new songs. There are as many songs in this album as you have time to notice, because the album is a well connected play of genius like almost nothing I have ever heard. Syd Barrett sounds like he is molesting his guitar, and his style is like something developed in seclusion from all previous currents of music. I guess I could call it protospacefunkonspeed, and I like it more than Hendrix. But the two famous guitarists are different. Hendrix, to me, is best for those strange little passages that come out of nowhere, sometimes, in his solos, creating a brief musical world of strangely organic, ""dripping"" melody and rhythm that never was before and never will be again. Barrett is a wizard who uses his guitar to create endlessly inventive unmusical sounds, but layers these sounds together in a frenzied and pounding way that somehow wonderfully makes them into music. WellI guess they are not that much different. Barrett's weird, like listening to a flamenco player with a third hand in the middle of an electrified mental breakdown. But enough of that. He is gorgeous. Meanwhile Wright, the organ player, puts down the moods necessary and achieves some astonishing beauties that",Exactly how the music is in,All I need to live is this album and a supply of bread
3468,"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I would used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought HR Block At Home Deluxe  State 3 years ago instead. I have been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface is not as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it is easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with HR and it was very straightforward. I will be using HR Block from now on.

So many things to love: The internal battery is amazing as we go camping a lot with friends and someone is car is Always dying from either intentionallybut stupidly leaving the car on or just accidentally. In one day I was able to jump start an inline6 and a V8, along with inflating a flat 33 inch tire with juice to spare. The process for jumping is super easy as you can just connect straight to the positive and negative battery postthey say not to connect to the negative post, but instead a piece of grounded bare metal...this is only so very minor sparking does not occur. The only way you are going to get the maximum jump is to connect via the negative post and understand that absolutely no harm will come of the sparks and turn the ignition. There is a idiot light that tells you if you have reversed the cables. The coiled air hose allows for super length12 Feet!!! while inflating and remaining tight and compact when not in usethere is no storage for the hose, so if you want to keep it secured my favorite way is to use an extra large caribiner and attach the through the center and clip it onto the handle.

The compressor itself is truly a beast and has no trouble inflating anything you can think of, well, not a raft.

Between ""Peace Sells...,"" ""So Far So Good, So What,"" and ""Rust In Peace,"" Megadeth had established themselves as a supreme rival for Metallica. What happened here was that Metallica released the 1 seller Sandman record. overrated in my opinion This kind of upset Dave Mustaine, and he swore he would make a record that was better. In my opinion, he succeeded, but I myself do not like the black Metallica record, so I may not be saying much. Generally speaking, when you make a record for mass appeal, you spread yourself out for the sake of appealing to larger groups. Well, that said, this is my opinion. 'Skin Of My Teeth"" is a nice opener. 'Symphony of Destruction' is one of the powerful moments. 'Architecture of Agression' is alright. 'Foreclosure of A Dream' is a nice song. 'Sweating Bullets' is strange but interesting. 'This Was My Life' is also an alright track. 'Countdown to Extinction' is another one of the high points. 'High Speed Dirt' sounds like an attempt to stay heavy, but the magic of former records is not there. 'Psychotron' is pretty much in that category as well. 'Captive Honor' is interesting, but again, it sounds like they are trying to recapture the past without much success. 'Ashes In Your Mouth' is another high point on the record. Generally speaking, this is an alright record, but at the same time, it is hard to really really like it when it followed ""Peace Sells..."" and ""Rust In Peace.""

I do not have large ears, but the bottom of my ear peaks out just a little bit. small ears would probably be enveloped in a nice, pleather cushion. The sound and quality are fine. They, IMHO are what you would expect from a 20$ pair of headphones. The sound is not balanced, but I can hear all of the parts of the music. No levels are really missing as will often happen with cheap speakers. These may not be good for doing work or listening intently, as they lack a clean sound, but perform well in the range where they are strong. The bass is decent. The highs are a little airy. There is very slight white noise/buzz on some frequencies. These sound as if you are sitting in a big outdoor space listening to music instead of having speakers inside or in your car. It is a somewhat harsh sound. In other words, they simply lack audio richness or warmth, even considering that there is no Sub. But as I said, what do you expect for 16$.

3528,"I bought this item based on reviews. For me the bulbs burned out too quickly, but it could have been the bulbs I put in. My main issue is that the bulbs were difficult to put in. Sometimes a bulb would break in my hand while putting it in, or I would chip the ceramic casing, while putting it in, that covers the ends of the bulb after it is in place. You are not supposed to touch the bulbs with your bare hands, touching it will shorten the life of the bulb because of oils on the hands. The recepticle that holds the bulb is spring loaded, as time went on it became more difficult to get the bulbs in. Eventually the spring loaded mechanism became too loose to hold the bulb.

I replaced the unit with a light sensing floodlight; it comes on when it is dark and goes off at dawn. The bulbs can be changed with ease and I can touch them with bare hands. I can direct the two bulbs of the floodlight to provide light excatly where I need it. With the floodlight you do not have to take off, and possibly drop, a glass lens covering the bulb. It will probably be more expensive to operate compared the motion light because it will be on several hours each night.

If a person sees my house as a target from a distance, he sees it is well lit and will look someplace else. With a motion sensing type a person can get closer to my home before the light would come on.

The greatest thing about this truck are the sounds it makes.  The sounds are great, that coupled with the nice bright lights that go off when you are over treasure makes for a great combination.  The white scoop that you can see in the picture lifts off the front and creates a shovel that you can use to dig in the sand or dirt.  I do not think you would want to do much heavy digging with it because it would break, but its really good in the sand and loose dirt.  Overall, its a really cool toy and my daughter uses it from time to time and has alot of fun with it.",Great toy,Cool sounds and lights!

However, it is not that easy...first, as others have said, no way this will carry three bikes unless they are those skinny racing bikes...that is okay because we have only two fat touring bikes. But, even with two we had to rig them on the arms using tiedowns  because the supplied ties were inadequate. We like it only because it is the only way we can carry bikes while pulling a trailer.

3546,"I will say this to all of you critics of people who expect gospel music to actually be gospel music; There is no scriptual backing for going out into the world to reach the youth or old or any lost BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. John 12Happy face smiley2 in short ""If I be lifted in the earth, will draw all men unto me"". The ""I"" Jesus is what/who does the reaching and drawing anyway! We are fishers of men, but our bait is JESUS! The beat has no keeping power, nor does the artist for that matter. Only the I am Jesus has saving and keeping power! Our job is simply to lift him! When you take his name/message notice message because Marvin Sapp accomplished a message w/o a name on ""Never would have made it"" out I do not care who it ministers and appeals to, it are not GOSPEL. I love RB, I love some inspirational, but I do not have to beaten up by scripture because I know how to seperate genres. All the lines have been blurred by US so called christian artists and this is simply the bible fulfilling itself. Right will be wrong and men will be lovers of themselves w/itching ears. That is what causes us to take his name and message out of the music, not our callings and spritual urges to reach a certain demographic. We are no loger seperate and set apart, we are blending right on in. Vickie Winans summed it up for me ""When your music crosses over, be sure to take the CROSS with you!""

3553,"All the gushing reviews about this product are great, there is no doubt that PowerDirector has the best bang for the buck when it comes to features. But there is much more to video editing sofrware than that. Most fail to adequately highlight what is truly wrong with this product, so I will focus on that: 1. ""Fastest video editor"": Translation it is 64bit, like pretty much everything else these days. This is nothing more than marketspeak that CyberLink is using to distract customers from this software's big problems. PowerDirector is indeed very snappy during the editing process, and it is nice, 64bit does make a difference in most cases. But the fact is, any 32bit video editor that has proxy file functionality is just as snappy as PowerDirector. 2. PowerDirector maintains its status as the most buggy, crashprone video editor there is. It might be faster than ever, but this includes how fast it crashes as well. This crashprone behavior is considered a normal part of the user experience with this product. Depending on the crash, this includes the known examples of project files getting corrupted, ""auto save"" or not. PowerDirector is also known for crashing and ruining BluRay discs during the burn process. 3. PowerDirector has MUCH more downloadable content than Corel's VSX5, the selection is really fun but cumbersome. Worse, most all of the content is completely unusable kiddie stuff that just cannot be taken seriously. The good stuff that you might find online takes hours of sifting through the endless menus of usercontributed junk. Like one reviewer pointed out, its just a bunch of teenage girly junk. And most of it is for standard def DVDs, not even HD/BluRay. Most of the stuff I downloaded turned out to be horribly pixelated and unusable for HD. 4.",Great video editor but not in a good fashion,"Why ""Fastest"" Means Nothing"
3554,"Wow! Jackson Cole is the perfect, swooniest, alpha hero I Have read in like, forever! Alexis is just trying to get through her days as she works two jobs to cover the cost of living after years of caring for a sick mother and helping to raise her sister. When Jack makes a move, she is immediately drawn to him but knows he just wants one night, and that is not her thing. At all. Jack is pulled toward Alexis from the first moment he lays eyes on her. His desire becomes almost obsessive. Jack is accustomed to getting anything he puts his mind to but Alexis is making him work extra hard at getting her. And his mind is definitely set on having her. But as he continues to pursue the seemingly unattainable woman, he quickly realizes that he wants more than one night. Together this couple ignited the pages of my Kindle! They were perfect for each other. Alexis has a few trust issues which were completely understandable due to Jacks past. That past ensures there is a good bit of other woman drama here. However, Jack is all about Alexis and that never once changes. I loved watching Alexis grow to accept that what she had with him was the real thing. And I absolutely adored watching Jack fall and fall hard. This is one of those reads that just checks all your boxes for what you want in a low angst, high steam romance with a likable heroine and most importantly the perfect possessive/protective and jealous hero. There are just no words for how incredible this couple are.

Unless they are talking about taking the bottom hoseinlet off the housing and letting the water flush it out.... To review the product, Let me start by saying, if this NEW pump we just ordered continues to work for more than a month, then I will say it is not half bad. We got this one to upgrade the dinky pump that came with our 10' x 30"" which is actually about 26' deep when filled to recommendationMetal Frame Intex pool. The 530GPH just did not clean the pool like we needed it to. This pump however, on this particular pool does GREAT to move the water and keep it clean. BUT, this dumb thing just up and died for NO reason the other day. Worked FINE the day before. Turned it offtest button on the GFCI plug which is also plugged into a GFCI outlet which is also on a switch we can turn off as well. Next morning, went out to turn it on, Nada. Reset button will not reset. Errgghhhhh!!! Honestly, for the cost it is not bad. But if you are buying it from the Intex company, you are going to pay A LOT more for this model pump and it is just not worth that much! So, we ordered another one from Amazon and will modify some of the things we think might have contributed to it quitting on us, 1 is the amount of time we ran it ever day. Way over the recommended ""Not more than 8 hours daily."" Got To see if there is some way we can get it on a timer. The other things",Not bad for this pump,Ugh!  Damn You Intex!  Damn You!

3587,"This book far surpasses the expectations set by its simple premise  a series of interviews of an unnamed hedge fund manager who specialized in trading emerging market debt through the financial crisis of 2008. No secrets are revealed about the inner workings of the global financial system, and the factual content of the book can be found elsewhere. This book is great not because it explains a credit crunch, or how to trade bonds or manage portfolio risk it does not even attempt to do these latter things, but because it provides an intelligent, funny, highly opinionated synthesis of farreaching finance, economics, and even philosophy. Many readers will disagree with points made by the anonymous hedge fund manager who holds court in these pages, but I think any reader would benefit from the internal dialog with him we have while reading.

The end of the book, after the crisis is over, is not as compelling as the first part of the text.

3589,"I had to trace a number of curcuits behind drywall in a home renovation project, this tool made it possible. The tone is strong enough to easily find wires behind drywall, but this is also the source of my one and only complaint: If you have a box with several electrical lines going into it, even if you separate all the lines inside the box and at their ""far"" ends so that there is zeero continuity between separate lines, the signal still tends to ""splash"" onto all the other lines. In a box with three lines I got signal on all three even though the tone generator was only attached to one. This is more pronounced where the lines are closest together at the box, of course. This led to some confusion when I was in a small closet and no matter where I put the probe I got signal! Imagine my surprise to see that the line I was tracing lead not only UP from the box to the ceiling, but DOWN to the floor as well.... and off to the side too! Whoops! That are not right! However with a little patience and understanding of what was happening I was able to eventually sort out the individual runs. Further from the box the signal drops off on the nonconnected lines faster than on the connected line. So I had to take a few educated guesses as to where the line I was tracing might be, and then move far away from the box and look for it. With a few tries I found each line and traced them to their ends. Bottom line: this thing works, and it works thorugh drywall, but it still requires you to use some brains.

3595,"My daughter, 15 yo, and myself, old mom, got to play around with both the NUDE and SAND colors. It was fun. One thing I can tell you is that neither the SAND nor the NUDE will work for anyone with a really pale complexion. My daughter is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion and both of these concealers looked like blushes on her. One the other hand, I with my slightly reddish complexion did fine with both. Go figure. I put it on my cheeks where I have a tiny broken vein and both hid it. PROBLEMS When I say that the SAND and NUDE concealer hid the tiny red line that is my broken vein I mean that if I dabbed them on that they did their job. If I swiped them on they did not cover the spot. You have to build up some of the slightly waxy concealer. Which brings up another problem that I noticed. The moment I put a foundation on over the concealer the concealer vanished. It would appear to have dissolved and blended too well with the foundation. I also found another test subject. One with an age spot on her hand. I have put up two pictures with and without the concealer so you can see it at work. Pale skin. I talked about it above but if you are pale neither of these concealers will look natural. With my poor camera skills you might not be able to make out the difference, but I tried to show what they look like on my daughter. SUMMARY I am actually likely to wear this without foundation. The reason being that if I dabdabdabbed it on it certainly covered nicely but it did not stay put when I tried it with foundation.",Fun!,"Works But Not for a Porcelein Skin, Doesn't last."

1. The cast: Boggess sings beautifully, but she overacts this part to death, and it is both frustrating and annoying.  Ferguson is absolutely atrocious as Carlotta, and also is guilty of overacting.  Not to mention the fact that she has a horrible voice.  Karimloo sings ok, but is as dull as dishwater here.  There is no anger, no sorrow, no passion, no unfulfilliable longing in his portrayal at all.  Of course, vocally, Boggess and Karimloo do well, but that is not enough, especially when Boggess speaks.  The rest of the cast is ok, none of principal's can compare with Crawford, Brightman, Barton and Ashe.  Not even close.

2. The recorded sound on this recording is horrible.  I bought the DVD and ripped it to MP3 to get better audio.

3608,"When news of a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics spread, it seemed the world became merrier, peaceful, and precious. So it is real, I may have thought, dreams can come true. Yet, as hype can sometimes turn as a spiteful enemy, journalists professed that the next installment to FF Tactics was not proper to its heir. Totally unsurprised and a wee bit infuriated, I still clung on to my gaming faith to see how Square Enix's first YOU.S. game fared. Its been quite a wait, and a Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is finally available. Those journalists were right though, the game does not truly feel as an authentic sequel. Gone are the Lion Wars, the distraught St. Aujora, the heroics of Ramza, and a considerable number of things that charted the original. It is puzzling to assume why Square does what it does. I mean would not have you gained much, much more acclaim if you were to craft a direct sequel on the next generation console? Instead they design an unrelated story and throw it on the Game Boy Advance. It was hard to climb out of my mountain of expectations, but once I accepted what the game was, I was aware that Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is an honorable addition to the Square Enix collection. Ignoring my lofty hopes of a greater predecessor, in terms of the Game Boy Advance, the latest strategy whirl on the Game Boy Advance pulls off exceedingly. Starring Marche, a rather reticent kid, he befriends two of his classmates, and because of opening a magical tome, they all awake in the world of ""Final Fantasy."" Stranded there, all of them go their separate ways, living an alter life of knights, princes, fighters, wizards, and all that which delineates the realm of fantasy.

I have owned and used many headsets over the years a few SteelSeries and there always seems to be something new for PC, gaming consoles, mobile devices and DJing. As I always enjoy testing out new headphones here are my thoughts on the SteelSeries Flux InEar Pro Headset for Gaming and Music; Pros 3 different interchangeable ear tip sizes 1 set of foam ear tips are included as well complete with a compact and convenient carrying case for everything.

Multiplatform use PC, Mac and all mobile devices. Main length of cord is flat and very sturdy some may view this as a Con. Decent noise isolation. Cons High price point of $129.99. Inserting them into your ears can be bothersome until you get the hang of it and beging doing it on a regular basis. Also, if you wear glasses keeping the cords wrapped behind your ears can be troublesome. Cord is a bit too short to be of practical use. The main flat cable length is only 31 inches with the total length from earbuds to jacks being 52 inches. This headset is meant to be worn wrapped behind the ears so you lose some length because of this design. In ear headphones are not for everyone. Many people experience discomfort while attempting to wear them. I have very narrow ear canals so using the smallest ear tips is essential to avoid excess pressure. Overall lackluster sound quality.

3619,"This is an interesting take on the relationship of King Henry II of England and his wife and Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Based upon a stage play by James Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts, it has the feel of theatre to it, rather than film. Here, Henry and Eleanor are in their golden years. Henry is fifty and his wife, whom he has had imprisoned for the last ten years, is several years older. He brings her out of captivity for Christmas, and she joins him and their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John. Peter O'Toole gives a fine portrayal of the aging, but still robust and virile, Henry, who is in a seeming quandary as he debates a burning issue. To whom of his three sons shall he leave his hard won kingdom? He professes to want to leave it to his youngest, John, as that is the son whom he claims to love the most. One has to wonder, however, what kingly qualities he sees in John, played as a pimply faced, sixteen year old fool by Nigel Terry, who does what he can with this unsympathetic role. Eleanor, however, tartly played by the always glorious Katherine Hepburn, prefers her oldest, Richard, who is the son whom she has loved the most, though he, too, has his issues. Richard is played as a blood thirsty homosexual by a somewhat wooden Anthony Hopkins in his screen debut. No one seems to love the middle son, Geoffrey, and he knows it, though he seems to be the one son whose behavior is the most within the bounds of what one might consider acceptable, as he is neither a killer nor a fool. He is merely unloved by his parents.","Enticingly complex, but still robust and virile.","A MEDIEVAL VERSION OF ""WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?""..."

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2step process which I do not want to do.  I would rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it is kind of inbetween.  It is not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it is definitely not a cream.  It is definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you would not need to wipe any residue off your hand.",good quality soap,The cream in the tubes has done much better for me.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

I thought it would be fun to make a family tree and talk to my family so I knew a little more about those related to me.

But there is one twist that is probably weird. My natural father died and I have been adopted by my step father. I do not want to make two family treesboth sides of the family are family to me. I do not see a way to customize this software at all to allow what I want to do.

And that is my main complaint. If your family tree has no twists or turns, the software looks like it works ok. But to do anything out of what it wants to do seems to be impossible.

So I am probably going to just make something up in Word or Publisher. It looks like most of the records that Family tree maker looks up are with Ancestry.com, so I assume I will be able to get an Ancestry.com account and get the same records that I would have in Family Tree Maker.

3672,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Great product!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

3674,"Just today I finally put the old generic grill cover in the trash.  It came from the Lbox home store and cost somewhere in the high $20s.  It was thin and flimsy. The squirrels and chipmunks easily had their way with it. Good riddance.  WELL! This cover is NONE of that! This thing is absolutely gorgeous and built like the proverbial battleship. It weighs a relative ton and takes a little practice to put in place.  But I have no doubt that this cover is seriously capable of outlasting the grill that you put it on.  The outside is a heavy nylon fabric and it is lined with tough vinyl.  The lining helps it slide into place, so once you figure out the technique, it goes on and off very easily.  It comes equipped with appropriately located straps and snaps if you want to anchor it down.  Unless you are expecting a replay of Hurricane Sandy, you probably will not need to use these.  And, to top it off, there are two builtin nylon fabric handles on top naturally to assist in situating it exactly where you want it.

3677,"Calvin Klein Euphoria for Men Liquid Gold EDP is a modern version of a spicy and woody oriental fragrance. It was launched in 2014 but initially sold mostly in Middle Eastern/South Asian markets, as it does have notes that are more popular in those markets. If you would just asked me to sniff the perfume and guess the house, I would have never guessed CK as they are known for more summery, lighter, citrusy fragrances. This is pretty intense  harking back to Obsession days.

This is an extremely spicy and masculine perfume, that has a strong presence and is on the opposite end of the lighter, citrusy, acqua fragrances like Acqua di Gio. At first whiff it can seem overpowering but it becomes subtler after a while. Top notes are black pepper giving it the spice, a middle note of saffron and a base note of sandalwood, it seems linear but it does have longevity. It lasted quite long on me, I applied it to my wrists, and I still got a faint whiff a few hours later.

3681,"This is a great movie adaptation. Is a must have for Star Wars fans. You get to play as Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi. They are similar in gameplay, but each one has special cool moves. As you beat the levels of the game you get very cool unlockables, including bonus missions and characters too. This game is one of the best Star Wars games ever. I was afraid that after too much hype the game would not deliver, but it is a fairly challenging game, you can play it in easy normal and difficult mode to adjust it to your playing skills. The missions are rather short, but the bosses will take various tries to beat since you have to get a strategy and they have Jedi, or Dark Side powers which makes them more difficult, but it does not get to the point of being frustrating. The game is addictive and only getting tired of smashing buttons against a tough boss will make you want to stop. Another cool part is that you develop your characters with experience points. There are four types of kills Fair, Good, Impressive and Masterful, the higher the rank the more experience points you get and the faster you may develop your character. Also there are many hidden secrets through the missions, including boss levels. If you cannot get them on the first time around, you can play any of the missions once they have been beaten. If you liked the EA Lord of the Rings games, you would definitely would want to play this one. And as those games you get to watch integrated into the game scenes from the actual motion picture.

I am sad that it is come to an end but Breathe Again has given me everything I could have asked from them and so much more. Some I was expecting and some not so much. I loved just about every minute of this book from the second I opened it to the last word I read in the book. If you thought that their story could not get any better, well Rachel certainly will prove you wrong. I believe that this book hit the nail on the head and cemented my love for them. Tate and Sav Forever! Things were kind of left in a bad way for Tate and Sav at the end of Breathless. I imagine there were sad faces everywhere. Sav has not spoken to Tate since the whole Chelsea debacle. Sav has been in New York and has even extended her time there. It is time to face the music as they say. She and Tate are having a baby. They both need to make some big decisions in order to move forward. Thanks to Mr. D. they are finally forced into the same room. Tate is able to explain to Sav what the Chelsea thing was all about. Sav decides that Tate really does love her, and their family is everything to the both of them. They momentarily have a pretty great HEA. Then they do not. There are a lot of unresolved problems that they eventually face and their love is tested. There is some tragedy and my heart truly broke for this couple. I wanted so much for them.

3697,"I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15foot dryer duct run. It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be rewritten and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here is my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise not reverse mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you are screwed. 5. Read 4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

I was really pleased to find that the keyboard came to me precharged, ready to use, a nice touch. As a fast typist and mouse user on a conventional PC for many years, this device seems a bit slow and clunky to use by comparison. It is thumb typing, not touch typing. Positioning the mouse is not as rapid for me as a ""real"" mouse. The tradeoff, of course, is the small size. A full conventional keyboard and mouse requires a lot of space and a table surface.

3719,"Every day, the boy would come to the tree and gather her leaves, or play in her branches, or sleep in her shade.  The tree loved the boy and the boy loved the tree.  At first, this was all each one needed to be happy.  But as the boy grew older, he began to want other things and he forgot about the tree.  One day the boy came back and asked the tree for money.  The tree, wanting the4 boy to be happy, tells him to gather her apples and sell them in the city.  The boy does as he is told, and goes away for a long time.  Twice more he comes to the tree after being away and asks for something.  Each time, the tree gives what the boy asks for, until she is no more than a stump.  Even an old stump is good for something though.
This is a wonderful story about the friendship between a boy and a tree, and the sacrifices one must make to keep the other happy.  The joy that the tree finds from giving serves as a great example for people of all ages.  The story has a touch of sadness to it, but there is something uplifting about it, too.

I already have and love both Sandy Denny's and Judy Collins' versions of this song, but this one was neither.  I went up to the counter to find out who it was, and the salesman enthusiastically informed me that it was from Eva Cassidy's latest album.  Since I already have ""Songbird"" I knew who she was, but I was surprised to find that there are still so many good tracks of hers waiting to be released several years after her sad death.  The next track, You have Changed, was equally beautiful.  I have not heard the rest of the album yet, but will certainly get it.
I think the appeal of Eva Cassidy is simple and encouraging  in an age when most pop records sound as if they are computergenerated in a factory somewhere, she sang every song straight from the heart.

While you can check your filing status by bringing up TurboTax and selecting check status, and can change the birth date and then refile, it is a problem that users should be aware of since it is a simple matter to check the birth dates, or any other data that has been imported from last year.

3778,"I have been using a fountain pen for over 20 years as my regular and preferred writing instrument and tool. I own a nice collection of various pens, inks, cartridges, and replacement nibs.
I switched to writing with a fountain pen over a ball point for a good number of reasons  mainly if you get the right pen NIBs and a nice flow of ink you can turn your everyday writing into something with a little style.

I liked this pen so much that I have ordered more of them with different nibs for various writings. The pen glides easily on most paper with almost no pressure at all. I use the recommended inks and I found a way to reuse the ink cartridges for fast color changes.

At first I did not really like it, but you get used to it.

Pros:
 Having access to all the buttons is good, but no access to power or reset
 Same with being able to use the remote's cord comfortably
 The weight with the remote feels fine
 The look is okayish it is a futuristic one, so far from the boring plain shells you can find from other companies but the RE or HOTD look better to me

Con:
 The trigger is not a trigger, more like a button in a trigger shape so it is not a gun feeling at all... that is quite lame but you get used to it...
 Having the remote before the gun's handle and your hand is not the greatest feeling either, but you also get used to it. You could hold the handle lower than the remote's end, but even with my pretty long hands it makes the trigger a bit too far to be comfortable.
 I wish there was some sort of aimer on the gun, to help maintain the aim but I do not know if any other Wii gun has it.

Though my biggest grip is with the Wii's IR system, it seems really unstable for me, so it really removes from playing the games with this gun.

The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

3825,"""Dracula A.D. 1972,"" starring Christopher Lee as the titular vampire, is one bizarre film. It starts with a prologue set in the 1800s: Lee's Dracula is shown in battle with his nemesis Van Helsing Peter Cushing. As the title indicates, the main body of the film brings Dracula into the 1970s, where he battles Van Helsing's descendant also played by Cushing. Also along for the horror is a young Stephanie Beacham as the second Van Helsing's lovely granddaughter.
The film tries to blend traditional vampiric horror with 70s style youth culture: thus the elements of sex discretely, drugs, and rock 'n' roll permeate the film. To early 21st century viewers, the swingin' music, outrageous mod clothes, hairdos, and wannabe hip slang ""Weird, man. Way out"" of the young cast may come off as more campy than anything else, but it does make the film fun.
Lee is compelling as Dracula: articulate and elegant, yet feral. Unfortunately, his screen time is sparse; his amounts to little more than a small supporting role. The real star of the film is Cushing as the 20th century Van Helsing. The classy Cushing projects real intelligence and ability as his character. He brings total conviction to every scene, and has solid chemistry with Beacham although I think his hands come a little too close to her bosom in a couple of sceneswatch it, ""Grandpa""!. ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" may be far from the best of the many Dracula films, but Cushing and Lee make it worthwhile.",'Dracula A.D 1972,Dracula versus debauched 70s youth culture

Gradually, on very easy level, I have begun to win games as Federer playing the guy from England the all rounder I cannot remember his name. Finally, tonight, I beat the computer in two straight sets. I had just taken a shower but could have used another one after playing. Almost could not believe I won at first. I savored the moment. It was a tense match, but with every point I would find myself swaggering around in front of the TV like the players do after making a killer shot. I also find my self playing with the stringing on the Wiimote ? and twirling it as well. I swear I need a sweat band and wrist bands. What a great game. The Wiimote with the motion plus was difficult to maneuver at first, but I finally got the hang of it. I hold it with the back of the Wiimote facing the TV, and then sometimes shift to the front to get a different angle on the shot.

3851,"The interesting thing about this product is that so many of its pros also wind up being cons. For example: the texture of the cream is very light some have called it almost gellike, and I would agree with that. That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face. The downside to that: it is so light that it does not impart much moisture at all. This would be great for someone who does not have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this does not work for that. For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it is smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin. The scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that. I thought it would be fine for me even though I am very sensitive to strong aromas because ""parfum/fragrance"" is the last item on the ingredient list. Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent. However, that scent does not dissipate at all it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming. By the time I would had it on for about a half hour, I would begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off. Side note: it did not come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove. The packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top",The interesting thing about this product is that so many of its pros also wind up being cons,Very Light Moisturization With A Fragrance That Proves Overwhelming

3860,"After searching all over the internet for just the right door, we decided on this. One thing we liked was that it was a door that actually opened, as opposed to the other popular fairy doors out there that stay locked shut as only 'fairies' can open them. We wanted to take this idea a step further beyond just having a flat, picture background when the door opens. We wanted a door that opened because we wanted to build an actual, physical ""fairy room"" directly into our daughters wall. On the back wall of the fairy room we built, there is a special door that only the fairy can open that leads into ""fairyland."" The door/frame itself is good quality made of sturdy plastic/resin material. We unscrewed the back of the frame so that the solid back came off, leaving just the door and door frame, allowing a passageway through the doorway into the fairy room. Otherwise the back is solid, so you can insert one of the flat background pictures that come as an accessory. It also comes with fairy dust, fairy booklet, fairy mailbox, little fence, and window all of which we did not use. We used our own window frames because we needed 4 matching windows that we placed directly into our daughter's wall to look into the fairy room. The only thing we wished it came with like the other popular fairy doors out there was a brass knocker. We thought the knocker detail just accentuated the whole look and made it feel that much more like a ""real"" little minidoor. As you can see in our pics, we ended up just getting and superglueing a dollhouse knocker onto the door from Hobby Lobby for $2, which worked perfectly in the end.

The game Enter The Matrix, in my opinion, follows the second movie down the same dissatisfying path. To be fair, the graphics are great and the kungfu\gravity bending gameplay is unprecedented and fun to watch. The action moves you can perform play like some of the fight sequences in the films. Unfortunately, the action combos and the wall walking gets old really fast. After about an hour of doing the same martial arts combos and jumping over bullets I began to grow bored with the gameplay. I found myself doing the same thing over and over: Follow the trails, shoot the same guards, do the same moves. There is no variety in this game. You fight and easily kill dozens upon dozens of generic swat cops and security guards. You easily get an autolock on your target, jump through the air and shoot them.... OVER AND OVER AND OVER, LEVEL TO LEVEL TO LEVEL. Gameplay is much too linear, and the lack of any sort of rush coupled with the same recycled orchestral music playing in an endless loop left me wanting more. The game did not convey any real 'get up and go.' Just the same bad guys for you to kill in different rooms. In summary: Pros: Great graphics, great gun and explosion sounds, exceptional gameplay as far as manipulating the environmentwall walking, bullet dodging etc.., Agents are intimidating and fun to fight, clever interposing between gaming and movie clips gives you a better understanding of The Matrix. Cons: Poor lighting and shadows, TOTAL lack of variety from",Very fun and great gameplay,Show me the exit

3873,"The CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 is not a program for a casual user. It is a powerful suite of software used for a variety of graphic art, webpage design, flash animation, and more. It is not my intent to go over every feature the software package, since there are many outstanding reviews already posted. However, I would like to hit the highlights. When compared to Adobe Photoshop as a pure graphics program it is tough to beat Adobe Photoshop. Most of us grew up using Photoshop and Adobe, so in many ways it is intuitive. The CorelDraw Premium Suite has many additional features which helps it to become a onestop solution. In terms of price both programs are roughly at the same price point. What features do you need? As I stated above CorelDRAW is fully loaded suite of software the question is do you need it all? Will you need the video editing software or are you more comfortable with a rival program? Do you need to have the ability to create Flash media? If so.... by all means the CorelDRAW Premium Suite is probably perfect for you! The Video Editor Perfect for YouTube and most video editing applications. While it may not rival Final Cut Pro it will serve the needs of a vast majority of your video needs.... now if you are planning to edit a full length feature film my opinion may be a bit dfferent. Installation You can pick and choose the programs that you want to install. Final Verdict CorelDRAW Premium Suite is a very robust software package. The reason why I am giving it 5 stars is that it may not have the absolute best software for your application it does provide a VERY good option for everything and in terms of value",Perfect for YouTube and most video editing applications,All in One Solution

3876,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave menthol and eucalyptus, as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you will have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this is not a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream. The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and will not negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green preshave. I apply the preshave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking just a few minutes, then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closestever shave with this",The best soap I can have if it uses this,Another great soap from Proraso

Saw some youtube videos of these and I thought this might be a good back up or for lighter snows if i am in a hurry and do not want to take a shower. They also look like the clear drifts well. I cleared about half my driveway medium length 3 cars, snow was probably 34 inches deep with it and then decided to pack it up and return it to the store. I worked very well, just like it does in videos and I thought 12 inches sounded like decent clearance width on paper, but when you figure you overlap an inch or two on passes it takes forever to clear off a medium to larger sized driveway. Like it says on the box, its ideal for patios and smaller driveways as in shorter and 1 or maybe 2 car width. And if that is all its good for I felt like I might as well just get a shovel out instead of having another thing clutter my garage. Might be a nice item though for someone in a townhouse or condo with a tiny driveway, or an elderly person, or maybe someone living in the south where they do not get much snow and do not want a full sized snow blower cluttering their garage but do not count on it to be a workhorse for larger areas needing cleared with heavier snow.",Then I had a nice blower and didn't want to get much snow but should be used for larger areas.,Works well but would take forever to clear a larger area

I am not going to give a song by song. Instead, I will say Kweli's lyrics have been pretty good to me always but his delivery, hooks, voice, and beat selection bothered me too much to pick up most of his cd's, even though i did hear them. This cd is different than his last efforts. This one, is his best or at least next to the last Reflection Eternal. This cd is not commercial. Talking about oil spills, revolution, naming names of unknown or unpopular revolutionaries, and intricate storytelling, rhyme schemes used and this vocabulary is not commercial. I wish commercial artists did sound this good. Commercial artists I thought were about rapping songs where noone could be offended and only saying what is popular to say in society today or rappers scared to make a statement against the status quo and writing lyrics with no depth of thought to fully expand on a point beyond just an analogy or simile, cliche or quote. I thought commercial was to not challenge the listener. This album is great and if his name was not Talib it would probably go platinum like Lupe's next cd will.

If you have a high def. video camcorder or other more recent hardware, the upgrade price may be worth your while to upgradefor me I have found it not worth it. Perhaps it is worth it for more Vista compatibility though, even though I do not use the special Vista features. Pros: You can do a little of just about any type of DVD/CD/VIDEO editing with this softwarebut do not expect Pinnacle Studio or Sony Vegas Studio features. Greater Vista compatibility with some Vista features. There is a slight improvement to the user interface. Directly upload to YouTube and other video sharing websites. Cons: Requires you to buy more licenses for more than one PC even if not used concurrently. Jack of all trades, but master of nonelacks the high end features in most cases that advanced users crave. Downloading updates for the boxed version essentially turns it into the download version of Nero 8. The main drawback to this is that your documentation which is poorly done at best is whiped out rendering you help button and drop down useless. If you want to consult a manual you have to download each one and open them separately. There is no printed manual to speak of included in the boxed version, and for a $100 peice of software I find that unacceptable.

The two books intertwine so closely in certain aspects that the answer to a more descriptive who, what and why of a serial killer that starts out in Greed is explained in Evil. The timeline of Greed is March 2013 to roughly the end of November. Greed starts out with the brutal attack of a woman. This woman is Sarah Tu's sister. Sarah is a cryptologist who works for a company that both creates and test secret codes for programs including for Department of Defense.

It is simple to use, and very intuitive. The oil filtration system works like magic. And I have no oil smell from the container. I can easily disassemble to wash, and it is dishwasher safe. The handbook is not that helpful, and I would not recommend any of the frying temperatures or times. I have found it is better not to fry anything over 350 degrees, and 5 minutes is plenty long for just about anything. Many things can be done in less time.

All shears are SHARP and have been holding their edge very well. They are very comfortable to cut with, they were very comfortable to hold backwards and all sorts of awkward pet grooming angles.

In any event, her novels are very diverting and well written, similar to each other in the way most writers write the same type of story over and over again, blissfully free of the super spy warrior like Reacher, Harvath, Cotton Malone, all of more recent vintage, but even James Bond. They are real people who are good at their jobs, rely on their teams, get hurt and sometimes fail temporarily. I just cannot quite get to the classic 5 star level for her though I enjoy the books very much.  She likes married or coupled up heroes. She likes mountains and mountain climbers, a careful siege of a house and trade craft. She likes drawn out chases with clues and stalking. There is usually a surprise baddy at the end.

3933,"With groups like Yellowcard and other old standbys of the pop/punk genre falling by the wayside, The Academy Is... has brought a true summer soundtrack that is surprisingly good, especially since it is relatively new territory for the band. Sure, the band has made some good, if not inconsistent album, but they always leaned toward the more mature/serious side. 'Fast Times' on the other hand is a sunny summer soundtrack, as it is almost a concept album, as it follows the oftentreked trail of summer love. But what makes it a great album is that they do not try to switch it up too much, try acoustic, or throw in a ballad, they stick with what works and what they know. The album almost never slows down, keeping a steady pace, with most of the songs being rather upbeat. It is a very fun album, and in mood it achieves its goal. Then there is the lyrics, which are hard to follow at times, but they are quite mature and welldone for the subject manner, and again, the lyrics all point to the summer love theme. Add in some very catchy and rockin' songs, and the formula is complete for a great pop/punk/rock album. One might also add that the album really comes together at the end, and again, it is surprising how good it is. Overall, fans of the band will come around to it, fans of the genre will love it as they get the formula perfect, and it might even impress the haters.

Lodger starts out with ""Fantastic Voyage"", which talks little about it is title, more likely about being tired of being unhappy and going on an adventure to get happy. ""African Night Flight"" is probably the most bizzare, outthere song you will ever here from Bowie's factory it has him talking uncontrolably fast about a nonstop trek through the mysterious jungles of Africa, featuring authentic drum beat music and irresistible cricketsynth sounds in the background. Here are some of the sampled lyrics from it: 'On a good day, I could fly/Into the eye of God on high/His burning eye will see me through/One of these days, One of these days, Got To get a word through one of these days'. The song also features some African chanting. ""Yassasin"" is also one of the particularly more odd numbers, sounding like Arabian Night style music and featuring a chorus that goes like this: 'Yassasin/I am not a moody guy/Yassasin/I walk without a sound/Yassasin/Just a man, No judge of men'. ""Red Sails"" sounds like a song you might here on a GET RICH QUiCK infomercial over top of the moronic boat scenery. Nonetheless, it is still an offbeat tale to include in the trilogy. The two singles from Lodger""D.J."" and ""Boys Keep Swinging"" are decent, but no where near the best songs on the album. Personally, they seem more 'catchy tune' equipped. DJ has 'I am the DJ/I am what I play' and Boys Keep Swinging has 'Boys/Boys/Boys/Boys Keep Swinging'. ""Look Back In Anger"" is a great","Most 'catchy tune ever, but nowhere near the best.",Funkiest of the Bowie/Eno collaboration albums
3938,"I have been looking for a sturdy articulating mount for my sharp 40"" tv that will fit in the restricted space of a corner of my bedroom. This one does it. The tv has widely spaced mounting holes, 15 3/4"" vertically. Most mounts that I found at the time tilted, but did not articulate, though I may have just missed it. The wall at the mounting point is only about 3' before the bathroom doorway, but this mount fit well. And the tv mounts bolt to the back, then the tv can be lifted onto the installed mount and hooked over the supports. Kind Of standard, but clever and useful. The supplied level is marginal, but has a little magnetic strip that keeps it on the mount as you are adjusting it to mark the holes to drill. A second pair of hands is useful at this point in any case. Bottom line is it is sturdy, and fits my tv and restricted wall space.",Nice mount for tv and restricted wall space,finally a good fit
3939,"Barry Manilow has written many great songs, and Copacabana is one of those great songs.  This version, disco version, is an infectious version that differs only slightly from the original version; it has more solos than the original one, but other than that, it is basically the same.  If I were to recommend a song from the Barry Manilow library, it would be the disco version of Copacabana At The Copa, just because it has a wildly infectious beat and you can almost picture everything happening while the song plays.

Note: when joining two pieces of wood with pocket hole screws, it pulls them in really tight, so you need to make sure the ends are SQUARE, else the screws will pull the joint crooked. You may want to investigate the technology before purchasing screws. There are several different screw types depending on the types of wood being joined. Soft, hard, or ply woods.

Recently, I bought a less expensive USB 2.0 card at a local retailer thinking a usb card is a usb card.  I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.
That is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try.
It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer. I believe the NEC drivers which this card uses makes it top notch.  I would recommend this card highly.",I only need a USB 2.0 card,Great USB 2.0 Card...

both the 10inch and 12inch pans with lids. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze here I hardly shop
anywhere else online now.

The frying pans are great ... for Christmas dinner for my wife and me, I cooked some New York strips in one pan and onions/peppers/mushrooms in the other and everything turned out great ... best steaks I have had a long time. Lessons learneTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry keep the heat down and the cleanup is much easier ... turn the heat up too high and you will burn the food and make a mess of the pan ... you will be sorry and cleanup will be a drudge.

No more nonstick pans for me except for frying eggs and maybe not even then.  This pan cooks even and browns up so much
better and I am so tired of babying the nonstick pans and still having to replace them every year or so and getting mediocre
results at best. These AllClad pans should last forever and be the last fry pans I ever have to buy. Highly recommended.",Great pans for Christmas,Best frying pan I've ever used

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

3991,"If you have never heard this album before, you have probably never heard anything like it before. Yes, it is an ""essential"" collector's recording, documenting a sea change in jazz studio work. And yes, Miles' ensemble here went on to become Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and some of the other seminal fusion bands. But this album is like nothing before or since.
Appreciation requires close, attentive listening. It is about the interplay of musicians and development of themes over 20 minute tracks. The sheer brilliance of the artists requests and requires our respectful attention. My focus shifts from listening to listening, but these days i am caught up in the interplay of drummers Jack DeJohnette and Lenny White. Other times i have marveled at Bernie Maupin's bass clarinet, or the interplay of three electric pianos, and of course Miles' guidance coming in the form of exquisitely phrased trumpet.

3992,"I love this cookware. I like that it is lightweight but cooks every bit as well my mother's heavier, 60yearold Revere Ware saucepan that I have been using since she passed away. Although some reviewers do not like the country of manufacture or the weight of the pans, I do not care about those factors if it functions well  and for me, these pots and pans function effectively. For the past three years, I had been using a large set of expensive, nonstick cookware. However, that cookware was heavy, took a long time to heat up, and did not stack well in my cupboard. I have wanted Revere Ware since I got married 39 years ago, and now that all my childlren but one have gotten married and moved out, I decided to treat myself. This Revere 7piece set, along with the 3qt. individual pan also available from Amazon, are my new favorites. My arthritic arms, wrists, and fingers are thanking me for going back to lighterweight cookware. The pans are small, but they are sufficient for my family of three, when supplemented with a large frying pan and soup pot that I already had. This Revere set stacks well in my cupboard. Of course they do not clean up as easily as nonstick, but that just is not a big deal for me. And, when the pans' copper bottoms need a shine, I coat them with ketchup and wait a while, and they become shiny again.

This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats. 2 Decent fiber content about 10Drunk or confused 3 18 !! amino acids 4 Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat. 5 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11 minerals more in trace amounts 6 Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids this is a good thing, phytosterols help lower cholesterol, and other healthy or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched phytochemicals.

This adds a subtle character to green tea plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips. The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.

4005,"I thought having the two parts to the case would be great, but it was too easy for the black/battery part to slip off from the blue/case part and lose the battery connection. And the battery performance itself was substandard. I could leave it charge overnight with the phone itself still mostly charged, and the battery case would be less than 50 charged in the morning. I found myself plugging the case/phone in during the day, every day. So I returned the case to Amazon because it does not perform nearly as well as described. I also found it difficult to hold in one hand due to the texture of the case. With every other case, I have been able to hold the phone in one hand for texting, Facebooking, etc. By way of comparison, my previous case was a PowerSkin. It lasted for over a year until I ripped the charging port loose oops. That was a onepiece case that kept my phone charged all day even with heavy usage. The only downside of that case compared to the Maxboost was that the PowerSkin created white spots or halos with flash photos. The Maxboost did not do that. The PowerSkin looks like it is been redesigned somewhat I can tell because the LED's are now on the backside instead of the bottom but I cannot tell if they still have the problem with flash photos. So I am getting a Mophie Juice Pack Plus as my next case, which is what all of my friends recommended. Much more expensive than a Maxboost, but the battery performance on this case is just too poor to make up for the cheaper price.

4022,"I have been a longtime and very frustrated Roxio user who, after crash 953, finally got fed up and decided to try the trial version of Sony Vegas Pro 8. Vegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higherend product than Roxio Easy Media Creator version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes, but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider: 1. First and foremost, if you are serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must. Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus. 2. The controls are far more intuitive. Creating a slowmotion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrlclicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length. Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits. 3. Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8. Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyperthread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time. Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride. 4. RENDERING. OH, YES, RENDERING. Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be rerendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG2 to start with. VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS if it is already in the right format, it will not ruin the quality by recompressing. 5. RENDER QUALITY. Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding. Period. Vegas Pro 8 offers 2pass variable bitrate encoding which allows longer videos to be placed on a DVD, while compressing it at a variable rate so that segments requiring","Recompressing and re-reading, but not enough to do it.",Why get anything else?

Mine came with no leaks of any sort, and was easy to attach. I think that with my heavy winter and spring use, the frequent flexing of the hose from my busy pump will create lots of wear on the hose, and so I intend to replace the hose with solid PVC again this summer, though I know from experience that my new PVC joints will eventually fail too. Water drainage needs lots of maintenance. UPDATE: we have had a big surplus of rainfall since I installed this hose as a short term replacement for PVC solid pipe.

4039,"Look, I know this will not be a very popular review due to the average rating so let me make this very clear: I love ancestry .com and am not saying this is bad software. I am merely saying it is an average deal. Here is why: the software user interface and capabilities are pretty similar to what you get with the online subscription.

I started online only and did not have this software last year. Once I tried the software I realized that they work almost the same way. You get the same tree, the same updates, and the same documentation options. But here is the difference: when you need to get some info the software takes you online anyway! So why do you need the software? You really only need it if you already have been using it and want to update your existing save files. There are some printing options as well.

The bottom line is that the price is what you pay for 6 months online access anyway so you may as well get the software. But you really are not getting much more than what you get online anyway.",Good software,Pretty Much the Same as Online at Ancestry

If you are buying this just be aware that this is not new, it is a rereleased port of a four year old PS2 fitness program. It is very good for what it is almost an interactive DVD workout you can customize. When I wrote the review, I knew it was being billed as a sequel to Yourself! Fitness, and I was very frustrated at buying the same thing I already owned. You still have to weigh yourself in Wii Fit or on a regular scale and hand enter your info in this program. I just do not understand why Ubisoft could not have modified the original game to take a weigh in from the balance board, and even utilized it on appropriate excercises. My review score is simply based off the lack of effort and laziness of Ubisoft. New Scores: For an interactive DVD workout: 4 out of 5. Ubisoft's effort on this port: 1 out of 5. Original text follows: This game is was actually released a few years back under the name ""Yourself Fitness"" for PS2, PC and Xbox about four years ago. For what it is, it was an excellent fitness program. This has a couple of added excercises, so you might call it an update, but it is really almost exactly the same. see it here [...] Just click on the video If you are expecting balance board software, stay clear. This is simply a customizable fitness DVD! You can tailor your routine to what aspect you want to focus on. You can use whatever normal fitness equipment you own, hand weights, steps, balance ball, etc into the routines.

The books do not have a reference  a way of ""framing""  the setting. Its Smiley, plodding through the past via convoluted conversations with exCircus people that take pages and pages to get through. The fact that it lacks ""action"" is not by itself bad, but combined with the lack of setting it makes for a tedious and in some parts miserable read.

4100,"Honestly, where do I start?! This keyboard blew me away! I was looking for a 10 keyless type of keyboard to use mainly for shooters, as my mouse would occasionally hit the numpad area of my current keyboard, but I was not sure if I would like having such a small keyboard. I tried looking for 10 keyless boards and simply found them too expensive for what they offered same price as full keyboards without back light. Also, most keyboards featured blue or black style switches, of which I would rather not use do to playing games on voip. I saw this board and its plethora of switch types, back lighting, all for a reasonable price. First impressions were stellar as it felt just like any premium mechanical board I had tried before, simply in a smaller form factor. Keys feel great so far, and while I am not sure if I will keep the reds or switch to browns, I do know I really like this board! My only real complaint, which is actually rather large, is that the instruction page included is not the most hopefully. My board had numlock turned on when I plugged it in and the ""windows key disable mode"" off, causing me to think my F12 key backlight was dead and also causing certain keys to register as if I was using a numpad did not notice the writing on the side of some keys as I was using this in the dark. Despite that initial scare, this board delivers while having a nice variety of key switches for those of us who do not simply want a blue equivalent.

She wants to prove she is more than her looks, that she can clean, cook, and be a workingclass wife, while he aims to give her everything that he can within his means and with his talent.

Although Beauty and the Blacksmith  is a novella, there is a little plot that was both mysterious and hilarious, very fitting for Spindle Cove because of the gossip, intrigue, and womendriven little town feel. While the ending was a little outrageous, it was cute and I still adored it. I squealed, laughed, and became lightheaded with characters in the scene. As always, Tessa Dare delivers sensual and sighprovoking romance with very real characters in exquisitely told settings and plausible situations. Definitely a mustread for fans of light forbidden romances between two characters who have secretly loved each other from afar.",A must-read for fans of light forbidden romances between two characters who have secretly loved each other from afar,A delightful novella with a perfect forbidden pair
4105,"Chose this based on previous experience with HP products being robust and reliable. And it seemed a good choice for about a week. Do not let it do HP updates, especially if you are using a browser at the same time. My daughter was working in Google Drive Chrome when she got an alert saying the laptop needed to install updates. Not Windows updates no, these were for the backup software HP puts on their machines, and the alert comes complete with orange exclamation points, to give it a sense of urgency. It was a legitimate update for those who think it was a malware issue. It is HP's ""helper"" applications. She okayed the update and went back to work. Or tried to. As soon as the install process got underway, the browser slowed and became unresponsive. She asked me to take a look. Chrome was frozen and would not close. Task manager would not open. The updates were also frozen. Then we saw the 'restart' image. We thought ""Good it will OK after restarting"" but it never restarted. The swirling 'restarting' graphic just stayed until the screen went dark. Power button remains lit, but the computer does not do anything.

5 Medical Alert Bracelets

 I so want to be Will and Patricks friend. I love this couple. I love this series. The holidays are always a stressful time, but mix in spending it with your husbands family that you just met. A mother in law that openly does not like you and is plotting to have her son get back with his former partner. An Uncle that is openly hostile. It all makes for craziness.
 The more time Will and Patrick spend together, the more their relationship blurs. No longer at odds with one another, the friendship is growing stronger and they are finding comfort in each other's company.
Now I have to wait to see what happens, but if New Year's Eve is any indication to what is going to happen, I am all in.

4125,"I love exotica music, and the whole tiki culture thing, it is tremendous fun. However I am afraid I am going to have to be the voice of reason on this one, since not all things that bear the name ""tiki"" means ""tiki"". Some of it is just hacked and slapped together. Some of the music on this work is really clever, and has potential. However, it is also quite shallow, repetitive, and bears the cheap plastic feel that only a synth can produce. After the music was run through the ""Enigma"" filter, the arrangements themselves bear no resemblance to the complex musical genius and prowess of the composers of the 50s/60s. This is extremely computer generated. And just when you start to hear something that shows promise, such as ""Pacifica 66"" or ""Palace of the Tiger Women"", and your ears perk up out of nowhere comes an ultra ridiculous laser ray gun sound or something else so utterly ridiculous that it shatters anything that would otherwise be useful for actual exotica mood setting or relaxation. It is like someone just scraped their fingers across a chalkboard in the middle of all the mellow as sort of an antagonistic joke or prank, or like trying to relax to something nice and a little kid comes running through the room with an annoyingly noisy toy. Is this comedic effect intentional? It has me scratching my head. The Tiki/Enigma thing could work, and probably well, but not Tiki/Scifi. I give credit to anyone who tries something new, but this one should have been easy to spot as downright goofy. ""Atomic age"" is a cool aspect of 50s/60s scifi culture, but it does not work when mixed with tiki/exotica, at least if this work is to be taken seriously. The two genres are",A little more clever than the other.,"""Oil and Water"" mix clearly not intended to be taken seriously"

4132,"After going back and forth between Chuggingtons and Thomas, we decided to go with Brio. The Over Under set from Chuggingtons was awful the train would always derail in the default layout and Thomas TV shows left us wanting something not licensed. I love this Brio set! It has a little bit of each of the smaller Brio sets, meaning you really do not need anything else to have a complete Brio experience other than it does not come with a motorized train. The one thing I did not think of when I bought into Brio is that the people can sit inside the train cars, which is a bonus. My only complaint is that sometimes the arms stick out funny in the motorized train and gets the train stuck on the bridge in the deluxe set.

I forgot to mention that we got this for our 20 month old last year for Christmas because we wanted to get him a train toy that would last his childhood  although the whole set was overwhelming at first, we pared it down and gave him more parts as he grew older.

It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?""

4141,"""A Power in the Blood"" wound up in my Kindle because it had five and four star reviews, and the sample chapters read well. In fact, the first 200250 pages were an interesting story of three orphaned children of the late 1 880's who were put on an Orphan Train from NY to the west. The idea was that they would be paraded before parents who were either childless or had suffered the death of a loved child and decided adopt.
Mr. Masters tells a wonderful story for the first third of his book. The characters of the Dugans were fully filled out so that we know them , their thoughts, emotions and actions bringing this reader's Attention to every page. Then, as new people were introduced into the narrative , the story began to get weird , even grotesque. To me it seemed that the author had started to write a western epic of the Larry McMurtry school, only to veer off into Stephen King territory.
Mr. Masters ladles out sexual depravity , psychotic killers, and a young child with a blue birthmark who has ""The Power."" Yet with all that going on, I found long chapters in which characters' inner thoughts rambled on and on and others filled with long descriptive passages that were simple boring. I found myself skimming through many such chapters. There was some good writing in the book, with the promise of an interesting family saga, but I was quite disappointed how badly the book went off into the Grande Guignol of excess.
Notes to readers: gore, with violence graphically described; sexual entanglements of nearly every possible mode; and a growing wonder if this family would ever be reunited before the bloodbaths engulfed them.

4142,"After researching several different models, we decided to go with the FD1018P and I am glad we did.

First of all, it is big.  The trays have more surface area than most others, it comes with more trays than most others and has a plenty of specialty tray liners.  The description talks about how the air is forced up the sides and into the center for consistent drying.  Yep!  We have run through several cycles of jerky, using all of the trays, and they are evenly dried from top to bottom and from the outside in.  Heck, they say you can stack up to 30 trays with this unit.  Yeah, I will take their word on that.

Drying times vary but here is an example of our last batch.  A 5lb top round roast, sliced about 3/16"", took a bit less than 10 hours to ""jerkify"".  The meat was marinated and patted dry.  It does not come with a timer to turn off but I cannot see how that would be needed.  Given the amount of variables that effect drying time I cannot see how a shutoff timer would work anyway.  Easy to setup, easy to use and easy to clean.  Cannot ask for more.

I am able to spray once and then I have to wait several seconds before I can spray again...if I can spray at all.  It has been completely clogged.  I tried heating the bottom of the bottle with my hair dryer and letting it sit in a bowl of warm water in hopes of loosening up the sediment.

This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the ""ghost dogs."" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house. Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or fleshandblood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Them's Emporium Moon Lake's general store, Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the ""hauntings,"" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail where he died. Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger. As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she is not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning she would, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!

4172,I really like this author.  I have read her other 2 books from a different series and loved them.  I love love polar bear shifter stories.  This was no exception.  Just loved it!  Quinn was definitely grumpy bear!  LOL.  Good reason for it though.  Loved Chloe and I felt really bad for her.  She needed a much needed break.  I thought it was great that after the way she was treated by her ex and used as a walking carpet when Quinn's grumpy butt said something he should not have she told him to get out.  HA.  I do think she should have given him the benefit of the doubt when he told her what he was.  It took a lot for him to open up because he has been damaged too.  Her of all people should have understood that.  Instead she throws it in his face and has a freak out.  All is well at the end though.  He makes her work for it as he should though.  Read on KU and I am going to buy it too because its a great story!,Then read this!,Polar Bears!!!!

4189,"I disagree with virtually all of the reviewers about this film. It was touted as a comedy and ""outrageously funny"". Well it was not overly funny and it made a real effort to be funny but the ""funny"" scenes were so obviously forced and so obviously dumb that they just came across as stupid. Finding a rental car is not that difficult and that is the basis for this movie. I cannot believe that anyone is as stupid as these people were supposed to be. Bullock is supposed to be a free spirit but she comes across as immature, undisciplined, and self absorbed. This was a total waste of talent and Affleck and Bullock did their best but why people of their abilities agreed to appear in this film is a mystery. I think what put me off of this film is it is totally unrealistic view of marriage. Of course these are all Hollywood types where any marriage lasting longer than a month is viewed as unusual. This film would have you believe that every marriage is at its core unhappy and that most people are divorced or adulterers. Men and women are unhappy with their partners and anyone who gets married should expect to be unhappy that is the message here, but it is also how most Hollywood types view marriage. Beyond that we have the usual Hollywood view that EVERYONE smokes Marijuana or takes drugs of some sort EVERYBODY DOES. Well I do not think so and I thought this film was simply not funny and I do not see anything humorous about being arrested for drugs. At no level was this film realistic and none of the actions were logical or believable imagine holding an outside wedding even though hurricane flags are flying is anyone really",The reason for this film is completely unrealistic view of marriage,Dysfunctional People

4198,"John Wayne leads an allstar cast in this riveting drama about the American Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wayne stars as Capt. later Admiral Rock Torrey. He is put in command of a ragtag fleet of ships to search for the Japanese fleet after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Kirk Douglas stars as Commander later Captain Eddington, Torrey's exec. officer. Torrey's fleet finds the Japanese and a huge battle ensues. A Japanese sub ends up putting two torpedoes into Torrey's ship, but the ship stays afloat. Nevertheless, Torrey is relieved of his command for failing to sail in a zigzag pattern. This sounds a lot like the saga of the USS Indianapolis. Torrey is sent to work behind a desk after losing his command. While ashore, he develops a relationship with Maggie Haynes Patricia Neal, a navy WAVE. He also tries to mend his strained relationship with his estranged son Jere Brandon De Wilde. Jere has developed a relationship of his own with a nurse named Annalee Jill Hayworth. Finally, after spending a considerable amount of time languishing behind a desk, Admiral Nimitz Henry Fonda gives Rock another chance. He promotes Rock to Rear Admiral and sends him back into the South Pacific as commander of one of the first amphibious operations of the war. Thanks to Rock's ingenuity and some help from his fellow officers, the operation is a success, but not without cost. I found this to be a very good film. The allstar cast is the strong point of the movie, with John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, Tom Tryon, Brandon De Wilde, Burgess Meredith, Carroll O'Connor, Henry Fonda, Jill Hayworth, and Paula Prentiss all giving fine performances. The battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the black and white backdrop of the film adds",Fantastic Drama,"One of ""The Duke's"" Greatest War Movies"

4222,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Great product!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

4242,"I am going to run down a list of jobs I did with these gloves.

1.  Chopped down a tree
2.  Dug out the stump.
2.  Thatched my yard to clear 20 years of debris from said tree that had never been cleaned up.
3.  Moved 1200 lbs of cinder blocks from the hardware store and then used them to create a stand for my water barrels.
4.  Moved over a ton of paver stones and then installing a paver area.  The sand bedding did a number on the gloves, but they persevered.
5.  Replaced some existing pavers that did not have an adequate footing or weed strip.
5.  Removed four bushes
6.  Painted my exterior trim.
7.  Sanded and repainted my front door.
8.  Laid down asphalt

The asphalt is what did them in.

Now I would probably not consider these professional gloves.  A professional landscaper would probably have to replace them at least once a month.  But you have to figure a total cost basis.  Work gloves wear out, and these are less than $10.

I like them for a few reasons.  When I first got them, they felt a little tight.  However, they did not hamper my manual dexterity much, and that made the tightness very easy to overcome.  They stretch just a little bit, and they maintained that stretchiness throughout the life of the gloves.

The fingertips eventually gave out probably because I was wearing them when prying at a lump of asphalt.  I think I got my $10 worth, and I will be ordering another pair.",I want to run down a list of jobs that get these gloves,Very solid value for a very flexible glove

4249,"This game could have been better, way better, then San Andreas, sadly, due to Microsoft's extreme cheapness as usual they only included a DVD ROM drive in their Xbox 360 console, and without a BluRay drive, 360 games are severely crippled. This game is so crippled it is not even funny. They have removed almost everything that made San Andreas great. You want a tank? Nope, no tanks. Want To fly around? Yea, you can do that, on your choice of two YES TWO, in the ENTIRE game helicopters. No planes, no fun items, no properties to purchase, no land to take over, no customization of any sort tattoos, clothes, hair, etc, no building up stats, no deserts, no jet packs, far far less weapons I believe there is a total of 12 in THE ENTIRE GAME, less vehicles, less places to go into, less things to do, a very short storyline I completed it in exactly one week, it took me about 2 years to finish San Andreas, and far more disappointments await you. Pretty much, game developers have two choices when developing for the 360, a good game with bad graphics or a game with good graphics and horrible gameplay, RockStar chose the latter. I am not trying to be a fanboy, I own a PS3 and there are many things I do not like about it particularly the restrictions on sub accounts but when it comes to a good high definition game, the PS3 is the only way to go. You cannot put an HD game on a DVD, just like you cannot put an HD movie on a DVD, it is time developers stop limiting themselves because of the 360. RockStar screwed up because the PS3 version is just a port of the 360 version. Perhaps",Great game on your Xbox 360,Horrible and extremely disappointing for a GTA game

Quality is excellent as is the quality of the pole which comes apart into two pieces.  Assembly is very easy although each flower like the blades of the wind mill need to be turn or bent at 30 degrees to create the angle to catch the wind so that the entire circle would spin.  Both sides of this double wheel will need to be treated this way.  It is very easy and there is a diagram.  Take care to do this correctly so that each wheel is bent correctly so when the unit is assembled and inserted into the ground, the two wheels will counter spin to create the best effect.  It is not hard at all but user should do this carefully.  The unit does take a nice draft to have enough energy to spin it.  It is quite nice looking when it does.

Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to resubscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hotoffthepress fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue: ""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" she is for it and it is in the Need to Know section of the magazine... ""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals"" ""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves"" ""Get Hit On All The Time"" ""Orgasm Whisperer"" ""First Time Sex Bloopers"" ""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game"" I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It is rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men...

4259,"I am not sure what it was about Crysis 3 that pretty much caused me to forget I ever played it within hours of seeing the end credits, but that is what happened. It is a bit baffling, really. The game itself is pretty cool. I adored the first game in the series. It remains one of my favorite first person shooters I have ever played. The second game was a big step down, but still different enough to be somewhat memorable, and was also a fun game. Crysis 3, despite trying to recall the lush open spaces of jungle and vegetation of the first game, feels much more like the more constricted, urban war zone that was Crysis 2. It is a fun game. The shooting is meaty and satisfying, the nanosuit is always fun to use, and the newly added bow and arrow gives the game a nice boost to stealth that surpasses even the first two games. It is a gorgeous game to look at, even on the ancient PS3, and the sound design is fantastic. Yet in the end, Crysis 3, much like Crysis 2, feels more like a modern tech demo than it does a heartfelt video game. Maybe it was because I played this game so soon after the masterful and amazing Metro: Last Light, but I never really felt anything other than superficial, inthemoment enjoyment while I played this game. Nothing about it really left a mark, make me think, or intrigued me in any way. The game does not really introduce anything new to the genre, while at the same time it really does not do much wrong either. I think I am just at the point where I am expecting more out of the games I play. Video games have become",a bit boring,"A fun, well-made shooter that ultimately left me feeling hollow"

4266,"It is a good inexpensive rack. I bought this because my weight room is relatively small unlike my biceps lol and I needed to make the plates more accessible. Prior to this I stored all the plates on the sides of my bench so when I wanted to use them for barbell curls or whatever I would have to crawl over the bench to one side, remove the weights from the single holder till I got the one I wanted, and crawl back across the bench. It was more annoying than anything else. Now I keep this rack in the center of the room so I can quickly grab a plate when needed. The only issue I have with the product is sometimes the 5lb and 10lb plates will touch so when I grab a 10lb plate it will slightly pull the 5lb plate up the holder. I mean, it is not a big deal, just a little noisy. Maybe my plates are not perfectly round, who knows.

My only complaint is that the fit could be just a little better, and that they are a little smashed up when they are fresh out of the box.  It will take a while before they return to their proper shape once installed.

4272,"These amazing speakers have a lowend rattle ""wheeze"" somewhere around 50Hz. My first test with these speakers was to pull up some 808 patches in Reason and see how the iLoud's handle the low end. I would call it a complete failure. My first immediate reaction was: these must be blown.

I am not expecting fullpower accurate sound at sub levels from these little guys but with their claimed high tech crossover technology I expect something that is controlled, clean, and professional. I shined a flashlight into the 3 inch driver to see if it was torn. It looked just fine.

Dead on except the very last angle where it read 0.05 degrees off from the miter hard stop angle. Do not know which is incorrect but 0.05 degree error is too small to care about in woodworking unless you are building something 100's of feet long.  Next I zeroed it on the bed of my table saw and then stuck it on the blade. Adjusted the blade for perfectly vertical and then set the angular scale to zero.

4308,"Martin Rosen had adapted Richard Adams' ""Watership Down"" in 1978 so this was a natural followup. The animation is sharper and more complex and the story translates well to the screen. It is a bittersweet and depressing tale, but significant for all. Just like ""Watership Down,"" ""Plague Dogs"" is not a kid's movie. Although it might not be as viscerally graphic as ""Watership Down"" it is probably the more disturbing film with some of its themes, imagery, and implications. It is a very mature cartoon. If you liked the book you will be happy.
MY COMPLAINT is that the full British cut seems to be unavailable in the United States. While this American edit does not cut out enough to screw up the storyline, it does throw off some of the character development and the pacing. There are so many small character moments that are lost and several scenes will feel slightly truncated...because they are. The film is still great, but I know it is even better than this.",Really disturbing movie,Good stuff from Rosen/Adams
4309,"I am not sure I am going to do these brushes justice with my review. I always had my doubts about the clarisonic brush and its cleaning capabilities. However, I got these brushes and decided to take the plunge and purchased a Mia Fit from my local sephora with a 20 off coupon. There are four brushes which I will outline below with what they are, what they do and how I feel about them.

Cashmere Cleanse Luxe Brush  cleanse while increasing hydration in the skin  I am honestly surprised that this brush did make my skin feel more moisturized and less dry and flaky.

Radiance Brush  Refresh Dull Skin to reveal softer, smoother, more radiantlooking skin  This was a soft but a bit more firm then then sensitive brush head. My skin felt clean and soft after using this brush.

Deep Pore Brush  Helps minimize the appearance of pores  I use this one on Sunday's when I do a hair mask and other longer beauty things. The bristles are soft but much more firm then other brushes. This one is a bit more rough on my skin and that is why others may be able to use it more often.

Sensitive Brush  Cleanse Gently yet effectively, for all skin types  This brush works great for everyday use  sometimes twice a day due to workouts, swimming and other outdoor ""dirty"" activities when I feel like I need to clean my face.

This is a great set and once my brushes start to wear out, I will buy this set again to replace them.",Good brush for all skin types,Great set of brushes to keep your skin looking amazing!

I would highly recommend this for any kid and honestly any adult who is into this sort of thing.

Had to wait a few months for shipments from the manufacturer.  Have not had a chance to use it yet the chop saw is at my daughter's house for a deck project.  Assembly was a breeze and mounting of the saw was also easy.  The exception was the 45mm x 6mm bolts that attached the saw mounts to the rail system were cheap and the heads would shear off with very little torque.  I could not trust them.  Replaced them with 50mm x 6mm bolts from Home Depot they did not have 45mm long bolts but the 50mm worked fine.  I talked to Bosch and they were kind enough to send me out a new set of hardware but I did not want to wait a week so I bought the longer bolts.

4321,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent.",Very easy to use,Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning
4322,"This really is a fantastic delay, I played in guitar center and listened to it on youtube and it seemed very ""ambient"" and pleasing, and in person it about fits the same bill. The texture is very organic to my ears, and fills space without clogging up the guitar's signal. My grippe, and after reading other comments it may be what the pedal is designed for, but to me the ""mod"" button seems almost useless, I find that it boosts the top end frequencies, but at the same time it thins out the bottom end frequencies so it just sounds less full. I have used other delay pedals with ""mod"", and this one is still better than most, but it stumps me why even have it when it is effect minimal, and what I found was it is VERY difficult to use without getting the ""seasick"" tone. Overall though, even with the modulation being questionable, this pedal I believe if is not true bypasss, it fools me, I tested with and without being plugged in to the pedal and straight to my amp, and I never heard any differences in my original signal with the pedal off. Also, if you dial back the ""mix"" to about 9'of the clock, you can use it in front of an amp with high gain and it acts like a ""tape echo"", it is pretty cool that it is pliable to your guitars gain, and still sounds good. That said I think after 9 of the clock, the pedal may start to filter in gain that increases the pedals signal, and if your playing straight into an amp this will ""fight"" your preamps gain, so if you have that issue you can just turn down the mix knob and it will sit very well",Very incredibly good pedal,"Best Delay I've Ever Heard, Questionable Modulation Function"

4327,"""Merry, Merry Ghost"" is the second appearance of the ghost sleuth Bailey Ruth, who first showed up in Ghost at Work Bailey Ruth Mysteries, No. 1 which I also enjoyed. This is a light book with little to hold it back as a quick and fun read.

Since this the second in the series, you may already know that Bailey Ruth does not squarely fit in as the ideal heavenly employee in her department assigned to help those still living, but she does things her own way and often with humorous results. The pace is a little uneven at first, but does move alone nicely as the story heats up.

This is not a deep mystery or a serious supernatural thriller, but simply a fun diversion that both my wife and I enjoyed reading. Recommended for fans of the genre!

Keurig B70 is very easy to use yet has many options. It is very easy to fill and load the water container and the coffee does not get any easier than just having to pop in a gourmet single cup or one you have filled with your favorite coffee and close it.

My daughter loves ice tea and the Keurig makes her a glass just as easy as making a cup of coffee. With other coffee makers my main complaint has been the pot of remaining coffee will taste bitter and burnt within a couple of hours. I would always end up dumping it. Or the carafe like the Barista has, soon it would be cold and the coffee dumped. With this maker it is one cup at a time and it is the coffee choice you want.

4336,"I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15foot dryer duct run. It is just not the type of thing that is at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be rewritten and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here is my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise not reverse mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you are screwed. 5. Read 4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

There are 50 feet, so this one box has been lasting me a long time. it is not extremely absorbent, but will certainly catch small spills before they head onto the floor. There is also a bit of cushion to it to help keep a dropped glass item from breaking. The underside is polyurethane and helps keep the liner in place instead of slipping around across the counter. It also keep spills from soaking all the way through, thus protecting your surface from undesirable liquids. I use this liner at home for my kids' science experiments and crafts and it is the best solution I have found for containing the mess.",This liner is the best!,Great liner to absorb small spills and protect counters

4341,"About a year and a half ago, I bought two of these Comfort seats.  Installation was unbelievably easythe bolts tightened up right away and stayed tight. Fit was perfect.  Wood finish was excellent to begin with and has remained that way.  Stainless screws are the right material for this application.  The chrome has tarnished a bit over time, but it cleaned up nicely with NevrDull metal polish.  In sum, the seats look about as good now as they did when they came out of the box.

Two minor problems.  First, the hardware that came with the seats was not the same as illustrated in the instructions.  The manufacturer's website has the same obsolete instructions.  That leaves the question of how to sequence the washers.  Please see Kris M.'s accompanying Amazon.com review for the answer.

Second, after a year and a half, one of the nylon nuts cracked and dropped off.  I was able to quickly improvise a repair using a hex nut.  Then I emailed the manufacturer about the broken nylon nut.  Got an immediate and courteous response that a replacement part would be shipped the same day.  It arrived two days later.  I appreciate that the manufacturer's customer service is on a par with the high quality of the product.  With the OEM part the seat is as good as new.

In sum, these toilet seats are highly recommended.  It seems to me that the people who put so much thought and quality into this product would deserve the Nobel Prize for Toilet Seats if there were such a thing.

Followup, 2016. The Comfort seats I purchased over five years ago are still going strong.  The chrome has tarnished, but otherwise the seats are as good as new.","The chrome has tarnished, but otherwise the seats are as good",Superior Product

4345,"I have an old car!! a recently acquired 98 Ford Contour, which only has a radio cassette player, only 1 power port! So I bought this to add the extra ports, but also to hook up my cell phone via bluetooth when I am driving. I was very surprised at how well this operates!! While it does have some static when I am playing music, I hardly notice it! I do hear it if I do not have any audio source playing, but it is not too bad. It works very well for my cell calls, having a nice clear sound, ones who call me say they hear me just as well. I really like the long cord from the adaptor to the unit. I can move it anywhere I need to, to accommodate other items I plug into the extra ports. Plus, it gets the unit further away from the radio, reduces the noise a bit, from being in to close proximity. I learned about this from other reviews I have read here. So, I am very pleased with this product. In the two months I have been using it, I have not had any problems. I use it to play music, other audio from my cell phone, including gps directions, am pretty impressed at the sound quality through the car's old stereo radio!! Overall, for the price, all of the features, I am very satisfied with this unit. I would recommend it for anyone who needs Bluetooth capability, along with the extra power ports!!

Dealing most significantly with the inner child, and the  revelations that can free us, the book and the film successfully engage you  with a rich sense of time and place.  The characters who populate the film  sometimes seem from two different worlds, but I think that is part of the  point.  Kate Nelligan and Jason Gould will surprise you with unusually good  performances, and of course, Nick Nolte does some of his best acting ever  in this film  the role suits him; even its grander touches seem so  so   Tom.

The fact that you can take it off and adjust it if you do not put it on perfectly straight the first time is very helpful as I am normally horrible at putting these things on my phone. Once I had it on, I only had one either bubble or speck of dust in the bottom section which you cannot even really see since I have the white iphone. I have noticed that with a case on the phone, it does sometimes push up the corner or around the sides of the screen protector. It is slightly annoying but since my case is a snug fit I guess it is expected. I heard they make screen protectors that are slightly smaller for when you have a case on there and I would probably try to get one of those next time.

I would definitely consider ordering this same screen protector brand again. I think the wet apply way is the easiest and eliminates some of the stress of putting one on the phone.",Great screen protector,Great Screen Protector
4365,"I have been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally.

Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1yearold Dell Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberryS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista. But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new or improved features it offers. Here is a list of my favorites: 1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they are indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you are using, as well as other computers you are networked with. In a home setting, where you are running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server. When coupled with Offline Files Folders a features that the nonHome editions of Windows offers since Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, you can easily take your server data with you, even when you are in a disconnected state. Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you are searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you have added to your library.

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush  the ""Marco method"" if you are new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it  you will not regret it, and provides a good, close, irritationfree shave.

The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses  fresh cut grass.

I was given the opportunity to order this palette free of charge by Amazon, give it some testing and post my opinion on this product. My research of this palette and makeup line entitled .THEM by Michelle Phan, brought up that it was manufactured by L'Oreal cosmetics.

The Large main pallet and accompanying smaller travel compact which accompanied as a gift are really well made and protective of the various circles of product, I am thinking that the white background of the palette lead me to that initial conclusion. Although the white most probably allow's the user to better access the makeup color's, a darker, brown or black background would have visually given the palette a richer more lux appearance as well as fought the messy residue look the white can take on.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I am knocking off a star because of the history of issues I have had with the program in previous years like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then reentered them. However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed Mac is only 330MB. Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes last year it was over 1GB. How inefficient we have become!

4416,"This stuff is truly amazing, My 12 week year old mixed puppy Pitbull/Labrador was having a small inflammation/irritation in her ears. She had small red spots on the inside of her ear and a small pimple above her right eye that the vet noticed. The vet mentioned the potential of steroid treatments long term. I rushed home from the vet appointment and immediately started researching all natural products for dogs with allergies. I was trying to figure out what was causing her allergic reaction. Could it be the detergent, the material frm her bed, the material from her toys, her blanket, the carpet, the cleaning products.....the list went on and on in my head.  WHA LAH! I found ResQ. I used a Qtip just to apply the cream on the inside of her ears and the tips of her ears right before bedtime. When I woke up in the morning, the inflammation was gone. I mean like magic.....I actually recall myself saying ""Omg, I cannot believe it"",I recommend this product to anyone with dogs who have allergies. It is all natural and it really works people!!... keep in mind that a little goes a long way so you do not need much in order to get the job done.

Dragon  Digital River should give seminars on horrible customer service.

First Digital River never sent me the physical shipment.  Either they or Dragon calls me once every couple of months to sell me what I already bought, and I tell them I never received it, and of course, they do nothing.

Then I get my new IMac, so I want to set up all the software.  For regular Apple software, is amazingly easy, and took less than 10 minutes of actual work for all Apple products although some downloads took some elapsed time.

Dragon Dictate wasted almost 90 minutes of my time on the phone, and I will not get the software for another 24 hours.  Ridiculous.

They KNOW I bought it and did not get it.  They initially said they cannot do a digital download, and now they said they can, but it will take 24 hours.  I had to wait and wait and wait on the phone, then speak to 2 people from some foreign land who do not understand enough English to know the simple problem even when I have order numbers and emails in front of them.

4437,"Snow Leopard may look the same as Leopard on the surface, but the more you use it, the more you realize just how comprehensive and powerful an update it is! From the initial installation, you will notice that your Mac is snappier and if you look at the space on your hard drive, you will see that installing Snow Leopard has freed up more than a few gigabytes of space. As you go about your normal workflow, you will start to stumble onto things that are just well better. I will give you one example. I decided that I wanted to relocate my iTunes Library, but that I did not want it to take an entire drive. I have several 1TB externals, and one looked tempting. But it was formatted with a single partition. I did a brief search in the Mac help section and was delighted to find that I am no longer stuck with static partitioning on formatted drives. In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions. With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step. In disk utility, I can select the ""partition"" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be! Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple. This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish. And Snow Leopard is full of such ""Aha!"" moments. A great update to an already great",A very powerful update to the entire Mac,"Full of little ""Aha's!"""

A slave girl's beautiful owner is captured by a soulless vampyre.  Facing being auctioned she goes to where her mistress had been taken and waits.  Eventually this beautiful but frigid boy comes and takes her to his palace as a servant to his wives, all of which used to be women but since he sucked out their souls are now wasting away so that she can not even tell which one is her mistress.  But she falls in love with the vampyre and escapes to try to find a way to free her mistress and maybe the vampyre who had once been a boy but was stolen by a witch.
Through much travel she comes upon powerful magic, befriends strangers, learns the true origins of her people, befriends monsters, and meets her vampyre's evil full grown brothers. Throughout the books she hunts down and fights this witch who is trying to destroy her world and lives many other adventures along the way.

The computer recognized the GPS unit, however it could not find any satellites in comparison the Garmin sitting next to it was finding 10 satellites. I contacted Microsoft and through remote access the tech did the following. I asked him to send it in an email to me so I could provide it here. Following are the steps we did Step 1: Click on START and then click on RUN. In the RUN box, type MSCONFIG and click on OK. Step 2: Under System Configuration, click on Selective Startup, and uncheck the following items... Process System.ini file Process Win.ini file Load Startup Items Then click on the tab SERVICES and check the option Hide all Microsoft Services. Then click on DISABLE ALL and the click on APPLY and CLOSE. When prompted to, restart the PC and try Streets and Trips with the GPS, it should work. Once it Starts working, repeat Step 1 above, and then switch back to Normal Startup, apply that change and click on CLOSE. That will get the computer back to normal. Now, try Streets and Trips with the GPS again, and it should be working, with the PC in normal mode. Once this was done the GPS did pick up satellites. However, when actually using it on the road the connection was dropped and picked up once every few minutes, then every time it would pick it up it would recalculate the trip again. After speaking again to the tech he told me that it might be that the USB ports are not powered enough. He got this information from another tech and sounded unsure about it.

4481,"I do not know where to start....NIN were one of the first Industrial bands I got into and not to mention one of the first heavier bands I began to love when i was about 13. I was quickly drawn to the sheer brilliance and atmosphere Trent Reznor created with his music. Alot of people, myself included, were introduced to NIN with the classic song ""Closer"" which sadly is the the only song most ""cool"" people buy this album for. From ""Mr Self Destruct"" to the tragic closing track, ""Hurt"", this album perfectly paints a dark gloomy atmosphere tinged with rust and decay that will pick away at the darkest parts of your mind. A concept album dealing with depression, drugs, sex, and suicide, The Downward Spiral may very well just be Reznor's best work to date, aside from how many copies it sold and all that silly horsesh, this cd will blow you away. It got me through some really tough times in my life, as I am sure it has with every other NIN fan on Earth. Every track is nothing short of spectacular, even the often accused filler, ""Big Man With A Gun"" come on...it is such an awesome song.

4487,"Alone in the dark was different for me, as I have never played any other in the series. I was expecting something much different since I played the Wii version before, which sucked. Gameplay Playing the game involves some cool puzzles, but some areas are frustrating! one are I spent around an hour on even though it lasted only a few minutes, it was the first major driving scene. One interesting aspect is that the standard enemies I saw them called humanz in a walkthrough can only be killed by fire with the stronger ones requiring more fire introduced before dying. The driving aspect of the game is cool, as the physics are not the most realistic, but that is not really a bad aspect of a game which most of the game is spent on foot. The game is different from other survival horror games because you get more than enough ammo, so you can be creative shooting doors apart when you do not have time for example. The healing system is cool, I like the difference from when it is a small wound or a bleeding one which can only be treated with the rare bandage, and you leave a blood trail which attracts monsters. The 3rd person cam is almost impossible to use, so I go to my preferred view of first person. Graphics Not the best, but they are good enough for me to get an easy grasp on the world around me, and also good enough to look into detail on objects. The fire does not look the best, but we have been spoiled with games like Far Cry 2 and such both games have fire which spreads realistically, but Far Cry has better graphics, being newer. Features items play a large role in this","Great Gameplay, but not great","Good, with a few setbacks, but still a great game."

4496,So I loved Shattered dimensions. I found it to be a lot of fun and engaging. It was not as good as Arkham Asylum but it was an excellent game in its own right. With all of that love for that game I preordered this game. Big Mistake. This time around there are just so many problems. 1 Story makes no sense at all and quantum causality really? So to show you that your choices in the past matter as you complete certain tasks it will change the future. By erasing minions and obstacles from existence in the past and clearing it for the future. Go rent Bill Teds Bogus Journey and when the are in the final faceoff against their opponent in that movie you will see exactly how silly this game mechanic is. Bogus Journey will also be a better way to spend your time if you are interested just in story. 2Camera angle. The camera will straight up kill you in this game. you will never see all of your opponents clearly. There are many games that have bad camera angles this is just another one. You must love the random enemy that you can not see but is killing you quickly but moves from where the shots came from to an equally unseen corner again. 3Advanced fighting difficulty. So if you are not a casual gamer this is not such a big issue. But more enemies who are faster and knock you out of specials and combos make this much less rewarding. This is where this game is suppose to shine and they made it harder to the detriment of most people who want to play and see what they can do. The game goes from being fun and challenging to being a grind. 4Boring visuals.,"Good game, but still a great way to spend your time in the past",Massive misstep

Michael John Grist has turned the zombie theme upsidedown. He has given his zombies an important role to perform. He has introduced unexpected elements to the postzombieapocalypse concept that should scare the cp out of you. In my case, after reading a book in this series, I absolutely have to satisfy my fix by getting and reading the next one.
The characters live and breathe on the pages. OK, Amo is a bit annoying with his secondguessing of decisions he has made, but he is exactly the right person to lead the band of survivors through a land of violence and evil.
There is a bonus in that you will find it a pleasure to get to know a bit about the author, as well

4512,"Despite the fact that it becomes repetitive and is occasionally glitchy and downright fugly I am looking at you, Unreal Engine and development deadlines tied to movie releases, I have to give this game props for being so full of overthetop, kickbuttery that you cannot help but become enthusiastic about it. The hours will fall away as you rend your foes limb from limb using one of the most iconic comic book characters ever in his BEST video game incarnation, bar none. The game moves breathlessly from one exciting setpiece to the next, consistently rewarding the player with cool upgrades and improved brawling prowess that the ""just one more level"" mindset is unavoidable.

I for one, cannot wait for a sequel from this same development team that is NOT tied to a movie release.

NOTE: It is been said in other reviews but it bears repeating  this is not a kid's game. The brutality and gore is very strong and made even this aged reviewer say, ""Whoa!"" more than once, usually when Wolverine would put his claws through someone is head and then rip said head from torso in slow motion.","The game is so full of overthetop, kickbuttery that you can't help but become enthusiastic about it",My thoughts on X-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged Edition

It begins promising with a nice madrigal rendering of 'Because', but soon most of the other songs are mixed with too much psychedelic noise so that for instance the steady beat of 'Get Back' gets lost completely in noises that are totally irrelevant. I prayed the Lord that at least the beautiful 'Eleanor Rigby' would be the original recording and thanks Heaven it was. Only a few other songs there are 20 songs like 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' are also the original recording.

You get the feeling that this CD is a mere potpourri of Beatles songs. The only positive thing is that the remix is very well done in so far that you have the feeling to stand between The Beatles while they are singing.
So far for the quality of this recording. The philosophy of the producers George Martin and Giles Martin. seems to be that The Beatles are a symbol for the psychedelic late 60's and early 70's and they seem to ignore the fact that The Beatles had their greatest successes in the mid 60's like for instance the above mentioned 'I Want To Hold Your Hand.'

Not really finding what information I needed, after spending a considerable amount of time searching amazon.com, I went to the Motorola website to attempt to gain definitive information. I started with the information on the battery in the VE465: SNN5813B, BT50, 20090321, 910mAh, 3.7Vcc. I found a lot of choices on amazon.com however the 910mAh was the stumbling block. Usually, a battery of the proper size with greater mAh is okay. Unfortunately, many of the choices on amazon.com had a mAh capacity of far less than the the one in the phone. The search for the BT50 gradually changed to a BT51 but I was still unsure. The reason was I did see some of the choices claim the BT51 was a replacement for the BT50 however the VE465 was not listed.

However, no matter how tight I had the harness fitted or how small a size I bought he always found a way to wiggle out of it. I asked around at dog boutiques about what I could buy instead that would be harder for my dog to wiggle out of and this product was recommended. Overall I really like this product. My dog has not been able to wiggle out of it even when running and jumping. He also does not seem to mind it. It does not keep him from walking normally and when left to wear it he does not try to chew it off like other harnesses. It also looks much more attractive and fashionable than other harnesses on the market. There are only a couple of downsides to this collar. The first is durability. I have only had it a week and one of the prongs has broken off the buckle. It still seems to secure okay and I am not tremendously concerned because the buckle is not at a point where a lot of pulling is happening. However, I am shocked that it has not lasted so long. The other thing worth noting is that this harness does NOT prevent pulling like some of the other harnesses on the market. It is still a great option if you want an alternative to a leash alone to avoid pulling on the dog's neck. However if pulling is a serious problem you may want to consider something else. However like I said the one harness I tried that did prevent pulling was also way too easy for my dog to get out of.

It takes a lot of guts, especially in his position of being a Senator, to come forth with such unflinching honesty on the horrors he suffered as a child. Most victims of such circumstances wind up as drug addicts, alcoholics and abusers themselves; Scott Brown became a basketball player, a model, an officer of the National Guard, a loving husband and father and not least, a YOU.S. Senator. One thing Senator Brown recognized, that few do, having come from his backgrounTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry he used the horrific experiences to shape and base his self, standards and method of living in, subsequently, the most positive of ways. He understands how adversity can make you a stronger person; those who have it easy just do not realize that powerful emotions and motives can serve to create a person OF personal power. Though and this is important he harbors no bitterness or grudges against those who wronged him, he got, ultimately, the best revenge: by doing superbly well in life. True, there are incidences and behaviors by his parents and socalled stepfathers that are difficult to assimilate and heartwrenching to read, but Senator Brown refuses to martyr himself or excessively dramatize in a sordid manner. The element I really enjoyed the most, though, was Scott's description of his personal boyhood world, the environment in his midst that he reenacted in wonderful, vivid detail. His moves, his actions, his thoughts as they were then, all eloquently, thoughtfully put across. I feel like referring to Senator Brown as just Scott: he is a scant 3 years older than I am, and he sounds exactly like a buddy I might have hung out with from school.

4617,"Monster is known for good quality cables but also for being pretty expensive, so I was suprised to see that these cables were only running $20 for 12 ft. and $25 for 21 ft.

I did not bother looking at them at Guitar Center as I just thought, I am sure they are nice but I will not even bother looking at the price. The sales rep recommended them when I asked about some quality cables and told me about their lifetime guarantee. I am tired of cables going on the fuzz and having to buy new ones only 23 yrs. after purchase so after seeing the price, I went for it.

End result, they work perfectly. I was having some buzz and noise from my older cables but that is all gone now. The Monster cable sounds clean and clear. No more background interference.

If you will notice from the picture, Monster wisely chose to cover the bottom of the plug with a nice rubber cover. No more of those metal covers that unscrew, allowing dirt and dust to get in there. Those things caused alot of trouble for me over the years and I am glad to not have to mess around with them anymore. The blue stripe is one of a few different color bands, which are included, that you can use to color code your cables with. So you can color each one for each purpose. Good feature.

I like this cable and it is good to know that it will be replaced for free forever under normal use and wear and tear. I have stayed away from Monster for home theater as their audio/video cables are outrageously over priced. But for playing guitar, I think I have my new brand.

4620,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

4627,"I loved FFTL's last cd Dear Diary, and have heard countless people say how much better it is than Heroine. I, however, disagree. Heroine and Dear Diary are almost impossible to compare because they are so different it is almost hard to tell that it is the same band. Heroine makes Dear Diary seem very poppy in comparison, as this cd is much darker and moodier, with stronger vocals and more original melodies. Granted, FFTL's overall sound is not all that unique, but Sonny Moore's haunting vocals screaming out against heavy guitar riffs and even accompanied by opraish vocals in the last two songs make for an incredable cd. In my opinon, the best songs are World War Me, Shame Shame, Waves Goodbye, Heroine, and Mothersound. My least favorite song is The Crows are Coming for Us, but besides that all the songs are fantastic and I would reccomend it for anyone.

Side note to any concerned parents looking at this album for their kids: Heroine is one of the only albums you can get in this genre that contains NO curse words except in the first two songs Mothersound and The Latest Plauge. The lyrics contain no negative or inappropriate subject matter and all in all this cd is appropriate for kids of all ages except for the first to tracks that use [...] a couple of times.","A very strong and sappy, but without any negative or inappropriate subject matter",My favorite CD of this year by FAR.

convenient  this widget does lack the groove in the rubber

4663,"KitchenAid is known for it is quality products and these pans are no exception. They spread the heat very evenly  and even on my older stove where some of the burners are not totally level, these seem to still cook pretty evenly. The handle, despite being metal and uncovered, does not heat up either. Though there is a little bit of weight to these, I was actually surprised they were not heavier. I have had similar pans in the past that weighed more, so points on that front as well.

My typical test for how sticky pans are is scrambled eggs, since I do not use butter for them first. With the smaller of the two pans, I scrambled up the eggs and poured them right in the heated pan, and nope, no sticking. Cleaning up afterwards was easy as well  the usual sticking to the rivets on the interior but otherwise, the left overs came off easily. The packaging indicates rinsing with cold water on the hot pan before things stick, and I tried both that way, and the lazy way of eating and coming back later to clean up. Of course the first way made cleaning easier, but even letting things cool first before tackling it did not make it too difficult to get the egg leftovers off.

The nonstick aspect of these pans is also on the outside edges, so the stuff that dribbles down the sides comes off easily as well. Bonus!

4670,"I read this book in less than two days and can understand why so many other reviewers here found this book lacking compared to previous Stone Barrington novels. Perhaps they are right and Stuart Woods is slipping. However, while this book certainly is not a great novel, it also does not deserve a 1 star rating, either. Fans of Stuart Woods need to remember that Stone Barrington was created by the author as SOMETHING OF A CARICATURE. Several installments back, Mr. Woods even commented in one of his afterwords that readers had commented on Stone's sluttish behavior. He stated somewhat tongue in cheek that he tried to tone Stone's behavior down but Stone just would not toe the party line. In any case, these books are light reads and should not be confused with Tolstoy or Dickens. WORST FEARS REALIZED is just another fast paced read in the continuing saga of Stone Barrington and his upper crust NY friends. This book has it all: Stone bedding one gorgeous woman after another, lots of money, Mafia dons, released psychopaths hunting Stone and Dino Bachetti and killing their friends. This is a quick easy read and I found it entertaining. I laughed a lot at some of the funny lines that Woods gives his characters to deliver. Give the guy a break! Mr Woods has written over 21 books. How many of the critics here at Amazon have done that? How many readers could craft even the worst of his efforts and turn it into a bestseller? I defy any of the other 44 reviewers who submitted reviews before me to do so.

The game loads easily  no need for an internet connection.  I did install the latest patch before playing.  The graphics can be adjusted higher than the default that it starts with.  In over 100 hours of playing I experienced 2 freezes and 1 crash.  Other reviewers have complained about quests that did not ""finish"".  Since I never try to complete every quest that was not a problem for me.

The game is very much in the style of the first KOTOR.  Select male/female, a few faces and hair styles, create a name, assign values to attributes, skills, etc.
There is a nice variety of environments and a good variety of followers.  select any 2 at one time as your companions  The designers did not try to reinvent the whole game, they just made a few improvements.  I especially liked being able to preset two weapon sets for each character and then just hitting an icon to switch.
The card game and swoop racing are back as nice diversions.  There are several points in the game including the very beginning where you are controlling a character or 2 or 3 other than your own.  That was a lot of fun.

The game is very well balanced between exploring, fighting, and conversing.  My only real complaint is there is way too much loot.  That is true of almost all rpg's including the first KOTOR.  By the end, you just click on stuff without bothering to read what it is.

I would recommend the game to anyone who likes classic role playing.  I wish they would make another one in the same style.",Still a good game,A worthy sequel to the original KOTOR

4686,"I heard all the hype about tinkyada pastas and did a taste test between the tinkyada brown rice spiral and the orgran rice spiral  also brown rice.

My results were very disappointing.

The tinkyada took like 20 minutes to cook, the orgran took 7 minutes.

Tinkyada had a very gummy mouthfeel, the orgran spiral had a clean mouthfeel and a nice texture  after only 7 minutes in the water.

I made the tinkyada pasta using both sets of cooking directions on the package, same result  very disappointing.

4688,"When I was in the 10th grade I read Anne Rices Interview with the Vampire in one week. Please keep in mind that for a fourteen year old, one week was like two days. My love for Rice and her writing only intensified as I continued along with The Vampire Chronicles, and The Mummy will forever remain in my top ten list of favorite books. However, as the years continued, I found that Rice's novels were either a major hit or a major miss. I still consider myself a huge fan, so imagine my surprise when I learned that Rice was going to return to the Brat Prince/Lestat and continue his story. Around the world vampires are being massacred after a voice known as the Voice commands it. Selfimmolation is implied, but it is written that the older vampires can tolerate the bidding of the Voice, Lestat included, but the younger fledglings are bearing the brunt of the fires. Surviving vampires, in a panic because of a lack of leadership, are desperate for a leader and who better to return from a selfimposed exile than the Brat Prince himself, Lestat de Lioncourt. There were moments in the book that I completely loved, but there were others that completely bored me. Sure, I had high expectations because I was going to be reunited with old friends that I had first become acquainted with over twenty years ago. Rice did a fantastic job with incorporating such old characters with modern society. Many of these vampires have iPhones, listen to the radio, and take advantage of the luxuries technology provides. My beloveds were there, but then with the introduction of new characters I began to become a little disenchanted. Some of the new characters were indeed interesting, but I found myself skimming through","I was not a fan of Rice's book, but decided to revisit it",one week was like two days

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it does not have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop. Okay, I am reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it. Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7. After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up. It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all. I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed. Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates. I also had only one choice to chooseInstall Windows 10. They did not even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months. Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day. When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.

Installation was easy, although the first thing KIS 2011 did was check for a more recent version of itself, which I downloaded before I installed anything. Nice to be up to date. Upon completing installation, I manually updated the virus definitions. I am sure the program would have done it automatically given time, but I wanted to update them right away, so I did it manually. The program has a very clean and organized interface. Finding what you need is fast and easy. A big green button let us you know you are safe and protected. Alternatively, if something is amiss this button will be yellow or red so you can easily tell the state of your protection. I was also impressed with how configurable KIS 2011 is.

4703,"I received a free copy of the book in exchange for a review. I liked this 35 chapter book. It was told through Carlotta's first person pointofview. Beware of a woman scorned. My favorite line: A false man or woman deserves death. It was amazing how most people in this time period thought it was acceptable to kill your cheating husband or wife since there was no law/punishment for adultery. Instead of going that route, Carlotta decided to devise a plan to seek revenge on her husband Dario, who had a secret affair with her best friend Beatrice. Dario and Beatrice were coldbloodedespecially the way they treated the daughter Chiara. You do not have to be a murderer or someone violent to be a villain. They were both despicable; they had no shame as though they were narcissistic psychopaths. But that takes a brilliant talent with the author's ability with characterization. As a reader, I really loathed some and really cared for others. It felt good to have a strong reaction toward everyone, instead of a blah, not caring reaction. Readers should hate Dario and Beatrice because, of course, Carlotta would not she would them in a positive light. After escaping from being buried alive they thought she had died from the plague, she wised up. Instead of crying in a corner, she got revenge. Mirella Sichirollo Patzer was also great with voice. The novel had a storytelling vibe as though Carlotta was talking directly to the readers. This tied in to the beginning where it is revealed she is transcribing her events I believe as a letter. I understood the concept of the story from the getgo, she would seek revenge, so I wished the word ""vendetta"" was not used so often in the narration. But then again, Carlotta",Best book ever!,"Yawatta Hosby's review on ""The Contessa's Vendetta"""

4705,"Here is another Historical Romance by Renee Rose what I totally enjoyed! I was thinking to myself, what is it about Renee's books that I seem to enjoy so much, because as I have said in the past, I do not normally read Historical. Is it the characters? And the answer would have to be yes. The chemistry between Amanda and Charles is evident from the first time they met. The story seamlessly sets it is selfup from the first chapter when we meet them after Amanda's carriage breaks down and The Colonel stops to help. We immediately connect with Amanda as she is telling her story to the hardships she and her sister and mother have endured after the death of her father and the family lost everything. Amanda does not wallow in selfpity but pulls up her big girl panties and does what needs to get done. She lies to get a job as a governess for two little one's whose father is absent due to the war. Now after having a few slips of Brandy, feeling bad about what she had to do, she confess this while waiting to be rescued. The next morning as Amanda walks into the dining room, she is not only surprised that her employer, the children's father is back, but he is also The Colonel who helped her last night and heard everything she said. Again, Amanda pulls up her big girl panties and faces the Colonel in his study to accept the fact that she may lose her job, but to her amazement, she leaves the study with her job in tack but a very sore bottom. It was refreshing to read a heroine who is strong and independent, but then does not whine. The Colonel is a man of great",A very good read by Renea Rose!,Another Great Novel from Renee Rose

4724,"This phone arrived in a box that made me immediately question whether or not it was a 'new' phone. The box and instructions are rather generic to Motorola. This is a touch screen, though the directions say to ""flip the phone open to make a call"" so obviously something are not quite new in the box.

That said, someone did take the time to put the tiny little MEID number on the side of the box because it is totally unreadable on the bottom of the phone. That was a bonus.

I was able to activate this phone by calling Verizon from my kitchen table and it worked within about 5 minutes. I like the size of it, and that it is only 3G.

Just a little piece of advice: if you are looking for the last good 3G phone out there, get this one. The technology is fine enough and you can still use all the data you want. If you switch to 4G, you will NOT get unlimited data anymore. That is the little 'catch' to 4G.

So replace the oldest phone on your contract that is no longer under contract with this nocontract phone and you will have a good option for the next year or so  or for however long this particular phone works.

I will update this review if things get wonky.  For now it is a Thumbs Up for a good deal with a little 'wink' about the phone being new. I could have swore when I ordered this, the description said NEW. It does not exactly say NEW on it now.","A good phone, but not a new one.","So far , so good."
4725,"I am actually using it now. I had the lap desk that had the pillow like bottom with the hard top. I was not a big fan because it never seemed flat and sturdy, plus the limited space only let me have the laptop on it. This lap desk, however, does offer enough space for me to have food, mouse, laptop on the desk all at once. So I love it for that. The angle that you can have when lifting the left side works great for reading and writing because you are not holding your head down which they say is a bad thing  does something to the neck and back but instead looking straight on more or less. You can put your laptop on the inclined part, but you will need the laptop/tablet that has a movable screen; otherwise, you end up with a wonky angle that is not conducive to working effectively. Besides those two things, the only downside, the drawer is really short length and heightwise, so I cannot put anything in it except a few pens, but no highlighters; the drawer will not close if I do. Also, and I believe other reviewers have said this, the clasps that lock the desk into place have a tendency of easing out of the hole that keeps the desk standing upright. The result is at times the desk seems to slant to the left or right while I am using it as the clasps slowly slide out. This is in large part because the round holes are not small or made to fit thin rectangular peg that is inserted to hold the desk top up. If the hole had been specifically designed as a flat rectangular hole that mirrored the clasp, this may have worked better.",Great,Love it but for the unreliable clasp

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.

4737,"If you have never experienced the innocence and eclecticism that was Caravan, you might as well start with this, their finest album.  They did a lot of other nice work, before and after IF I COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, FOR GIRLS WHO GROW PLUMP IN THE NIGHT, parts of WATERLOO LILY..., but this cd shows them at their best.
David Sinclair played keyboards  organ, piano and mellotron  and did some harmony vocals.  His Hammond organ dominated the band's sound, but never in a heavyhanded way, and his mellotron work was groundbreaking.  He used the instrument to play leads, not just to invoke swelling string section fills, as most practitioners did.  His cousin Richard Sinclair played bass and acoustic guitar and sang most of the leads  he has a pleasant but distinctive, unquestionably British voice, perfectly suited to their material he later lent his talents to the shatteringly talented ensemble Hatfield and the North.  Pye Hastings played guitar mostly rhythm and some nice understated lead work  he was, thankfully, never a posing 'guitar god' and did some of the lead vocals, and Richard Coughlin provided the rhythmic foundation with his tasteful drumming.  From time to time, Pye's brother Jimmy Hastings appears on flute and sax, adding to the slightly jazzy feel of their arrangements.
There is humor and whimsy in Caravan's music and lyrics  but never to the point of making them seem silly.  This is intelligently crafted music, but music that will bring a smile to your face  progressive, thoughtprovoking and hummable at the same time.  This band, and this album in particular, is one of the highlights of the 70s British music scene  and it has aged well.  The album is as enjoyable today as when it was released, in 1971.",A very good band,TAKE A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE...

It has worked wonderfully in our homemade lotion and body butter, but it is much too medicinal on any food.

For consumption, will not be buying this again, no matter the price. Actually may avoid it even for moisturizers, as the fragrance is just much too ""woody"" and unpleasant.

I would suggest you put all self generated files, e.g., documents on an external drive and then disconnect the drive just in case.

Shortly after the installation the OS did a critical update so when I came back to my computer it was done.  Note:  I did an 8.0 to  8.1 upgrade on my Surface pro the day before as a downloaded upgrade.  The results were not stellar to say the least.  On the tablet I had to remove the update because it wiped out the wifi connection and I tried everything I knew to restore it.  Once I backed off the update it worked just fine.  On the desktop New Dell that came native with 8 on it I began getting error messages saying that my IE browser was an old version of Netscape and it was incompatible.  The solution I found was to install the newest version of Fire Fox which seems to fixed the problem.  It appears that some vendors are not as compatible as they thought they were and MS has some work to do.

So In my estimation 8.1:
1.  Has some bugs that need to be addressed
2.  Is faster than 7 was
3.  Has a smaller learning curve
4.  Has some compatibility issues
5.  Needs to allow drive indexing for external drives to speed up the seek time
5. Needs MS attention to fix the glitches pronto if they want to gain in their market share.",The results weren't stellar to say the least,Improved OS over MS 8 but a few glitches to be aware of

These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me, and then some! These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight, but they also will not have you feeling overly weighed down, either. They are simply solidfeeling in weight and construction. I read many other reviews of these online, one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half, and who paid over $120.00 for his pair. Considering the price that I got these for comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon, I feel like I got mine at a steal, at less than $40.00! These Motorola headphones FEEL like they are worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I did not find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these IS NOT going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.

I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it is nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you will remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That is the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.

The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.

The movie is well worth the price it is an American classic. As long as dvd's and bluray and whatever comes after that exist, movie companies will always release the same dvds over and over again.",Pretty neat.,It's A Wonderful Life

I was hesitant about whether this ruler would slip like the narrower OmniGrid yardstick does. The OmniEdge does not! i did not find it necessary to add extra adhesive grippers to the ruler. It is wide enough to accommodate a large suction cup ruler handle. I use mine without a handle and have not had any slippage issues.

What happens when a shifter cannot shift? That question is answered in this fantastic novella which is part of the Black Hills Wolves. Stephen and Kate were introduced in a previous story, which you do not have to read to enjoy this one but it was also fantastic. But, Stephen and Kates romance is much different than anyone elses in their pack. The love is there but the communication is not. Until Kate is pushed she is not condemning Stephen to a life with a shifter that cannot shift. And, this is only part of the storyline! Surprisingly for such a short story, there is a multilevel storyline that will keep your interest in not only this couple but the entire pack. I cannot think of any way that this story could be made better because it has everything you could want; depth, great characters, awesome sex and plenty of action.

Kate has always loved Stephen but there is no way that she is telling him that. It does not matter that Stephen wants her to be his mate. She Is not putting him through having a mate that cannot shift. He deserves better than that. But, Stephen is not giving up. Hes a patient wolf and at some point he knows hell get Kate. When hunters come into town, Kate is going to have to make decisions that will change her life. Will Stephen still want to be around?

4853,"Raw and occasionally violent, yet tinged by touches of compassion, Vs. is not Pearl Jam's best, but an important stepping stone as the band began to find their unique sound, veering between hard, dark, cynical rock and deeply touching ballads.
 Vs. is a quantum leap forward after Ten, which, while a classic, was by no means earthshattering as a whole. Ament and Gossard became more experimental with their sound, veering away from the conventional throbbing support for the lyrics. A more raw, acoustic taste was utilised, allowing Vedder's amazing voice to come into its own as an integral and unique part of their sound. Highlights include the entire first 9 minutes Go, Animal and Daughter fuse together perfectly, as well as Rearviewmirror and Elderly Woman. It is fitting that PJ would reach their zenith with their next 2 albums, Vitalogy and Yield.",A quantum leap forward after Ten,PJ Begin To Find Their Voice

I decided to see if Mackie was truly an upgrade. This was my first purchase of Mackie gear of any kind! I am a mobile DJ that uses this type of mixer as a sub mixer to route my DJ controller, a hardwired mic and a wireless mic. Sometimes, I will route a back up mixing console through the mixer as well. The Construction is TOP SHELF. This thing is SOLID. All metal with exception to the knobs. The mic preamps are clean, powerful and very rich sounding. Depending on the gear that you are putting though it, I find myself using less EQ to balance out my sound. OUTPUTS I was first drawn to this mixer because it has XLR Balanced outputs I just like that better than 1/4"" TRS outputs. You can get roughly 2 more mixes out of this board as well making it a 3 Bus Board. I do not really use effects, and there are none builtin. There is a Power Switch on the rear my previous mixer did not have a power switch. I like a power switch! The LED display is VERY accurate. I have experienced better response from my powered speakers and a cleaner tighter mix because the ability to SEE what is happening! The MIC channels have a MUTE Button!!! I love that as well!

4866,"What a huge advance over their pretty spectacular Youth Oriented.

Every once in a while a band hits on just the right aesthetic.  Who knows why.  It just seems to happen.

That is what is going on here.  The perfectly credible rockish jazzy band Happy Apple, after a number of very good, if somewhat workmanlike discs, here breaks out with a session that blasts their past efforts not to mention just about all the other contenders into smithereens.

From the first number's throbbing, insistent, inyourface, bounding, cavorting, and thrumming sensibility, to the controlled aural chaos of ""Go [Base 13],"" the final cut, these lads establish a sonic authority and presence of huge proportions.

What they have have done here is fully grow into their initially brilliant but somewhat underrealized rockishjazz fusion vibe.  There is a huge freedom, a kind of devilmaycare insouciant recklessness only hinted at in their previous efforts:  They have locked into their particular musical vision so tightly here that they almost sound like a new band, although close listening connects their present moves with past efforts.

Dave King clearly establishes himself as the absolute maven of demented rock/jazz percussion just listen to his intro to ""See Sun Spot Run,"" the longest and most ambitious number on the disc.

4877,"are on bluray, in the 2disc set, all are excellent, for different reasons, and all are part of cinematic history. I like Spielberg's third Director's Cut the best, except that it excludes Roy at the power station in the beginning which was shown in the 1977 original theatrical release version. This scene was important, to show why Roy chooses not to show up for that job anymore after his initial UFO sighting the job was thankless and his bosses were real Aholes. Flipflopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India ""Where did these sounds come from?"" segments, which, I think, flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version. The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent deadquiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version, where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight. But, in the grand scheme, of the timeline of chronologically telling the story, one can see why Spielberg flipflopped the order of these two scenes. The ""pillow mountain bit"" is happily removed from the latter two versions; never much cared for that. Carl Weathers Apollo Creed of Rocky fame does a brief cameo in the 1977 version as an Army seargant who interrogates suspiciouslooking Roy, who looks like a potential looter, during the evacuation sequence, when the bird salesman is doing a great scare job in the background. This bit, quirky but not really necessary, is happily removed from the latter two versions, and instead the scene hangs on the bird salesman saying ""Even my dog has a gas mask!

4880,"""Gen X Cops"" is not quite your average Hong Kong action movie, adopting instead the look of a low budget Hollywood summer flick. A trio of young cops with an attitude tail gangsters all while looking pretty damn cool at it. Jack Nic Tse, Match Stephen Fung, and Alien alienlike Sam Lee find themselves kicked out of police academy only to be picked up by Officer Chan Eric Tsang, himself on the outs with his unsympathetic superiors. Chan wants their help on a dangerous undercover mission, one involving gang bosses, gang betrayals, and rocket fuel ?? They are joined by Y2K Grace Yip whose sole purpose it seems is to be the tough girl of the group. Everyone is got a little something to prove and set out to get a little respect. Balletic gunfights, questionable English, and the explosion of a Hong Kong landmark ensue. The formulaic plot satisfies for the most part and makes sense in that action movie sort of way. Nothing is too overthetop, equaling harmless fun for all. Clearly no one is taking themselves too seriously, and director Benny Chan was smart in throwing in a healthy dose of humor. The end result is a slick, satisfying 1 1/2 hour reality break. The cast consists mostly of young talents but the older actors turn in some scene stealing performances as well. Francis Ng, who owns every role he takes, stands out as gang boss Lok. He possesses an intensity that keeps his character believable without giving into parody. Beware Jackie Chan fans; he produced the movie and only appears for a one minute cameo at the end. The DVD extras will not disappoint either. In addition to the Coming Attractions, the Special Features include cast and credit info, a production diary, a film magic sequence",a good movie,a fun action flick

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.

I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. You Have got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or did not read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod?

The score is well sung but that seems to be the main problemit is too well sung. Everyone seems to be singing as if walking on eggshells as if a little spontaneity may fracture the integrity of the score. This overzealous respect for the score really shows in one of the most jubilant moments in the show. Nellie is kicking up her heels and walking on air singing about finding ""A Wonderful Guy"" But Kelli O'Hara has been directed to sing the song without much joy or zing and she seems to have just found ""An ok Guy"" I rated this 4 stars principally for the score and the cast including Miss O'Hara, Paolo Szot and Matthew Morrison who are all fine singers but at least on this recording while the songs are well sungbut that is itwell sung but no surprises. Maybe it is just mebut when I opened the accompanying booklet there is a picture of Kelli O'Hara dressed in an oversized sailor suit and hat. At first glance i would swear it was Reba McIntyre. I watched the Tony Awards and Kelli O'Hara performed ""A Wonderful Guy"". She was bright, perky, energeticshe even cartwheeled across the stagebut what is more important she sang the song full throttle with the joy she should be feeling at that moment.

But after a while I began to take notice of which picks felt right versus which ones did not and I began to single out my favorites. I had settled on Fender mediums as my pick of choice yet felt they could be better. After all, you take an aggressive song with a couple good pick slides in it and your Fender pick looks like Jethro's gaptoothed grin and the edge is completely worn away.
 Once I discovered the Dunlop Delrin picks, I have not used another brand or style. Simply because they were exactly what I was looking for. Just enough resistance to keep the string attack clean and enough flexibility to keep the pick firmly within your grasp. The materials from which the Delrins are made offers superior wear resistance. Greater wear resistance  longer life  using fewer picks. I used to go one or two songs and need a new pick. Now one pick lasts me an entire rehearsal. Buy these, see for yourself!",Five Stars,Dunlop delrin .71mm

In 2001, they released their first gospel album in 25 years, and last year, they brought out 11 brand new Christmas songs. Now, they celebrate everything they have stood for through their career: Faith, Family, and Country. Each song falls into this category in some form, and the result is, yet again, outstanding!

I saved you two hours. Oh but there is a kicker, the joke is not funny and everyone knows it. Yet, of course, some of the comedians tell it like it is the funniest thing in the world  Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Godfried, Bob Sagat, and South Park are definite highlights. And I love Sarah Silverman. However, the awful cinematography, horrific editing, and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people did not burn down the theaters when they realized this film was not getting any better.

There was no reason to make the changes to Office that they have made; it was simply a way to justify an unnecessary upgrade that has turned out to be a downgrade. Users with a moderate understanding of how Office operated will find themselves flummoxed when attempting to do things they had finally learned how to do in the old version.

The muchvaunted ribbons are confusing and counterintuitive. Microsoft addresses this problem by offering free selfpaced trainng courses, apparently oblivious to the fact that time iS money, unless of course, it is Microsoft's time.

First of all, if you have read Hopeless by Colleen Hoover and disliked it because of how unrealistic it is, then do not read this book because the problems that I had with that novel are the same that I have with this one.

Hanley is such an idiot and being drunk is not an excuse for her idiocy because she tells him to leave when she is drunk. But even excusing this, these are the things that made me stop reading this. Like we do not live in a world where you can just randomly drink water that a stranger gives you because you know that they will not drug you. The fact that the author failed to realize that and decided to make this story like that is ridiculous.

1. The second she realizes that there is a stranger in her garage, instead of running and screaming for help, she stands there and makes small talk with him because he says, ""I am innocent"".

2. While looking at his mouth when he smiles at her ugh she imagines kissing him. Mind you, they just met like a minute ago.

3. He commands her to drink some water that he just so happens to have and you know what? She does. She does not know this guy, she dropped her keys on the ground and her ankle is killing her so she obeys this stanger guy and drinks some 'water'!",I am shocked,Where You'll Find Me

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

One thing I do not like is that the cream is scented and it lingers after use. It is sort of a flowery scent with a hint of menthol. It is not an obtrusive smell but it lingers for hours after application. For that reason, I would use it at night before going to bed and the smell mostly goes away by the next morning.

5071,"All 6 channel micro helicopters require a conversion to brushless, in my opinion. If you convert the main motor to brushless and the tail motor to a 7 mm diameter motor, you will have a low maintenance helicopter. To do a brushless conversion on the main motor, you need a WKWST10ALT, a C05M motor, a Genius CP main gear, and an 8 tooth pinion if you do not plan to do stunt flying, a 7 tooth pinion is better. Total cost with shipping is $45.80. Do not buy the official Walkera brushless kit. To convert to a 7 mm diameter motor on the tail, you need the motor, a tail fin, tail motor holder. Crash survivability is good, better than any brand, but even then, you should avoid crashing any helicopter. You should reinforce the canopy with duct tape inside out, forward of the front legs. A Walkera Genius CP requires reinforcement of the front legs of the landing skid, but in my opinion, you do not need to reinforce the Super CP's landing gear. You should strap down the battery connector to the battery cage with string to relieve the stress imposed on the solder points at the circuit board. After doing modifications and refinements, there is still a problem that can be fixed only by Walkera: The heli hovers fine but when flying forward with zero rudder, the tail swings to the right, causing your path to curve left. This is less of a problem with the Super CP than with a Genius CP, which I also own. The Devo 7E has limited range. If you plan to buy a larger heli, you will want a Devo 6, 7, or higher. The advantage that the Devo 7E has over the Devo 7 is you can install the deviationtx",All 6 channel micro helicopters require a conversion to brushless,Low Maintenance RC

I cannot get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up. Then I pulled it all out and there was not any lint at all that came out.

5088,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",Good kit for dryer vents,good kit with some caveats

Trend Micro AntiVirus  AntiSpyware allows you to send and receive email and share files with protection from malicious viruses, Trojan horse programs, and spyware.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Stormy owns a second hand book store, and is a Bookaholic. She gets so lost in reading, she loses all track of time and never knows anything that is going on around her. When the neighborhood goons set their sights on Stormy for her bookstore property they want to own every property in town, Bender is called back to the place he grew up. He winds up protecting Stormy. The two goons, Mick and Nutter appropriately named, are insane and do some very bad things. However, I felt the parts with them were just written as in, I felt no real emotions. They were bad, but the author did not make me despise them as I should have. The most frustrating part to me, was the only true sex description was not with the main couple, but one of the goons being bad. This was disappointing to me on the few times the main couple had it, it seemed rushed and glossed over. I feel the story would have been so much better if the main characters sex scenes showed the growing passion and love, to be more satisfying. I also felt, as some points, that it was almost glaringly unbelievable. If Bender had been away for nearly 20 years this was what I surmised, how was he still so 'well known' and just hearing the name brought fear to people? Even new people in town.

5163,"I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon, as I had an identical one last year purchased locally, but it cracked and shattered during a hard freeze in the winter.  It was all my fault, because I did not bring it inside to prevent that.  I was very upset, and my husband promised to buy me a new one.  Unfortunately, he could not find one.  Imagine my delight when I found it on Amazon!!  This gorgeous glass birdbath bowl is absolutely stunning.  The colors are vibrant, and when the sun hits it, oh, boy, it is spectacular!  The glass is very thick and heavy, so I guess I did not think it would crack in a freeze, but I will definitely bring this one inside in the winter.  I am thrilled with this purchase, and the seller packed it amazingly well.  Fast shipping, too.  I have purchased 3 items from this seller recently check out their gorgeous garden flags! and I intend to become a regular customer!!  Perfect transactions!! Thank you so much!!

5166,"I use this keyboard with my smartphone Moto G4 whenever I want to type something more than a few words long. I have been using it for a couple weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. The feel of the keys and build quality are surprisingly good, given the pricepoint. And I personally like that it uses conventional AAA batteries rather than builtin rechargeable batteries. I have seen too many news stories about products with rechargeable batteries having fire risks. The only negative I have encountered so far is that the keyboard does go to sleep. So, when I have not used it for a while, I often type a random key a few times until it wakes up then erase the one or two unnecessary characters and proceed as usual. This is not that much of a hassle, and I understand it is doing it to save my batteries; but, in the spirit of full disclosure, I thought I would mention it.

Great product. I hope you have the same experience I have.",Great keyboard...,Surprisingly nice feel and build quality for the money

5169,"I am a fan of DEWALT tools. They generally work well and last a long time. I thought this DEWALT scanner would be a really neat thing to add to the tools I already have.

As with all DEWALT tools, this scanner is wellbuilt, has a durable case, stores easily and has a great rechargeable battery. As far as execution goes though, this tool just does not do the job. At first, I thought, Wow, this scanner is finding some really great stuff in the walls. But then it fails to find studs, studs that I know are there, studs that I screw into. I do not feel this tool is reliable enough for me to trust. I do not know if its finding phantom things in the walls, but I do know that it misses obvious stuff like two by fours. If it had more consistent and accurate readings, it would certainly be a great tool.",I think this DEWALT scanner would be a really neat thing to add,"Great idea, inconsistent results"
5170,"As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save likeminded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title. While this is not platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive. I would like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon does not allow for prerelease nonreviews. So I am assigning 5 stars based on NCAA 2004, and the promise of the following new features. That aside despite it being a huge issue, the following changes come directly from EA Sports announcements. What follows is verifiable on their website or with a few wellplaced Google searches. I present it for convenience. These 'prerelease reviews' that always pop up for titles might as well serve a real purpose, besides of course the allimportant ""tHIs gAme iS dEFiNaTEly sic gOInG tO RAwK!!!"" proclamations. But I digress, the summary follows, I intend to keep my personal commentary to an absolute minimum; GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS: Big hits: The option to take a chance on really plastering another player. Increases the chance of a fumble or dropped pass, but also the chance of you whiffing on the tackle. Improved run blocking and new run animations: No more getting stuck against or behind your own linemen. Good offensive lines now open better holes and routes. Home Field Advantage: The bigger the stadium, the louder the crowd, the greater the impact. Pumping up the crowd carries more meaning and response. Visiting teams have to fight an uphill battle against the environment, based upon the strength of the home team's stadium and crowd. Interactive Timeouts: You are now given a choice on which group to coach, it can",...a lot of old content.,"New features summary, not a review."

5172,"Just received item in mail today, upon unboxing I found a complete instruction booklet, two bags of prongs for the devices, two collars, two receiver units, and one hand held unit with a usb to wall 110v style charger. First thing I noticed with these units is where the power button is located under the collar , I find this a hard to reach area once the collar is installed due to charging and turning off, sooner or later the collar or plastic will wear and one will give, probably the plastic, but will see how it goes. So far the units look well constructed, I used it at night after a charge and the ""Light"" setting option is not a viable option at all as for the light is not on the front of the unit and it is hard to see the red blinking light, even though the instructions says it will be green. So far the sound is pretty decent, but does sound like a broken buzzer or blown horn , lol but gets the dogs attention, the vibration mode is pretty noticeable at one setting 100 is very noticeable, one 1 the shock is faint unless held tight in your hand, I would not recommend doing it at 100, pretty strong , knocked me almost down and I am a fairly sized guy 50 seemed to be enough for a large dog, will update this review as time progresses using this unit, so far it seems pretty decent for price , features, just annoying to remove one collar sleeve to charge or turn the unit off and the useless light option. time will tell on reliability of batteries and the unit since all have built in rechargeable.. Not sure about weather or water resistance yet or",Not good for price,"Just reciever on June 5th, will update revieve with further use."

5179,"I am an old lady avidly playing one Nancy Drew game after another! The reason I did not give ""Secret"" 5 stars is because a few of the puzzles, such as having to collect vegetables and eggs twice are just plain boring. However, you get a real feel for the old west as the graphics are excellent. The Indian relics and ruins and the ghost town are very well done and the indoor scenes are great, such as Shadow Ranch Lodge, Mary's Gift shop and Cappy's, the remnant of an old saloon. The horse lore that you will learn such as the proper term for each horse color is downright interesting. And as a ranch hand you will be obliged to put a dismembered bridle together, feed the three horses and the chickens their various rations, bake a cake, run a barrel race and ride your faithful horse Bob to interesting places, sleuthing all the way. The puzzles cover a pretty wide gamut of difficulty from the very easy the vegetables and eggs and the chicken wire fence repair to the reasonably hardthe Indian ruins maze. The number and variety of puzzles should please just about everybody except, perhaps, accomplished and sophisticated gamers. The latter would find ""The Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" a much bigger challenge for their abilities. The voice acting is first rate and the lip synch and gestures are fine. Tex, the onery cowboy with an incredibly deep voice, is very funny. Dave, another ranch hand, is very cute, as Nancy noticed and points out. All and all ""Secrets of Shadow Ranch"" is a very pleasant experience, and even though it took me about ten tries to trick the culprit at the end I get in such a flap when a puzzle is timed I finally succeeded.",Great puzzles,Very Atmospheric!

5200,"I bought this for my dog who was having some old lady incontinence. I had her on Proin which worked great but am a little hesitant to keep her on it some of the side effects are raised blood pressure, etc so I thought if I could find a natural alternative to that it would be great. So this works better than having her on nothing, but still does not work as great as the Proin unfortunately. I have had her on this for about 2 months or so 1 pill twice a day because she is just over 50lbs. While it does decrease the frequency and amount she dribbles pee in her sleep it does not completely stop it like the Proin did so sadly I am probably going to have to go back to that after I finish this bottle. The other downside is these pills have an extremely strong odor and my dog would not take them by themselves or set on top of her kibble. The Proin she would just eat out of my hand or on top of her kibble but this pill I either have to put in a pill pocket or mix into canned food for her to take it.",Works Well,I had her on Proin which worked great but am a little hesitant to keep her on ...

5206,"Thirty some years after it is release many of the songs from ""Led Zeppelin II"" can still be heard on album oriented rock AORradio. Zeppelin displays their swagger on ""Whole Lotta Love"", ""Heartbreaker"", ""Ramble On"", ""Bring It On Home"". ""What Is And What Should Never Be"" starts off laid back, but do not be lulled to sleep because the boys ""kick it up a notch"" and Page makes things interesting by switching his guitar between the right and left channel. Page also follows this similar production style on ""The Lemon Song"". Chester Burnett a.k.a Howlin' Wolf is credited for writting ""The Lemon Song"", it seems like a reprise of his song ""Killing Floor"". An interesting note about this song, the line ""squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg"" is a direct quotation from Robert Johnson's ""Travelling Riverside Blues but there is no credit given to him. It would be interesting to know if there were ever any legal issues regarding ""borrowed line"". See ""Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings"" It is a great song nevertheless, it features Page's guitar pyrotechnics and Jone's steady bass groove. Speaking of interesting production, notice on ""Whole Lotta Love"" near the end of the song when Plant sings, ""...Way down inside, Woman, you need love..."" that Plant's voice echo's first before the lyrics are said. It is my understanding that Page took the forward take of that lyric, recorded it backward, then played it again backward while recording it to the master tape so the echo would be first. ""Thank You"" is a great acoustic ballad which features the lighter side of the band. Jones seems to float along in the background on the organ accompanying Page through out.

5231,"Elizabeth Lennox has released the first of her new series for the Bold Alaskan Men. The Billionaires Beautiful Mistake. I enjoyed reading this book and am looking forward to more. One of the reasons I liked it is that although I really enjoy reading Ms. Lennoxs sheik romances, it is nice to see the stories take on a new location and the wilds of Alaska I believe is an amazing choice for relocation. She still has her focus of several characters that create her bonded group and each will have his own story in the series. The men are childhood friends that came from very humble beginnings and clawed their way to success. Each of the characters are definitely strong, intelligent alphas that lead the industry of their choosing and leave their competitors quaking. But when they are no longer in the board room or office, they have each other to lean on, to trust and to protect as brothers. In the first book, The Billionaires Beautiful Mistake, Ms. Lennox brings us Creek and Violet who are a wonderful match! Creek is very much wrapped up in his business and never looks at women as a possible permanent situation, but one of need and convenience. Until he meets Violet and finds that no matter what he cannot stay away. Everything about Violet holds his attention. Violet is no different than Creek with this attraction that sizzles between them. She thinks he is the most delicious thing she has seen, but unfortunately Violet has selfesteem issues and does not believe Creek would be interested in her. Violet and Creek begin their relationship but they unknowingly fall victim to anothers manipulations and greed.

5249,"I have two of these  one for each car. This is an excellent bluetooth speakerphone. This does not have any of the fancy features, like caller ID number or name, FM Transmitter ,etc. But it does its intended job extremely well...

 Extremely long battery life. I use it for around 1 hour on each working day during office commute. In last 810 months, I have not charged it for more than 4 times.

 Very good sound quality. Nobody has ever complained to me that the voice quality is bad.

 Volume is very good. I have a Ford Fusion and Honda accord. None of the cars is a very silent one and I have had no issues even on highways.

 Buttons are pretty straightforward to use. Dedicated Mute button, simple to use volume and call accept/reject buttons.

 Never have had any issues with phone pairing, reconnect. I use these with iPhone 3GS and a blackberry curve

 Auto shutoff after the phone moves out of range. People have complained that the bluetooth remains connected even after getting out of the car inside the house. Yes, that will obviously happen. It shuts off automatically if you move out of range or switch off the phone's bluetooth.

Summary: You can buy other bluetooth speakerphones with more fancy features for $1020$ more, but if you want a BT Speakerphone with excellent basic features that actually work, this is one of the best items you can get. $30 is what I paid for it.",Excellent bluetooth speakerphone,BT Speakerphone with excellent basic features that actually work

The combat system is very engaging and fast paced and is a lot of fun. If you want a game that gives you an opportunity to simply beat down dozens of opponents at one time while being engaged in a very interesting world with a good storyline then this is probably a game you would enjoy. You can tell that when writing this game the developers put a lot of thought into it and did their research.

The only real drawback in this game I would have to say is that your companions are not as interesting as they tend to be in the other Bioware games.

5272,"The one superb attribute of FFXII that trumps its few negatives is the new battle and character leveling processes. True, the story and music are arguably not as refined as previous FFs and other epic RPGs like ""Knights of the Old Republic"". Also, I agree that this title does not have that ""Fantasy"" feel anymore and feels more ""realistic"". However, the combat levelingup processes are superior to other RPGs, at least the ones I played. This quality makes the game real fun to play. For some folks, the biggest drawback in turnedbased RPGs are the endless timeconsuming randomized battles that must be completed to level up your characters enough to fight bosses and complete major storyline missions effectively. Though you still have to battle a great deal of ""randomized"" baddies to level up your characters, in most cases, the end user is in total control of what they choose to fight and when as well as disposing of said enemies quickly. The new combat system that Final Fantasy XII employs is not really a new gaming idea. I have never played an MMORPG, but Knights of the Old Republic for XBOX uses the same semirealtime combat system. FFXII takes that to the next level by allowing the end user to design a highly detailed and situational ""script"" / ""algorithm"" for characters to follow in battle the Gambit system. With all of this said, the end user still has the ability to bypass ""the script"" at any point in combat to control the actions of each character. In addition, the leveling up process, though admittedly a little hard to comprehend at first, is simply awesome once you get used to it. The end user has the ability to make each of their characters as flexible as they wish and not follow",Good game,It's Great for What it Does

I bought the equipment, the R410a, and about $1000 worth of specialty tools no shortcuts  almost all online 95 Amazon.  I did this  after loads of research  because I wanted to ensure that my specific installation wishes would be fulfilled.  And I still saved $1500 over the lowest bid and that guy completely ignored a specific request.

This vacuum pump easily evacuated my 2 ton system with 33' lines 3/4 and 3/8 down to 300 microns in less than half an hour.  For the price, I am thrilled.  I also feel it is pretty good quality, and I am happy to have it around.  If you need to get a lower vacuum than that, I believe you need a 2 stage model.

The one thing I do not like is that this model like their other onestage models is that it does not have a shutoff valve, meaning as soon as you turn the pump off, your system returns to atmosphere unless you add one inline or find another way to isolate your system while you wait to be sure the vacuum does not disappear with the pump shut off.

As someone else mentioned, I do not believe they supply the best oil available, and in this case it was just enough to fill it to max one time, and then it seemed to dispel some of the oil while I was running it a lot trying to get my vacuum gauge to work properly.  So...buy some extra oil in case you need it.",Works great with my gas furnace,Inexpensive Option for Home Unit Install
5305,"This movie sits next to ""Blade Runner"" on the top of my list as the best films of ALL time.  I have been watching the standard cardboard case DVD for 10 years now, and it looked really BAD on my HD LCD.

When I fired this baby up and ""Mad Max 2,"" the original Austrailian title came up instead of the YOU.S. ""Road Warrior,"" I almost fell out of my chair!  The clarity and crystal clearness of the picture was everthing I have been dreaming for.  I could not believe that a film this old could ever look like this.  The sound in my 5.1 theater is even better.  My wife who hates action flicks even sat through with me and was impressed.

Sure there is not much extras on the disk, but who has time for those?  The film is what matters most.

The story is about the ultimate antihero, a broken man who wanders into a postapocalytic wasteland battling scavengers for gasoline.  This film has the most amazing stuntwork and car chases.  It has been cloned, copied and is pretty much an important model for all science fiction post apocalytic action films.

5312,"""Moment of Truth"" is probably one of the best rap albums start to finish i have ever heard. Even some seminal classics have one or two tracks that do not work. Here, Gang Starr has crafted an album so tight, that every song is incredible and possibly flawless. There are 3 aspects that make this album so great: 1. The production on here is amazing; DJ Premier used some of his most creative beats on this album. Front to back the production here challenges works on par with Dre and Pete Rock. ""Steez"" shows genius in simplicity, ""Milita"" is a hardcore classic, ""Above the Clouds"" uses some insane samples, ""Rep Grows Bigga"" scratches like no other, ""What I am Here 4"" uses sick pianos ""Royaltiy"" might be the greatest underground single ever. Those are just off the top of my head, every beat is truly note worthy. But for me ""Next Time"" pushes this classic to the next level. I cannot speak of how infectious the horns are on this one. A friend of mine who HATES rap absolutely loves this song because of the production. Fact is the album could be a masterpiece alone from the music vibes. 2. The guests on this album drop some insane quotables. Scarface, G Dep, Hannible, M.O.P. literally bring some of their best work. Even KC Jojo drop a hook that is completely underground. Krumb Snatcha's verse was a Source HipHop quotable ""it is like, microphone roulette/ because nowadays MC's is gettin wet/ over someone else's fake gangsta rep"", Inspectah Deck has one of the best Wu spots ever ""I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large/ Wild like rock stars who smash guitars/ Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage/ and catch a charge shake them down like the",One of the best rap albums ever,This is it.. simply one of the greatest albums front to back

I think I am a believer and from now on, this will be my go to, especially that the liquid bleach is really ruining my new washing machine where I have to pour it in the little drawer made for bleach.

5343,"This book was wonderful and confusing all at once.  First the gooTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry
I like how Laura and Vorad came together in the end and resolved their differences.  It was a sweet story that love could overcome all obstacles.  I particularly like the fact that Vorad saw that Laura had been duped by her own people and that she could be trusted in time before he or Gray did something irreversible.
Now to the not so gooTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry
Again, Ms. Kane jumped around within a singular viewpoint so that it was hard to tell what was going on and when.  Also, the fact that she mentions Laura was held captive for a week and then later indicated it was only a matter of a couple days made me feel I was missing something.  And on top of that, I sometimes get lost during the characters' conversations because of no indicators as to who is speaking, though there was not as much of that going on here as there was in the last two books of this miniseries.  Also, there is no way a bomb on a rocket fired from Earth orbit could reach any other planet in a matter of days as is implied in the storyline.  That also took away from my enjoyment of the book.
In closing, I recommend this book as a quick and fun read, but there are some technical issues to ignore if you get annoyed by the reasons mentioned above.",Amazingly interesting,"It's good, but..."

5346,"Contacted Griffin after poor screen durability and camera cover falling off.  After sending pics, Griffin support said the one I was sold is counterfeit.

""I am sorry to say that the case you purchased is a counterfeit. I am attaching a photo of the genuine packaging so you can see for yourself. There are a lot of color and font related issues but the biggest giveaway is the entire box. The genuine packaging has a two tone box, matte black and grey while your packaging is entirely black. Some of the other giveaways are the images, like the image of the iPad in the middle, you can see that the screen on our iPad image is a different color, you can also see that the colored bars to the right of the iPad image are different colors.

Your best option is to contact the seller and demand a refund as you were sold a counterfeit good.

5349,"The author, Louise Barnes, has covered the numerous benefits of grain free eating in the book. The book is of Particular Interest to Paleo Eaters and Gluten Free Alike. This Recipe Book is actually TWO COOK BOOKS in one. A lot of cook books claim that, but this one really is. The SMOOTHIE Recipes are an Entire Cook Book, themselves. They are a wide range of Innovative and Delicious Smoothie Recipes. I have Listed just a Few Below. The rest of the book, could have been a separate cook book, entirely. The recipes are simple to make and ingredients are readily available. I especially liked the recipe for Pecan Granola Crunch It uses Applesauce and Maple Syrup as a sweetener, instead of processed sugar or honey, as most granolas do and contains only healthy ingredients. KUDOS on that!! Since the entire recipe only contains cup maple syrup, that is not much, because that is being added to 4 cups of Pecans, Dates, Sunflower Seeds and Unsweetened Coconut. I made it last Night and Left Out the Dates. Instead, I Added In Sliced Almonds and my unsweetened Dried Cranberries, I dried over Christmas. YUMMY!! OK, so I did not follow the recipe, but it was still good and I Am sure if you follow the authors recipe, it would be Great!! I do not eat my Granola as much as a cereal, as I do for a topping for Greek Yogurt and as a Snack. The author uses Coconut Flour frequently and I like that. A lot of people are unfamiliar with it, but if you are cooking Gluten Free or Low Carb, you need to start incorporating it.

5350,"4.5 stars I love everything about this album, EXCEPT for the lofi production values. I wonder if Steve Austin keeps things lofi to keep some of their original indie cred to them, keeping them from being orthodox members of the extreme metal crowd. Really, he would not have to worry. I remember seeing Austin as a wee lad opening for I do not remember who at the Uptown Bar in Minneapolis. It was not near as Metal, but it was all the excruciating anguish and dissonance that you hear on _Sadness Will Prevail_. Fast forward fifteen years and I am a fullblown Mastodon fanatic and I find out that drummer extraordinaire Brann Dailor honed his chops with Austin. And then I work my way to this albumHOLY OF UNHOLIES!!! These guys are all over the place. Crimsonesque violins, a song that features endless bell tree and a harp being BEATEN underneath Austin's visceral imprecations ""Butterflies""nothing like it, acoustic laments on acid, oh yeah and some of the extremest metal/hardcore you will ever hear. These guys are everywhere. I am shocked that Austin has managed to manifest such a formidable output when he nurses such a damaged psyche. And I am only on disc X of this tour de force. Nothing can prepare you for what occurs on the second disc, disc Y. The experimental tag gets put on way too many things in the rock world Radiohead rarely experimentsthey compose; ditto Sepultura, Deerhoof, and so forth. Disc Y, on the other hand, is like listening to a chemist let loose in a laboratory with every substance known to humankind. And the results are just as scary with Austin seeing what he comes up with. The interminable ""Never Answer the Phone"" is especially freaky, disconcerting, and fascinating.

5362,James Patterson did not write this.  Michael Ledwidge did. If you read some of Michael's other works you will see. Any of the books with Patterson's name and someone else is NOT a Patterson book. he comes up with the IDEA and then the publisher picks the writer. It is an awful extreme way of publishing for profit and takes away from the craft of writing. The story's have been awful you would think that Patterson fans would know this and put a stop to this crap by NOT buying his book with another authors name on it. What gets me is that the copyright is in Patterson's name. Why? He did not write this. I hope Michael got a BIG payment out of this...I also hope he got a large chunk of the money CBS or is it NBC not sure which one of them payed for the rights to turn this into a Summer mini series  UNDER THE DOME COMES TO MIND UGH. More than likely it all went to Patterson. Really do not like when an author decides to send in an idea to get them written by someone else and then takes all the credit.

5376,"I have been harboring some resentment against these two ever since they got real popular about five years back, and started to decline slightly into fame. When I heard that Jack and Meg were ditching their old fashioned style of reel to reel recording, and finally going digital I pretty much disowned them. Hearing the single initially did not help much either, with the Limp Bizkit meets weird al rap hooks... I thought it was all done. Then a friend of mine gave me the CD, just to say..LISTEN.. and then... I am pleased to say once again that The White Stripes rock. They are a pretty damned cool little duo. Forget that The White Stripes now record in digital.. because its more like digital went White Stripe than it is the other way around. Amazing collection of sounds are put together on this album, spanning the sounds of popular music from the last hundred years so i read and really, where the last two albums have lacked somewhat, this album really shines... its full, and its packed with variety, that still flows remarkably well. Makes much of the`last two efforts seem flat in comparison. Maybe us oldschoolers are wrong about the digital age. Apparently it just takes someone to know what to do with it. Highlights for me are mainly in the second half with the pounding LITTLE CREAM SODA.. the plainly awesome RAG AND BONE defies me...""if you do not want it, we will take it!"" and SLOWLY TURNING INTO YOU, but the first half is cool too with amazingly different, but familiar songs like CONQUEST sort of an old time mamba thing going on? 300MPH, a ""thumper"", the poppy YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT LOVE IS, and even the title track quickly grows on you I have",Amazing collection of sounds are put together on this album.,I TAKE IT BACK- WHITE STRIPES CAN STILL ROCK!

Cat then went to go back to her home never expecting to see Nick again. Nick tired of the crazy of everything that goes with his band and a breakdown decided to get out of dodge and get fresh air, he then remembered what Cat had told him about her home and thought that would be the best place to regroup. When Nick walks through Cat's door and everytime Nick is around he always brings out the worst in her. What I enjoyed most about The Worst of Me is watching a man who is a known Womanizer and does not even remember bedding half of them from always being drunk, but when it comes to Cat she is different from all the other woman and he feels for her in a way he has never felt for another. Cat a Woman who does not see the good in him until way later and starts to have feelings for him. All Nick ever wanted was for a Woman to want and love him for him and not what he could do for them and his fame. This book is amazing. I was captured within every page I read, you could feel the feelings of both Nick and Cat throughout their fighting, becoming lovers etc. This book is about a very popular band with Nick being the Lead, the fame that he used to loved so much just is not the same anymore and its causing panic attacks, a Woman who has heard of him but not impressed and the first woman",The Worst of Me,A love story with your exact opposite!

Upon opening and setting up the new console, I was excited to get the initial set up complete and throw in Titanfall and start playing. My excitement quickly faded when the initial setup/download took over an hour and a half. After the download for the setup was finished, I decided to check my internet connection and it was working at a fast speed with no foreseeable problems which drew more questions. I then went to type in the code to download the Titanfall game that was included in my bundle. After close to 3 hours, the download was only at 7 and I became worried. Still not wanting to give up on the Xbox one before I had even played it yet, I decided to throw in a game my wife had gotten and the console made me do an immediate update for her game which only took half an hour. Once the update was completed, it made me download the game to the hard drive which took an hour and a half. After her game finally finished downloading, she played it for about 20 minutes before we headed to bed for the night. Thinking that leaving the console for the next few hours to let Titanfall download seemed like a good idea. When I woke up in the morning and not only had the game not downloaded but the Xbox had turned off right after I went to sleep. When I turned the console on in the morning, the download had stopped and had gone back down to 1.

5394,"TurboTax has been my tax software choice for 15 years running. During that time, Intuit has offered better and weake versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I have used to date. If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I would not hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a threeday long parade of headacheinducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy. Those days are happily in the past This version allows you to prepare and EFile up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine 64bit, Intel i73770 CPU 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM. Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.

I cannot get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up. Then I pulled it all out and there was not any lint at all that came out. So now I am resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Emily is a little bristly at the first of this story, and hard to warm up to, but she thaws out as the story progresses, and we find out more about her background. James is completely adorable. He is a sweetheart of a flirt. All women he encounters blush and giggle around him, no women are immune it seems, until he encounters his Innkeeper Emily. She is not going to give in like the rest of the gigglers she is working with, and she puts on a hard she will, but secretly he is knocking down her defenses and getting under her skin.

It is cute watching this couple knock heads, and then finally give into their desires for each other. There is old boyfriends monkeywrenching into the couple's relationship, as well as a thieving mystery in the background of the story. Best of all, this story ends with a very Happily Ever After!",Fun little story.,Another winner in Stars Landing.

He is that rare cleancut vocalist that will last a very long time and continue to entertain us all with great songs, inspirational, country, and I believe very easily big pop ballads, if he wants to or tries to.

Much was made of his voice changing...and its great to see its for the better.  I hope Billy's management continue to push him harder and further and farther...right into pop stardom...but should he remain doing what he already has  entertained us all from the heart  I will still continue to listen....and I think you as Amazonian buyers should too!

5420,"This is the dream game of all Star Wars fans one where you actually get to wield a ""lightsaber"" in the real world and see your enemies get shredded on the screen. The Wii's interactive controllers achieve this by translating your reallife slashes, punches, and twists into devastating lightsaber strikes, powerful forcepushes, and Vaderlike chokes all on your television screen. What Star Wars fan WOULD NOT want to own this game on the Wii? But what if you are not a Star Wars fan? Judging The Force Unleashed on game mechanics rather than movie nostalgia, it still holds up pretty well. Here are a few of the high and low points: Controls. The Wii controls are significantly responsive, allowing players to feel like they are really ""in the game."" The biggest drawback of the controls, however, is that the ability to parry melee attacks is almost completely lacking. The large selection of offensive abilities, however, helps to make up for this. View. The game is primarily thirdperson similar to Tomb Raider and Mercenaries 2. The ""camera"" chases the character rather than being fixed, which can cause various problems in tight situations, especially when fighting bosses. Levels. The levels tend to be very visually interesting, but can get repetitive at times just like most other action games. You will slash, blast, and pound your way through thousands of enemy soldiers, then encounter ""bosses"" that usually have an exploitable weakness. Diversity. There are numerous powers, uniforms, and upgrades to acquire, allowing players to complete the majority of a level with their own style of play the exception to this is the kill sequence used to finish a boss, and that must be followed precisely. Levels are very direct, however, so all players will be traveling the same basic path with few alterations.",The real-world slash game is pretty good,Wield a Lightsaber and Live the Fantasy!

5426,"The Adore June Keeb case is perfect protection for the Apple Wireless Keyboard.  It is easy to carry around so, I always have access to my wireless keyboard.  Now I can set up my home office practically anywhere!

SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES

PROS:
The case exterior is an easy to clean cotton canvas  a well made utilitarian case.

The case interior is lined with soft polar fleece that protects the Apple keyboard from bumps and scratches.

Remember though, as with all soft cases, protection is limited.  Soft cases are not for you if your bag or backpack is always overstuffed.

I like the Velcro closures at opposite ends of the flap.  The Velcro prevents the keyboard from slipping out of the sleeve and it is easy to access whenever I need to use the keyboard.  Zippers can be cumbersome when I am in a hurry

CONS:
Lint/paper dust shows up on the black canvas material.  However, it dusts off easily by hand.

The color black is fine for my needs.

I am ashamed to say just what was the first version of Windows I used but I will go on record stating that I have owned Windows 95, 98, ME and now Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry.
As it is an Upgrade, I suppose that is why there is no significant difference once I get going.  On the plus side however, there is a big improvement on starting up.  It loads almost immediately.

Moments of Ella, Peterson, some of Vaughan, some of typical Jazzanova trendyness. The balance is always maintained between a young edgyness you also find in EPs like ""Les Hommes"" or Nicolas Conte.

5469,"I purchased this along with the Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser. After I wash my face with the cleanser, I follow it up with this. The consistency is like water, and I would compare it to a toner or an astringent. However, this feels like it does that same job, but it is much less harsh feeling on my skin. I really like the fresh and clean smell it has to it.

I easily apply this by squirting a bit of this on a cotton ball and running it over my entire face.  I have combo skin type; dry in some places, but greasy in the T zone. This greatly improves my greasy areas while comfortably cleansing my dry areas. My skin feels fresh and not tight after using this. I have been using it for about a week now and I am happy with the results so far. I only use it once, at night, but because my skin does not seem to be drying out, I think I will also start using it in the morning when I wash my face. I am excited to keep using this for hopefully continued god results.

The product loses a star because the top of the noodles are still hard unless you flip them over during the microwave process.

I have never owned a canister vacuum did not think I would like dragging that bulbous canister around behind me. Not to worry. This has very mobile wheels on it and it just chases after me with no trouble at all. The only thing I did not plan on was the electrical cord NOT extending automatically as I pulled on the vacuum you have to feed it out. Suction: Holy Cow! This thing pulls out dirt that I did not know existed on hardwood floors, no less! My housekeeper just came Saturday and does a great job. Monday I used this to go back over the floors. In addition to the dog hair that was collected, there was a ton of very fine smaller than salt grains dirt collected from the floor. Amazing! The canister allows you to compress the dirt in the canister so that you do not have to remove it constantly, but can wait until it is truly full this is a very cool feature. The main vacuum sweeper portion is somewhat heavy I do not mind it let us me know its not cheap plastic. You have controls on the ""wand"" handle, allowing you to turn the machine on and off, turn the brush on and off and raise and lower the suction levels.

In my experience, uninstalling McAfee was always unnecessarily complicated this from a guy who majored in computer science and assembled his own PCs  it was almost as if you were expected to give up on installing and just pay them the money.  So I got this free copy which is just an empty envelope with a signup code.  Uninstalled Norton 360 which I have happily used for many years and tried to install McAfee.  I did not like the process.  I did not like giving them my credit card info was not this a free product and other stuff like my blood type.

5516,"Every so often, one sees a movie and says ""this is the best movie I have ever seenI probably will not see anything as moving as this. And sure enough, something comes along that is as good and many times better. The human condition is so varied and multifaceted that one may never exhaust all the permutations of artistic expression that can be shown. For example, when the TV science fiction hit ""Star Trek"" came out I thought it was so fantastic. But when ""ST The Next Generation"" came along, I had serious doubts that it could match the original. Then, as I marveled at the story lines and the extra dimension of character interactions, I felt that TNG is better and cannot be topped. With each iteration something new was introduced that explored the vastness of human interaction and interspecies interactions. Etc., Etc. GATTACA is yet another example of plumbing the depths of humanity, including out obsession with categorizing humans along the lines of artificial inventions like ""Race"", ""Caste System"", ""Colorism"". GATTACA is a haunting and beautifully conceived expression of the insanity that has had humanity in its grips for centuries and has made us into a species exemplified in the title of a book ""Homo Hierarchicus""by Louis Dumont One phrase that implies how illusory and meaningless these artifices is the one on the DVD cover that says""There is no gene for the human spirit"". Unfortunately, those of us who have become cynical about that inner essence of a human that makes us unique and gives expression to us being more than an accidental collection of sophisticated chemicals. Without that recognition of the ""soul"" oh humans, we become prey to seeing each other simply in terms of genes and eventually slide into the dark philosophies and practices of eugenics,",... but it's not enough to think of anything as good and many times better than this,An exploration of an aspect of the Human Condition

5522,"While many power users used to the more technical features of Office may find Office 2008 for Mac lacking, it works great for what I want it to do! Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc. Office 2008 for Mac just does that!

5533,"A great rockin' album, discovering it is a fullon experience since none of these songs are familiar, except maybe the cover ""If You Got To Make A Fool Of Somebody"". Opening track ""I Can Feel The Fire"" is a groovy reggaeish number, that has the voices of Ron, Mick and Keith on it, as close to an advance lineup of the current Stones as you are ever going to get. ""Far East Man"" is cowritten with George Harrison, who appears on this album to provide slide guitar and backing vocals Harrison released his own version on his own Dark Horse release of later that year. The song is kind of datedsounding, and comes off more as a Seventies softrocker Seals and Croft anyone?. It probably was not popular in the Wood/Stones camp, because it was left off the tour at least, it did not appear on ""The First Barbarians"". Mick Taylor plays bass! ""Mystifies Me"" is a great, throaty bluesy number that just zooms. Rod Stewart makes his first backing vocals appearance here wow, do Ron's vocals ever sound like Keith's! ""Take A Look At The Guy"" is a cool, funky, barroom rocker that sounds like similar stuff from the Faces, Keith plays electric guitar, Mick Taylor is on electric guitar, and Rod is backing. It is a funny song that comes off great live! ""Act Together"" is a Jagger/Richards composition that is really awesome, with great soulful lyrics. ""It is looking good, let us get our ssss together."" The Stones were never able to get their own version together, but it does not matter this one's great and so is the live version. Keith outdoes himself here, playing the electric guitar, electric piano, acoustic piano and singing. ""Am I Grooving You"" is a great, swampy tune with some wild","A funky, throaty blues...","Ron, you would have been better off doing a solo career than joining the Stones - this is proof!"

5541,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Great product!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

This is probably my favorite live recording, and has been for more than twenty years, and it still has not been released on DVD. Used VHS copies are available if you look. I do not know if the ones you will find these days are also bootleg, but there was an official VHS release and also a laserdisc release. As much as I dislike bootleggers, I cannot really fault them for keeping this recording available.

The video is really low quality, the audio is marginal, and the audio and video are out of sync. Make sure you check out the alternate audio tracks, because the default track is bad.

Cyndi's goofy and does not connect well with the French audience, and Rick Derringer is a dork here, but the performance is very good. Look for the 1987 NY Times review. It is a 1987 recording, so do not expect recent songs.

All the stars I am giving this are for the performance, which would rate 5star if it was a quality, official release.

They came in very quickly after I ordered and in the perfect packaging. I wrapped and gave them to my brother the next day as a house warming gift. They grill several times a week and are always looking to try something new. They are also the only people I know who has kabobs at least once a month. They called me this morning to let me know that they tried these out and how it went for them. They use a charcoal grill and made sure that the mat was not directly over any flame or at least any high flaring flames as best that they could. The cooking went well although sometimes the juice would go over an edge of the mat and because a flare up, but they had a small bowl of water next to the grill so they could quickly and easily put it out. No damage was done to the grill mat and they said that the burgers came out with the same grill taste but more juicy than normal. That was a big plus for them. My brother said that he will try it a few more times to see if he can perfect the best way to use it.

You have a pretty nifty yacht and a companion on board that gives you the scoop. You control the boat by going to the cabin where you can record the species you discover and get new gear and receive e mails on your mobileand you dive!

You can dive day or night provided you get the night goggles and as you interact with the sea creatures you learn about them. You also can take people on dives who are thrilled to be discovering the sea with you.

You have a nice big map of an area to investigate and you can navigate the boat anywhere you would like. You search for species and try to find rare treasures when you dive. There is no time race, no fighting; it is truly relaxing and informational, not a stress laced beat them up type noisy game.

I got a cd recently of old time radio shows so I turned that on, turned the music off of Endless Ocean though the music is relaxing and very calm, and listened to my cd as I swam through the ocean and had a very nice time!

The graphics are great  you can even sit on the deck chair and look off into the distance to take a break from diving.

Pure roots rock, no jamming, no showboating, just raw playing talent and great songwriting.  You know the music if you have ever turned on a radio.  Now, listen to them the way you should have all along.  A fantastic remaster, fully worth the money.  Highly recommended.  If you have the old Fantasy discs, sell them and buy this series.

Five swabs later, I was able to declare victory over dust. Or, at least have not noticed any of the abomination on the photographs yet.

I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.

I have never had an OPI polish streak, clump, or lose ""hairs"" from the brushes like with other polish brands, and the colors are rich and gorgeous.

This polish is my new favorite neutral. It is opaque and matte, with just the usual nail polish shine, but no shimmer or glitter. The color is a nice rosy mauve that is somewhere between pink and brown. It is a good yearround color for my pale, olivetoned skin, and I can imagine it might be flattering on many skin tones. I had hoped it might be slightly more purple, but although there seems to be a lavender undertone the overall color is more pink/mauve.","Good choice for my pale, olivetoned skin",The Perfect Neutral Mauve Pink

5630,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

5641,"This is a replacement for two similar poles purchased at least 6 years ago, perhaps ten.  The older one is blue with gold trim, the one not so old is dark red with gold trim.  Both are three section, twist lock.  The older one I have used for day hikes in easy terrain.  The other my wife began using when she began walking with me.  For both near the end of the season last year the locking mechanism began to fail.  I bought this one for my wife, I had other poles of staffs to use. The new one comes with a three year warranty and past experience with Komperdell tells me I will not need it.

This one is two sections, not three and the locking mechanism is an exterior clamp.  I think this is probably more secure and fixable, compared to the twist lock.  I really like the infinite length adjusment, compared to the popout button that fits into a series of holes in the shaft.  It is nice to be able change the length to exactly what I want.  Sometimes as little as a quarter of an inch makes a difference.

5647,"In spite of my love of apocalyptic stories, I am not a fan of zombies. I have never read a zombie book with a good explanation for the actions and behaviors of said zombies e.g. eating people, and that bugs me when I am reading. After does what no other zombie book has. Okay, so they are not real zombies in the traditional sense. No actual eating people. However, an explanation for both the change itself AND for the behaviors of the changed people afterwards had me cheering.

The story followed 3 primary groups of people as they escape from the changed people. Towards the end of this book, we see how all three groups will eventually come together in a future book, I assume. At times, the story seemed slow, and the requisite prepper character in the story had a few too many explanatory soliloquies. Other than that, I mostly enjoyed the different characters and how their actions shape them.

The narrator of the audiobook was decent. He certainly did not detract from the story in any way, neither did he do anything to really add to the story. I would listen to this narrator again.

I would definitely continue reading the series.

5650,"Box works exactly as it is intended. When setting it up, however, one must have a Google Voice account and an assigned phone number from GV both set up FIRST in order to successfully follow the given set up process... Obi's online instructions will let you link the OBi202's registration to a nonexistent GV account and tells you to do a test call, which does not work unless the GV account is set up first. Once I figured this out, the rest of the checkout and subsequent use went smoothly. When you compare the voice quality to other VoIP phone services, one notices slight differences: 1. A sharp ear will detect slightly lower voice quality...but hey...not bad for free!!! It is still really quite good audio. 2. If in a conversation where the two talkers need to ""seize the voice path"" and interrupt each other at times during their dialogue, it seems as if the ""switching"" is a bit difficult. This can result in occasional ""What?s"" and ""Pardon me's?"" In other words, the conversation flow just does not seem as smooth as with my paidmonthly VoIP service operating on the same Internet connection and router. One other thing I wonder about is that since the Obi box is Chinesesourced, and needs to be registered through THEIR SITE AND obviously run through THEIR SERVER since that is what authenticates your box, and links to Google, IS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TAPPING INTO MY CALLS? In today's day and age of cyber warfare and cyber attack potential on the US Power Grid and control of the water supply, I am just wary and suspicious of ""free services"".

Her books captivate the reader. The characters are larger than life and their personalities jump off the pages. The stories are very realistic, compassionate, steamy, and romantic. Her writing style is smooth and keeps the readers attention. I am amazed how J. S. Cooper keeps coming up with books that capture the heart. Everlasting Sin held me prisoner until the very last word. Thank you J. S. Cooper for delivering another magical book!

Everlasting Sin is a story of love that starts from childhood. It is a lifetime journey of two people destined to be together. Their hearts belong to one another.

5663,"...Well, technically, it IS drone doom. The reason I say it is not is because of how UNIQUE it is to the genre of drone doom. Other drone bands, like Sunn O, Boris, and Earth tend to sound the same. This is not a bad thing they just all sound the same. Khanate, however, brings something new to the table in this particular genre. The music is still plodding, slow and monolithic, but there is an indescribable uniqueness to the music of this album that it pushes the boundaries of drone. In fact, the only thing I can say sounds even REMOTELY similar to the above bands is the 6 minute riff at the beginning of ""Under Rotting Sky"". I will get to that later. Now, enough with the comparisons. I am here to discuss the music your mileage may vary if it IS music or not of Khanate, a band which will shape doom metal for generations to come. By the way, Stephen O Malley, the guitarist for Sunn O, is in this band. Khanate are quite possibly the most disturbing, claustrophobic band ever to hit the recording studio. That is the understatement of the century. The vocals of Alan Dublin are harsh shrieks, though not in the black metal sense. The shrieks on this album sound like a defensive animal it is truly unnerving. The twisted lyrics of the band contribute to this aspect. The bass is loud and crunchy, much like Al Cisneros' bass on Om, only they are even heavier. The drumming does not attribute to the scariness of this band but is a key instrument and is very dare I say it while discussing this band of all bands entertaining to listen to. In fact, despite the terror that emmits from this album, it is",The Band was a bit disturbing but not for the price,"""Drone Doom"" is not what this album is."

This is my first experience with Pinnacle Studio in any form, however, I am not new to video editing about 50 videos on YouTube. I have tried several video editors over the years and chose AVS Video Editor because it is both comprehensive and easy to use, but this is a good alternative and I am sure I will use it again. In fact, I am very glad to have this option. When you open the program for the first time, you will get a notice recommending you download the patchs to the program.

But do not try to use the program without first downloading and installing the patches. If you are new to video editing, Pinnacle Studio 18 would be a good program to start with. Pinnacle makes it simple: Open the program, click on ""Organizer"" , one of the mode options in the header along with ""Edit"" and ""Author"", upload photos and video from your camera or computer to the organizer, click on ""Smart Movie"" on the bottom of the page, follow the instructions when the ""smart movie"" maker slides up, edit if you feel up to it by clicking on the ""edit"" button, then when ready, either with or without editing, click on ""export"" to start the production of your masterpiece.

I personally was not angry or upset dismayed of course that she decided to kill off Jeffrey.

It was like reading 99 of one book, and then finding another book and reading the last two pages.  Huh???  Maybe it will be linked up in the next volume, but I did not like the writing style that drove this.  I confess I had read the reviews first, and knew what to expect, so was very annoyed as the author was painstaking to repeat numerous times, using a variety of words,  how Sara felt she could not live without Jeffery.

All of his powers are fun and important in the game, and I never get bored of blasting cars and throwing them into the air.

Pros:
Stellar graphics
Awesome powers
Free roam
Jumping from tall buildings gives me a rush
Intriguing story line
Several different types of enemies keeps the gameplay and fighting from getting boring
Ability to choose to be ""Good"" or ""Bad"" with powers that adjust accordingly was great.

Cons:
The game is not never ending Wink or smirk

All in all this is one of my favorites for the PS3. I played through the game the first time as the ""Good"" Cole and your superpowers strengthen as you play through the game. Second time around was the ""Evil"" Cole, and this was also fun. There are slight differences between the Good and Evil powers I personally thought the good were more entertaining. Enough difference to warrant a second and maybe even third play through like I did.

We mainly use this to keep track of accounting for parts purchases and sales.  It has lots of reports and metrics for looking at numbers.

Coming from Quickbooks, I found the software bug free, easy to install and easy to learn how to use with some minimal research online.  The user interface is a bit early 2000's Windowsish but it gets the job done.

5698,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit and worth it!,good kit with some caveats

5709,"This is my second motorola headset. The volume is very good. I am able to hear conversations easily at low volume levels even in windy conditions. People I have spoken too indicate that they hear very little back ground noise. The flip open boom works well...and it is very easy to tell if the headset is off. Very lightweight. The ear gels take a little getting use too.....but they work well. The ability to connect to 2 phones at one is nice. I use this feature every day to connect my work phone and personal phone. The range is reasonable...easily out at the 30 ft range. The mototalk program is awful.....I uninstalled it and use the built in features in my motorola photon instead. Update February 2013, Now that I have had the opportunity to use this headset for a while I am still very pleased. It has been very durable, still works great. I have it paired to 2 phones at all times personal and work phone. Volume is still great. One thing I found out.....in noisy areas.....DO NOT CUP YOUR HAND OVER THE HEADSET. It throws off the sound cancellation technology and will kill the ears of the person on the other end of your phone call. The sound cancelling works well...people can usually tell that I am in a store or something...but they can still hear me very clearly. Wind is the same normally. My brother has now also purchased one of these headsets and has also been very happy with it.

And then I realize that there is a dialogue going on between boy and bunny, with purple print for the bunny and blue print for the boy. But this difference might not show up on some ebooks readers. So I would suggest the author find a clear way to design this dialogue between boy and bunny. I think that would improve the story considerably.

Once I understood this dialogue, I enjoyed rereading the story. If an older person reads this story to a child, he should do so in two different voices, one for bunny and one for boy.

I really liked the main characters brother, but once they picked up the ogre, his role started disappearing , and once they paired up with the land pirates, he became practically nonexistent. Which was a shame because he was hilarious.
Now, I also really liked the pirate couple. They are very grey characters, neither mostly good nor bad. But still rather funny.
The only thing that irritated me was the heroines refusal to talk with the hero the ogre. While mildly amusing at first, it quickly became tiresome. There were misunderstandings galore that could have been cleared up easily and quickly with a single conversation. Which happens near the end of the book. It was frustrating.

They are also too thin, and one of the battery pads pulled off and broke immediately after a medium crash. I scraped off some of the black coating next to it to get the battery lead reattached, but it will not hold up. Also, the screw holes for the arms on the bottom pate are too close to the edge, so they started snapping off. I noticed it right away when I was assembling it, thinking ""this is going to be a problem"" and sure enough it was. The screws used were of poor manufacture with 1 in 5 having misshapen hex sockets that do not allow the hex tool to engage properly. If I had used thread locker I am sure that I would be unable to remove them. The arms are great, after 4 crashes they barely show any damage. Also the top plate is CF and has held up beautifully.

I just started using it so I am not sure how long it will take to use up the 75 strips that come with the unit since I normally use a regular roll of tape.

There is one little flaw with the design. There is VERY LITTLE force holding the valve body latched at the right adjusted height. Turn the top just a bit so easy to do and the water pressure in it will force the thing into maximum extension, causing the toilet to run without stop. Those of you with kids, grand kids, neighbor kids, and so on understand full well that someone will eventually play in your toilet tank.

5750,"I have used my different antivirus and security applications on many different computers over the years, and I am reasonably impressed with Trend Micro Internet Security Pro. The application is easy to install, it is easy to adjust the settings to fit your needs, it automatically updates regularly, and it identifies threats that some other applications miss. I have been running two other security and antivirus applications on my computer over the last year and neither of those programs identified a Trojan Horse that had been installed on my computer. After I installed Trend Micro Internet Security, it immediately identified the Trojan Horse and quarantined the file to protect my computer. I did a Google search to find out more about the quarantined file to make sure it was a Trojan Horse and not a safe file that was misidentified and sure enough it is a known malware/Trojan Horse file that compromised my computer's security. Thankfully, this application identified it and got rid of it. Now, here are the minor problems I have with Trend Micro Internet Security: First, even if I set the application to only update at a specific time it will sometimes update immediately after reboot even if it has already updated the security software that day. This is good if you want to make sure your security files/virus definitions are up to date, but it stinks if you do not want the program downloading updates all the time. Second, depending on the number of startup applications I have running on my system, Trend Micro Internet Security Pro sometimes generates a strange error message telling me to stay off the internet until my parents have changed the parental controls.

5791,"This external battery pack works great. It is 5000 ma hours so it has power to spare. It will recharge my iTouch from 35 times. I would like to see a couple of design improvements though. It would be nice if the adapter that connected with the iTouch accepted the power cable at a right angle instead of straight out from the bottom. It is fine in its current design, but my idea would make it so much better. Also, because the adapter that is used to plug into the iTouch is used for multiple purposes it would be nice if they put velcro on it so you could attach it to the device when not in use. The connector could get lost so I put a small piece of velcro on it and on the coil wire holder. Now when the connector is not being used it is stuck to the wire assembly so it cannot get lost.

I give this external battery pack five stars because it works exactly as it is supposed to. It charges quickly and it remains charged for a long time. It will charge my iTouch many times before having to be recharged itself.",Works great. It is 5000 ma hours so it has power to spare,Works Great!

5815,"I guess I am late on the bandwagon as I just picked this book up the other day.  It is a very quicky and easy read.  I did not necessarily think it was ""hysterical"", but it had it is moments where I was highly amused.
I think this book comically conveys that society as a whole expect that women, once in their thirties, to get married and start having children.  And if they do not, then they are unhappy.  And then there is the other side of the coin  the married thirtysomething is, although somewhat content in their married lives, sometimes wish they were single again as they crave that freedom of singledom.  A doubleedged sword.  I believe it portrays a very realistic view of those expectations as well as  the flaws in both of those generalizations.
Some people may see this book as a stereotypical view of women.  A thirtysomething women is obsessed about her weight, men, smoking, being alone.  But have not all women, at one time or another, experienced those same apprehensions?  I know that I have.  While I have never gone to the extreme that Bridget has, I can relate.  And so, I relished with great interest, what would happen to Bridget next.  I also liked the group of people around Bridget, it was good to see that see had such good friends.

It did not curl for me here is what you need to do:

1 When you receive the product let it come to room temperature before you take it out of the packaging.
2 DO NOT REMOVE THE BACKING.
3 Lay the ""3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface"" where you are planning to use it and use it for a couple of hours. This will make sure that it is flattened out.
4Clean the surface where you you will be using it and remove the backing from the ""3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface"" and lay it flat, proceed to smooth it out.
5 DONE!

Going to the ""3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface"" was a change for me as i used to use a pad which was much softer.

Molly Moon was just another orphan living at Hardwick House. She was always being picked on by the other kids and was tormented by the headmaster, Ms. Adderstone. Molly only had one friend and would often spend her time being punished for things like taking a bath with too much water or being bullied by Hazel Hackersky. To make matters worse, her best friend Rocky was adopted from the orphanage and taken to New York with a new family.
But one day, Molly's bad luck changes for the better. She discovers a mysterious old book entitled ""Hypnotism,"" written by a hypnosist expert. Molly first tested it out by hypnotizing the orphnage's dog, Petula, and discovered she was a natural. She even won two thousand pounds at a local talent show and decided to put her earnings to use. After hyptotizing both Miss Adderstone and the orphanage's cook into liking her, Molly decides to go to New York and try to find Rocky. But before you can say ""hypnotism,"" Molly is staying at the most expensive hotel in New York City and earning fortythousand dollars a month by being the star of a hit Broadway musical. But that is not all a stranger determined to get the book is watching Molly and plotting a plan to get that book...
This is an excellent book for ages 812. It is mixed with humor, sadness, and happiness all at the same time. Readers will be cheering for the impressible Molly, who has the adventure of her life in this book.",This is Georgia Byng's first novel and I am extremely impressed with it...,Fantastic book!

The styles are certainly a stretch from the other, but somehow Norah's voice ties it all together in a pretty little musical bow.

Perhaps because it is ""the"" season, my favorite track is ""Baby It is Cold Outside,"" a collaboration of Norah Jones and Willie Nelson, followed by ""Dear John"" by Ryan Adams featuring Norah Jones.

Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent ""Laughing City"" and ""Marvelous Things"". For whatever reason, it is taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour.

""Room Noises"" 12 tracks, 41 min. is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener ""Memories"", ""I Was not Prepared"", ""Memories"" the standout track of the album, and ""Brightly Wounded"" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are ""Plenty of Paper"", a great uptempo song, and the closer ""Trolley Wood"".

What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs in newly recorded versions, and that is disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track a remixed version of ""Lost at Sea"" but the CD I bought does not have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I cannot wait to see them live!

5870,"And also way too simplistic.

First of all, why do certain authors seem to think that the way to establish the main character as sympathetic and likeable is by running down nearly every other character in the book? In fact, it has the opposite effect, particularly here with the downright nastiness used in portraying the main character's cousin and her family, as much of their characterization comes from her point of view. It is not just the cousin, however  apart from the de rigeur ex cop potential romantic interest, just about every other character comes across as stupid, mean or both.

Also what little mystery there was, was fairly obvious from.the start, and the ending seemed pretty deus ex machina. Oh, and the cutesy bits told from a kitten's POV? The cat does not figure much at all in the book, so these seemed like nothing more than an attempt to cram in as many cozy clichs as possible. All the book needed was a cupcake recipe or some crafting tips, then it really would have managed the all time clich championship.",An interesting way to establish the main character as sympathetic and likeable,Just Mean-Spirited

5872,"I much prefer eyelining pencils over all the powders and ""paint on"" varieties that have come out in recent years. Call me old fashioned. If you are like me, and have owned a few dozen different brands over the decades, then you will understand the frustration of finding a great liner, only to have the wood shaft of the pencil splinter when you sharpen it. Cheap wood the bane of pencils of all varieties. When I opened the cap on this liner I was delighted to see a very tight grained light colored wood. I itched to sharpen it right away. I used a basic sharpener and cannot tell you the happiness I felt to shave the thinnest curls of wood off the pencil. This is made possible by the tight grain of the premium wood they encased this lovely liner inside not by an extraordinary blade. And the liner? Shade 01 is the deepest pitch black I have seen in a very long time. The pigment is super saturated so your lines are consistent from beginning to end. It goes on very smoothly and it resists smudging and moisture for hours. It comes off when you take it off. With sharpening you can create a super fine tip for the thinnest lines, or you can use it the way it comes for a medium width line. The color is even and lasts all day without problem. I am addicted and buying the other color too. I love it. Added Jan 24, 2015: So I bought color 2 not really knowing what color to expect. I was not sure from the pictures if it was brown or a shade of grey. It is definitely not brown. It is a dark grey or a lighter black than 1.

5897,"If you are looking for an easy to use replacement for your garlic press, and regularly have a cutting board or butchers block on your counter, this is a vast improvement from the lever type crush. Those things are terrible to clean and always ooze garlic out the side. This cheap little replacement creates little pellets or garlic, slightly larger than most presses, but it mashes the flesh much less. Some chunks of garlic may be pushed to the side, especially if the clove is large, but you just have to push it back under, and rock it again. I ran a full head of garlic through it today to make tilapia with fried garlic and it took less than a minute. I really like the pellet size. To clean it, just run it under water. And, since it is stainless steel, if you rub your hands with it the smell disappears. I use it to remove garlic odor even in I process the garlic differently; got to love a multitasker. To address the negative reviews: Yes, some garlic sticks in the holes, but same with any garlic press, and much less with this model. Plus, you can just knock it out on the board. Easy. Any one who think mincing garlic with a knife is easier than this either has magic knifes that do not allow garlic to stick at all, or are WAY more skilled than I, and I can mince an onion in less than 20 sec. Besides, it is not ment to replace a knife, it is ment to replace those awful garlic presses. If you like your garlic press, do not buy this.

To the contrary, during this time he released the introspective Guilt Machine project in 2009 featuring young vocal phenomenon Jasper Steverlinck, the second Star One metal album in 2010, and the hugely successful solo album entitled Lost in the New Real a psychedelic rock ride full of prophetic ""tongueincheek"" commentary on the future. Even though Arjen laid to rest the original Ayreon saga back in 2008, fans always knew that Ayreon would be resurrected one day. As promised by Arjen himself, he is reinventing Ayreon in 2013 with this new story partly inspired by A Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and the movie Rain Main. The story here is actually a story based in human experience more than science fiction and takes place in the present time. In this regard it shares more in common with Ayreon's The Human Equation 2004 than it does with any of the other Ayreon releases. And while this is clearly the least lyrically/vocally dense Ayreon release to date, the format stays true to form. This time around, however, there are only 7 characters, but they are once again portrayed by various vocal talents, both old and new, which is the Ayreon way. Most noteworthy here are Cristina Scabbia Lacuna Coil, Marco Hietala Nightwish, and Kamelot's new sensation Tommy Karevikho who plays the Prodigy main character.

They had been apart for almost ten years, and during that time they all released a number of solo or minigroup albums, if not always successful Bell Biv DeVoe and Ralph Tresvant both fell victim to the sophomore jinx. But this was the first time all six members were there, so it supposedly would signify a new sound. One good thing is, of course, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis writing many of the stellar songs like ""I am Still In Love With You"" and the title track. And another good thing is that we were reintroduced to the group through the first two tracks: ""Oh Yeah, It Feels So Good"" and ""Hit Me Off"". But as you listen to the rest of the album it feels like something is missing. I think that something is more of Johnny Gill's vocals. True, Ralph is the lead singer, and Bobby is second according to magazines, but I personally do not agree with that, but think back for a minute. When you played New Edition's 1989 album Heart Break, whose voice were you REALLY listening to? You heard that booming voice at the end of the title track, and you knew that was not Ralph. I know this may be unfair, but if Johnny is going to be a background singer in a song, what is the point of even having him there? LSG is an exception.

  The Sims 2 will be coming out for PC in February of 2004 and it looks to outdo the previous versions as Maxis is redoing the engine 3D. I only mention that here because I am hoping that they incorporate features from Bustin Out to Sims 2. Will they? EA and Maxis are keeping mum on most features.
  In conclusion, The Sims: Bustin Out is an enjoyable game and I reccommend it for any Sim fan out there. If you have a gamecube then connect it to your gba and unlock Paradise island and transfer your sim back and forth from each version. If your just playing the GBA version like me, the Paradise Island is just mentioned and not seen.
  Still a great game regardless of what you have and highely recomended. ENJOY!!!! Soong Soong!!! Happy face or smiley",The Sims: Bustin Out is the first GBA game,"A Gameboy Version? Yup, It Seems There Everywhere!!!"

5952,"This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.

I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really did not know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I did not know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.

Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.

If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I do not see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross section of the population.",A good read for the younger female market,Attention Female Shoppers
5953,"Watching the videos of the BF3, you get a real sense that DICE attempted to take the franchise to the next level. While the game's problems are numerous, it is quite gorgeous to look at. The Frostbite 2 engine delivers. The sound is also exceptional. But that is where the praise must end. There are severe mechanic issues and underlying problems. Because of the ""see your legs as you run"" dynamic, movement in this game is far more cumbersome than any other BF game. The fluidity is gone, and we are left with a clunky, herkyjerky experience. It seems as if DICE upped the realism angle, but only in ways that do not enrich the gameplay experience. It only seems to hurt the sense that you are in control of your character. Annoying aspects, like getting hung up on a brick or trash can, while your guy does his best hurdleinplace. While this is going on, you lose your line of sight. A problem for players who want to stay aware of his surroundings. There are multiple map balance issues. In certain cases, only one side wins according to initial spawn position. Unlike BF2, where the weapons were gradually increased and a modicum of balance remained now, you have got wildly overpowered weapons for those players who rich the midpoint of leveling. This is frustrating for newer players, since they have little to no chance to remain competitive. The incentive to level is undermined by the frustrating weapon balance issues. As for Origin, it is a highly problematic, buggy interface. Unlike Steam and previous BF games, Origin opts for a web browser engine. Crashes are numerous through the client alone. The game itself is riddled with bugs and the anticheat software Punkbuster only exacerbates the problems, while doing little to",A great game that has a lot of energy and fun to watch.,A Real Shame

HOWEVER, about halfway through the first screw, all of a sudden the blade part drops to the ground.  What the heck?  So, I look at it and the metal easy lock clasp is still firmly on the head of the shaft but the blade has, at the junction between the blade and the locking clasp, detached!

This game seems like it would be more fun playing with 2, 3, or 4 people. I played BLS by myself, and had a pretty good time. When I first turned it on, I fielded in baseball. I have to admit, I was ready to give this game one star. The ball is hard to see when it is coming at you. There are flashing lights from the stands imitating cameras I guess, and baseballs were coming at me, and I could not see them until they hit the ground. Then I tried the pitching. I really did not understand what the game was asking for, but I think I figured out that the game does not want you to pitch when the moving square is in the middle. I was highly disappointed and frustrated at this point in the game. This was in the baseball tournament mode. I feel this part of the game was not well planned out, but maybe I just do not understand it. Then I tried the Homerun Hero mode, and I fell in love. If you ever played EA Sports Active for the WIi, and remember swinging the baseball bat, and always thought that this mode should be expanded on, your dreams have come true.

It was listed as 10mm peg hole but came with the vintage drilling which is what I wanted. I checked the peg spacing and shape against my vintage template and it matched up to the 50s/60s shape. The heel had plenty of meat for fitting. If you want a bolt on, this is not for you. You need some good skills to fit it properly. It needed to be taken down on the sides and bottom. Holes needed to be drilled. Once I had it fitted and bolted on, I checked it. The fret work was fine and the fret size was equivalent to what comes on Mexican telecasters. The radius was probably 12"" or pretty flat. My frets were level as it came. It also came with dings in the back side. It came from China packaged in bubblewrap and plastic shipping bag. It looked alright. My guess is these are banged up in some factory so they just sell them off rather than use them. Otherwise it would likely be banged up where it counts. The fretboard and peghead were fine. I will rework the neck somewhat but it has enough so I can get the 50s profile I am after. I intended to pull the frets and do a compound radius and install jumbo frets. Then put a decal and finish it with amber nitro.

The main characters were portrayed flawlessly, with both, Meredith and Hutch, carrying a lot of baggage with them, but even so, them growing fond of each other, learning to trust each other, and ultimately loving each other was written in a way that felt real and meaningful. Particularly Meredith was an inspiring individual with her strength and determination obvious in her every action. She is an inspiration for abused women everywhere. Her courage is aweinspiring. Hutch, too, finds himself at a crossroads at the point in life when we meet him. Without his genuine goodness and the bitter, but important life experience that he has, his life could easily turn for the worse. Instead, he makes the right choice and it leads him to love, loyalty and a new beginning. As a character, he went from a gruff, hurting ex military to an understanding, supportive and loving family man smoothly. His portrayal never once stumbled, it was very genuine. What bothered me a bit was the overly positive portrayal of most of the side characters. The town of Twilight simply seemed too dreamy and ideal to be believable. I tripped over that quite a few times while reading, but the tight and suspenseful plot pulled me right back in.

6031,"This item is hard to find a good description of online. The packaging was different than pictured. This was YardGuard Brand by Gilbert and Bennett distributed by Midwest Air Technologies. the netting is pretty much like bird net but in 84""x100 foot roll folded in half on the roll. The squares are tiny  more like 1/2 inch rather than the 3/4 inch as advertized. It can easily be cut with scissors.
I am using this because of the price 200 feet for under 50 bucks. I bought 2 rolls for my garden and stapled to landscape timbers set in cement on about 12 foot center. It was easy enough for me to put up by myself with a staple gun and a step stool in about 3 hours.
Purpose is for light deer control in western Washington mule deer  SORY... edit to blacktail. They have lots of forest and other things that take less effort to get to rather than calculating how to jump the 7 foot mesh fence. I only had 2 breaks caused by the staple cutting the plastic while installing the 200 feet.  May post a review later in season to see how it actually holds up to the critters.

UPDATE: deer jumped right through it   put a big rip right in the middle. I will be getting stronger more expensive fence this time. Can still use this stuff as temp fence and over shrubs etc... Not for dogs or deer. dragonflies get stuck in it  had to rescue about a dozen dragonflies from this stuff.",Very nice package,just cheap netting

6050,"I have been playing NBA 2K since the original release for the Sega Dreamcast. I do not return video games often, but I had to return 2K15.

I play about 90 in MyPlayer mode and this version does a few things that are really annoying. They made it so MyPlayer requires a constant connection to NBA2K servers for no good reason. Well guess what, these guys have no clue how keep their servers up and running so MyPlayer will literally stop a game in progress and return to the menu screen. From there you can launch back into MyPlayer mode, which will take you right back to the start of the game folks. It does not save your game progress!

You could literally be having the game of your life with 1 minute to go in OT, and then BOOM, NBA2K detects a server connection issue and its like the game never happened. This is just horrible software design, and the fact that they cannot keep a simple web service up in the year 2015 is inexcusably bad.

The really sad part about this is the gameplay is great, and the graphics look sharp, but that does not matter when the game is absolutely crippled because  of poor software design, bad quality assurance testing, and laughably bad web service infrastructure design.",Great game,2K Games can't keep their Servers up

6072,"I got this record for Christmas from my mom. For the last thirty years, I have gotten one almost every year. I own every album George Strait has ever recorded. He is been my favorite singer since I first heard him on the radio with ""Amarillo By Morning"". I have seen him four or five times in concert. As far as I am concerned, nobody does it better. This album is one of his best ones in several years.

This is an unusual record for George in a couple aspects. First of all, he cowrote many of these songs. George has not ever written much. He has writing credits on a bunch of these songs, and his son, Bubba, is on there with him for some.

There are a few tremendous songs on here. ""Drinkin' Man"" is one of the ones he wrote with Bubba. It follows an alcoholic through his life and looks at how drinking has affected it. That is a really good song. ""A Showman's Life"" is another great one. It looks at how the dream can be so different from the reality. Finally, ""I will Always Remember You"" is a restrospective of his amazing career and a thank you to his fans. It almost sounds like a swansong.

All I can say is I hope not. I liked this album very much.",Best song for George Strait,King George is still doing it!

6086,"The maps in this product and Microsoft Streets Trips 2009 are the same and both are awful. They are incredibly outdated, incomplete and errorridden. On a recent trip, I was navigating. In a car moving at expressway speeds, the results in the search box were impossible to read because the type is so small. The address I was looking for is a house that was built in 1993. Neither it nor the surrounding community are to be found on the these maps. In my own area, within a six block radius, both MapPoint 2009 and Streets Trips 2009 list four restaurants that closed three or more years ago. Another restaurant, which has been located at its current location for at least ten years, is still shown at its former location a couple of miles away. Such inaccuracies are unacceptable.

6087,"Dermablend Quick Fix Concealer is a very smooth silky feeling product that glides on with no dry feeling, no pulling of undereye skin, no pilling, and no distortion in color. It goes on evenly and stays throughout the day on the face. I do not know how well it would wear on other areas if one were to sweat.

The tube is handy to toss in your purse or leave on the bathroom countertop. It looks like a thin lipstick tube although a little longer. The product comes out of the tube the same way a lipstick comes out  by turning the bottom until you have a small amount out. It is easy to apply either directly or by applying with clean fingers.

6098,"""Black and Blue"" might not be to the taste of rockers who expect every Stones album to trot out another ""If You Cannot Rock Me"" or ""Rocks Off"", but I have always found it to be a refreshing change. Listen to the samples, you will see what I mean. The samples do not do justice to every song here but you will get an idea of this album's groove. Song for song I prefer it over ""Goats Head Soup"" or ""It is Only Rock  Roll"" although both of those do have a number of Stones classics. And ""Some Girls"", half its album cuts sound boilerplate thirty years on, but of the eight songs on ""Black and Blue"", the only throwaway would be ""Crazy Mama"".

The track most frequently included on my car CD compilations is the funky workout ""Hey Negrita"", with ""Hot Stuff"" a close runnerup. It is worth noting that most collections like ""40 Licks"" or whatever it was called include the edited single versions of ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Fool to Cry"". ""Melody"" is another favorite, distinctive within the Stones' catalog, a good song for hanging out with friends late at night. Years later UB40 would also cover ""Cherry Oh Baby"", but listen and compare, see if you do not agree that the Stones version is far better.

If you have picked up a few Stones albums and you are at risk of tiring of their sound or you think you have what you need already, try ""Black and Blue"" on for size. After the four albums that are the pinnacle of their career  Exile, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Beggars Banquet  this would be the next one on my list.",A great rocker's touch,Favorite of the Stones' post-Exile albums

6102,"""Message in the Bottle"" is, like the tagline suggests, a tale of love lost and found. The way I was introduced to this film is rather interesting, I suppose. Many years ago I came across it when I was searching online for information regarding the 1977 classic Disney film ""a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/TheRescuers/dp/B000096IAI/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""The Rescuers/a."" Both films share the theme of the ""message in the bottle"" so the connection lead me to this 1999 film. Finally, I saw it for sale in a grocery store's bargain DVD bin and just had to bring it home with me, so I did. I could not have been more pleased. The film is touching in many ways, beautifully filmed, with fantastic characters and great acting. It is a refreshing tale of love that does leave a bittersweet impact, and probably will not be forgotten easily. It is also interesting that I found this film so captivating, because romance tales have never really been of interest to me. Emily Bront's novel, ""a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/WutheringHeights/dp/0140366946/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Wuthering Heights/a,"" was the first time I felt interested in a story of love, enough to keep me reading, very intrigued, through its hundreds of pages. ""Message in a Bottle"" did the same thing, it intrigued me. The gorgeously filmed sceneries automatically appealed to me; sights of lighthouses, docks and ships, ships out at sea, ocean waves, beautiful sunsets... not to forget the message in the bottle. To me it was like watching one of Thomas Kinkade's paintings come to life right before my eyes; the sceneries in this film are that beautiful. This is the story of a young woman named Theresa, who works for the Chicago Tribune. She and her exhusband had recently divorced and the two exchanged the time they would spend with their one son. One day,",A good story of love,Ocean waves and gorgeous sceneries surround this unique and refreshing love story...
6103,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",great kit,good kit with some caveats

I tried plain round brass saddles, Wilkinson compensated saddles, even ponied up serious cash and bought a Glendale bridge and their highly touted saddles.  The Glendale was a complete bust, sounding worse than any other combination I used.  I finally decided to give these a try and I am simply floored at the difference.  These TOWER above all the other stuff I have tried.  The saddles give a rich, smooth sound while retaining the telecaster vibe.  The notes are MUCH more clearly defined and the overall harmonic blend just blows the brass saddles away.

The title is White Hot, and it is SERIOUSLY hot. fans self The Andrews team always has successful Urban Fantasies, and this one is no different! You Will definitely have to pick up the first book, Burn For Me, before starting this one, though. Not only does Andrews explore family dynamics with Nevadas loving and large family, but it also focuses on the slow burn romance with Mad Rogan, as well as a discovery of Nevadas power that could change the path of her life. The world is really intricate, and so is the magic system, making for a compelling read that will never have a boring moment. In White Hot, we follow Nevada Baylors story as a private investigator in a world where magicwielders are at the top of the hierarchy. Her power is to discern whether people are telling the truth or not, which works well with her occupation. But throughout the series and especially in book 2, Nevada discovers that her power might be a bit more and sees changes in her simple PI life because of these discoveries. However, what stays consistent is the love and support she receives from her family, who are absolutely rambunctious and brimming with energy and optimism. Whether its Nevadas lovable younger cousin who craves for adventure or grandma that is full of boundless enthusiasm, each member was drawn out pretty well and you can really tell the depths of their love to each other. Another relationship that is explored really well in the book is the rather slow burn romance with Nevada and Rogan.

6131,"I had gotten a sample of this ink from Goulet Pens and fell in love with it....however the price there and everywhere else I looked was exorbitant.  Then I found it here for quite a significant savings...the only drawback was there was a two month long wait since it was being shipped on a slow boat from Japan.  However, because I had already gotten two sample vials of ink, I was able to ink the pen I wanted to use it in a Monteverde Artista and the samples, fortunately lasted until the ink finally arrived in the mail one day after I despaired of ever receiving it.  Now, one would think that with that long wait, that it would affect my rating of this ink...however I love the ink so much that it was well worth the wait and I am so grateful to have been able to purchase it for an affordable price that both of these factors made up for the hassle of the wait and I still am giving it a five star rating.  I would advise you to do as I did and purchase some samples of the ink to hold you over as well as to see if you love it as much as I do.",What a great price,Worth the Wait
6132,"I had used their counterspy product and had been impressed with it.  I had been meaning to try out vipre for awhile.

The installer is small and it was easy to install the package.

The deep scan was pretty quick.  Did not time it against AVERAGE but I think it was faster and it found a couple things AVERAGE missed.  The basic package will take care of viral and malware problems.  I will say the malware detector is far better then Symantec and McAfeeused both.

There was not a way to centrally manage several installations but this is a home edition so that function is not needed as much as it would be in a corporate environment.

The automation aspects are easy.  As with most packages you can automate the downloads of new dictionaries and scans.

Overall, this was an easy test and I am going to consider upgrading to the premium edition and get the firewall.

For Lucia Lewis, a trip to Vegas was meant to let go of her inhibitions and have a wild onenight with a stranger while crossing off her Post It fantasy list. Unbeknownst to her, she happens to meet one hot sexy Navy SEAL who was willing to help her cross off her list. Cade Daniels was sent to Vegas by his best friend, Natalie Lewis to watch out her baby sister. His job was to watch over her but he soon found himself fulfilling Lucia's sexual fantasies. He knew if Lucia found out that he was sent by her older sister, Lucia's insecurities might resurface. So throughout his weekend affair with Lucia, he did not expect their sexual chemistry to be explosive. So what happens when Lucia learns of the truth of the real reason why she met Cade? To Tempt a SEAL by Sara Jane Stone was one hot sexy read. From the opening pages to the last page, this story was wickedly and sinfully addicting. There is nothing like reading a romance book of a hot Navy SEAL who can sweep you off your feet.

6168,"Read the book in '98 and liked it enough to keep it on the shelf to read again. Yesterday I saw the movie and felt there were too many unanswered questions and some important portrayals completely left out. It seems that the movie deals more with child abuse and the inability to feel. The boy was from an emotionless family and he was attracted to an emotionless older woman. Do not the psychology books tell us that we are attracted to the people who are most like our mothers and/or fathers who have impressed upon us for the majority our youth. My feeling about the book is we as a society in the present or in the past choose to overlook the morality of government whether it be Germany or the US. The government is there for control, to make people rich, to control our beliefs and keep us dependent on the government. They want to be mother and father and for us believe in them to make the right decisions. Then we do not have to take responsibility or think or make the decisions which requires time and energy. When people disagree with government decisions, they can easily be outcasts or called ""unAmerican"" as we saw happen 7 years ago. People who did not believe that the Iraqi war was morally right were labeled anti American. Have we forgotten that???? Many Rightwinged Republican have forgotten and the only excuses they seem to come up with are"" Bush was advised poorly and Hillary voted for the war""....not that Bush lied along with his leadership to have the war they had prepared for and yes, Hillary did vote for the war in fear that she would be labeled antiAmerican.

6180,"This is not like most ""whiteboards"" you usually see.  Instead it is a clear coating over some kind of white background paper or cardboard.  It still works fine with dry erase markers and from a distance you really cannot tell the difference, but up close you can and it looks a little strange.  Worse though, the clear coating plastic? cracks fairly easily and then the dry erase marker gets into the cracks and it is hard to wipe off.  Over time, I am guessing this will become a problem, so I am going to do my best not to let it crack any more.  Unfortunately, when I received it, it already had several small cracks in it  likely due to the shipping process as the cardboard box it shipped in had a few dents and cuts in it. I would probably have returned it, but the 2day shipping I have Prime somehow ended up taking 4 days and I needed to use it the day that it arrived so I did not have time to get it replaced.

Bottom line, as long as it does not get damaged in shipping and you can keep it from cracking, it is a good dry erase board for the money especially at this size, 4'x3', which cost around the same as most 3'x2' boards, but do not expect it to look like the standard ""whiteboard"".",A good dry erase board for the money,You get what you pay for

For the book, I liked how all of the elements from the original fairy tale were present. I liked that the Huntsman was a fractured hero. Not too saccharin.  I liked that Snow White was brave and determined. She was the only one with a vision of a better way of life and was willing to pursue it to her own death if needed to help her people.  But ultimately what was a cool idea for re telling a familiar story was executed without really engaging the heart of the story.  What is the point of the story of Snow White?  The point is that purity of heart, courage and selfsacrifice create a future of better lives and possibilities for those around us. Goodness wins and in winning creates a new world where the Queen's evil can no longer rule others or create their partial destruction. The themes of good and evil collide in the Huntsman and in the women who disfigure their own children to keep them from the Queen's need for fresh youth.  Another theme that could have been explored more thoroughly is old vs. young. Ravenna is old and treacherous, intent on keeping her power at all cost.  Snow White is young. Eric is young'ish.  William is young. The Duke is old too. He does not support change until Snow White says she will face the Queen no matter what.",Grapy and sinister,"Cool idea, needed better development"

6228,"I ordered my first can of Toppick Hair Building Fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users. I agree that this is a good product. It is not great, it does not make me suddenly look like I have lots of hair, but I must say that it is better than the hair I ""naturally"" have now. Apparently due to aging, my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years, and I have tried many, many products in an effort to either regrow hair, or to give the illusion of more hair. Toppick is applied after shampooing, drying and styling, and on top of any other hair thickening products. It is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can. Toppick is sold in several different color shades and ""Light Brown"" is the first shade that I tried, as I have light brown hair with blond highlights, neither of which are my natural shade. After the first few shakes, I discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders, shirt and the bathroom than on my head. I invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and I urge anyone who is interested in trying Toppick, to do the same. The nozzletip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product. The major plusses of Toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and I find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair. The minuses include: 1. I need to use a lot of Toppick to achieve the desired results, making this product more expensive than I thought it would be; 2. I need to use a special ""spray"" to get the fibers to stick in place, adding another",Best Hair Structured Fibers,"""Better than what I have now"""

6238,"Being a pretty big fan of Ted Dekker, and not having read any nonfiction by him, I was pretty intrigued by the premise of his newest book with Carl Medearis, Tea With Hezbollah Sitting At The Enemies' Table. ""Coauthor"" Carl Medearis is basically an expert on ChristianMuslim relations, having spent a good part of his life in extremely dangerous places attempting to love them. With his connections, Medearis was able to arrange a ""Middle East Tour"" where he and Dekker were able to sit down with prominent Muslim leaders, asking ""People Magazine""style questions in order to paint a more human picture of these people. In this respect, I would say they accomplished their goal. The interviews definitely show a side of these people you will not see in the news. There are no 1dimensional portrayals of Jihadist terrorists here. These ""enemies of the West"" are real people with families, fears, hopes, and stories. Dekker as he was really the author of the book provides extensive background on the people and places via Medearis in most cases, I am sure. In addition, some chapters are basically journallike entries with Dekker discussing his emotions and preconceived notions of the people he is about to meet. Finally, there is a very interesting story about a girl named Nicole that weaves its way through the book and the places they visit. Dekker's trademark narrative style shines here. Despite its success in showing a different side of these people, though, I was disappointed with the book overall. The differences between Christians and Muslims theologically are great, and this book will not do anything to shine any light on those differences or help people understand and discuss those differences. Some might want to complain that theology does not matter. It does. Dekker tries to state multiple",Ted Dekker's newest book is with Carl Medearis and,Was Hoping For More

6289,"Hard rock band Bush released their third album ""The Science of Things"" in 1999. This was the first Bush album that was actually a letdown for me personally, and it made me start to wonder how much was left in the tank for these guys.

Released at a time when bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Kid Rock were all rage in the rock world, Bush decided to push ahead with their brand of postgrunge styled hard rock. This album is not terrible by any means, but it certainly is not as good as the previous two records. The songwriting is decent enough throughout the album, and the production is done nicely, but sometimes the songs just blend together and get lost somewhere. Songs like ""Warm Machine,"" ""Jesus is Online,"" ""Letting the Cables Sleep"" and ""Chemical's between Us"" are highlights, but most of the rest are sort of average at best. This would be my third favorite Bush record overall.

I guess this record is must have for any fans of that old 90s altrock sound. To me, this is where Bush began to fall down the ladder, and soon afterwards they would be a band no longer.",A Little Stranger,3.5 stars for Bush's third album

Well, I did finish it although at times I was not sure I could.  This was due to sections of the plot which seemed to drag out unnecessarily.  My biggest struggle, which ultimately meant putting the book down for a few days, was the level of detail the reader experiences from the point of view of child abuser, Kent. I believe inferencing is a beautiful technique in writing, and I truly wish more of it had been utilized as the reader learned of not only Kent's past but the impact it had on him as an adult and ultimately his victims. I just feel it was too graphic, and I was very uncomfortable.  These points being made, I understand the more favorable reviews written about this book.

The iGaging EZ Cal digital caliper easily stands out in quality and accuracy when compared to the other 2 main contenders in the under $30 price category the Neiko and Carrera. Comparing them side by side it is no contest in terms of build quality and finish. You can tell they took extra steps in the polishing and finishing process which makes them look more sleek and professional. It is also obvious they they build these to much tighter tolerances than the Neiko and Carrera. There is not any ""slop"" or ""wiggle room"" between the measuring body and the ruling body which is why it scored the highest of all of the calipers for accuracy and repeatability.

6312,"Actual Rating 4.5 Stars Youthanasia1994. Megadeth's Sixth Studio Release. In 1994, Grunge, stricken with the death of Kurt Cobain, began to get less and less popular, and with the 1995 releases of Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' and Alice In Chain's selftitled album, that genre sadly went out of style and was replaced with RapMetalgod help us. Always in the shadow of things, bands like Megadeth and Metallica, who hit it big in the early90's, tried valiantly to repeat their sucess, and with the 1994 release of 'Youthanasia', Megadeth once again entered the Top 30. While Metallica's 'Load'which was released later the next year has since become a disgrace even if it did go to 1, Megadeth prospered until the release of 'Risk', which effectively saw them ""sellingout"" too. In retrospect, 'Youthanasia' has been described by fans as one of Megadeth's best, and certainly their last great album. So, is 'Youthanasia' a good listen, or a sorry state of affairs? Read on to find out! Track Ratings Reckoning Day 'Youthanasia' starts off with ""Reckoning Day"", an unforgiving, metallic attack that blends thunderous, pounding guitar riffs and demented vocals with the solos and choruses Megadeth fans have come to know and love. Train of Consequences One of Megadeth's strongest tracks, ""Train of Consequences"" starts off with the spitfireIt is undescribable, but amazing guitar riff, but Mustaine turns the song into an optomistic, melodic look at the possibilities of life. Mustaine's pained vocals and Friedman's wacky guitar work will blow you away! Addicted To Chaos A slow thrasher, ""Addicted To Chaos"" uses a pulsing guitar riff and melodic vocals from Mustaine to create a slow rocker not unlike their hit ""Almost Honest"". Friedman and Mustaine hit all the right notes, and Menza's drumming will not fail to please. Not really a ballad, yet one of",Metals,"Megadeth's Last ""Classic"" Album"

6323,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit...,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

6325,"As a youth I tried to watch every John Wayne western.  This is a fairly typical example of such a western.  The director is Howard Hawks.  John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are, of course, iconic.  This is a very early role of James Caan.  Mr. Hawks directed a previous western with John Wayne, ""Rio Bravo"".  To be honest about it, this movie is very similar.  However, I do like ""El Dorado"" better.

My very favorite John Wayne westerns come both earlier, ""The Searchers"", and the so called Calvary Triology,  And later in John Wayne's career, ""True Grit"", and ""The Shootist"".  But this movie is a pretty good middle career western for John Wayne.",A good middle career western,"A Good, Fairly Typical John Wayne Western"

6327,"A number of film critics have been rendered redfaced by this movie, practically forced into issuing revisionist statements to their reviews published at the time of the film's release.  Whether the change of heart is due to improved understanding of the text or to the pressures of popular canonization, this Holy Grail has proven one of the most commonly shared quests of followers separated by as much as 3 generations.  Film teachers are often disappointed to discover that young viewers no longer respond with interest let alone animation to Chaplin and Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields.  The reasons are often attributed to the desensiticizing effects of fastfood modern culture, or to the postmodern amnesia that insures satire can not possibly work with an audience unfamiliar with the original objects of satire.  All interesting, if not compelling, theoriesuntil you come to this film.  For a singular 90 minutes, the generations unite, erasing the boundaries of high and low culture, the informed and the uninformed, the old and the young.  There are not many such grails left.  Long may this one continue to reside in viewers' consciousness, inspiring us to our individual and collective pursuits.","A number of film critics have been rendered redfaced by this movie, practically forced into issuing revisionist statements...",A commonly shared culture (at last!)

He is specially a master in scenes of action on which he lays music with fresh movement, full of rhythm and harmonic insight, generally with the best orchestras and musicians in the place. 'Bullitt', 'Mannix', and 'Mission Impossible' are perfect examples of this.

Now that Mr. Schifrin created his own label Aleph Records, these important soundtracks have seen the light of day in CD format. Very good!

It does not seem as thrilling as Jon's solo album ""Psycho Jukebox,"" but that album also had some duds. It was a mix of good with some bad, while this album provides sounds from all three members of the band and it is all good!!! It is not as groundbreaking and great as Costello Music, but could any band top that again?

6335,"this is a good enough product to dampen drum heads or cymbals. I say that with my teeth biting my tongue a little. Let me say 1st of all that there is nothing quite so sad to an audience's ears than a poorly tuned batter head on a drum. Properly tuned drums just sing with a melodic voice that is true and pure. I would encourage any drummer experienced or novice to learn about tuning. In this age of digital media available like YOUTUBE and others , there is an easy outlet for lessons and proper technique to get ""your"" sound. I like to start in middle C, and go up or down from there. Now , there is a place for moon gels, and for me it is in the studio on my PAISTE Signature Ride cymbal to just take the edge off on a few songs that I had to record. I tune my snares as a rule very high in the Funk range, and I found that this keeps things dry and my stick work does not suffer. If I want to play a Rock type sound on that same drum on the next set , it is just a matter of detuning the lower 3 lug one full turn on the bottom and 1 1/2 turns on the left and right bottom.........or you can just use some moon gels to muddy it up a bit. I have found that experimentation is key to good tuning and therefore good playing, resulting in smiles on the faces you are playing to. I will not lie , I have used moon gels before and love the stuff. Very good and not just for percussion instruments. Bottom Line : Yes , I recommend this product and yes , I will",Great product to dampen drum heads and cymbals,Everything in its place

My only gripe about the case is the android guy not showing up as well as my wife's purple Nexus 7 case.

6347,"Like you, I do not have time to write reviews  but this product is such a disappointment I feel I must. I have used PC's for decades. Norton was once the only reliable protection  back in the DOS days. I dropped Norton 5 years ago because it would become a resource hog  and went to PCCillin  but it grew slower, so after 2 years I tried Norton again  finding it still a resource hog. After 1 year, I switched to Bitdefender  and found it much faster, but it slowed email too much even with email scanning turned off. When the subscription ran out, I read reviews saying the ""new"" Norton was now the most efficient, with competitive protection  and chose it for the coming year  just 6 weeks ago. It is turned out to be unuseable  unpredictable slowdowns even in ""Silent Mode"" with system lockups no blue screens, but same effect. I cannot wait a year this time. I will just have to writeoff the expense and find another. Truth is, I have no way to vet the reviewers  too many are ""planted"" by the manufacturers  or seduced by their advertising money.

6349,"It was so so long time ago that I saw this film that I really had a blur memory about this film.
I really am a huge fan of the director Jim Sheridan and already own his other movies like THE BOXERIN THE NAME OF THE FATHER. Both movies involved stories about IRA but this movie is totally different.
This is a sweet litttle movie and I was totally fallen in love with the charactor Christy Brown. I was absorbed into his charactor so deeply that I was him himself through out the movie and really enjoyed it.
The nurse whom he is going to be married him is really adorable and his mother too. Actually all of the charactor in this movie is really great and I do not even know how the director found those actors.
This is the sweetest film I have not seen for a long time.
Although it was pretty late at night that I saw this film, I had no problem seeing it till the end and smiled.

6366,"This system really was as simple to set up and get working as they say it is, and has been reliable for me so far. I had no problem at all viewing a camera at the other end of my house from the gateway through several walls, I did have to move my gateway at least a foot away from my wireless router though. I love that the motion detection is real motion detection works the same way an alarm system would detect motion via IR, most of the socalled detection schemes other netcams use are just an image motion detection algorithm that just is not reliable, and that will not work at all in low light. Being able to place the small cameras anywhere is really cool. It is great having the iphone app too, it works well. Being able to have video clips recorded offsite when motion is detected is great for security purposes. The only drawbacks are that the frame rate is slower than other netcams but that is not a real concern for me and the biggest issue for me is that I cannot use the system from my work location, they did a great job making the gateway able to work without needing to open any ports on the router, but for some strange reason made the viewing web page dependent on how your network is set up, which means I am unable to view the cameras most of the day, but to their credit, when I contacted their customer service about it, said they would consider trying to fix it.

It has a great range except I need to go purchase a wide angle  but has generally done well in meeting most needs and I love the telephoto ability. However most of my shots are just not very sharp. I would say it is all the lens except some of them ARE sharp. I finally decided that it just focuses a bit too slow or off in some cases  especially in telephoto action shots. I take a bunch of RAW burst mode but very few will actually work out. I have been able to take pretty decent photos at inside performances of the performers on stage but I have switched to manual focus. The lens also has unbelievable ""creep"". I ALWAYS put the lock on it when I carry it around otherwise the lens would be permanently at full telephoto.

Having a large background in Indian heritage i can always say i have had an obsession with forests, water, the earth, and a closeness to nature in general. This album is a brilliant masterpiece of haunting ambient beauty and basically steals your soul and does not give it back until the album is over. All the songs are very in depth with much emotion but each one being its own entity. Staring off with Avalon The Goddess of the Sacred Landscape you really get the feeling sully puts his heart into it, also with the really great female vocalist he uses, its clear to see why the song is so beautiful and effective. 7 Years being one of the strongest tracks on the record is really a great song in itself, clocking in at just under 9 minutes it has a very powerful and moving vibe to it. I will study more into what it means but i am pretty sure it is the death of someone close, he is dealt with for 7 years. Broken Road is a great song very reminiscent of Geoff Tates solo song ""Someone Else"" only without the annoying high range vocals. The song sends chills up your spine and is obviously very personal mentioning Sullies father. Great track. Sinner's Prayer is a great Indian vibed track complete with chants, and orchestra which most songs on here consist of.

First, you need to put whatever moisturizer that you use, then wet the bristles a little bit, ok..now you put this wonderful brush on your face turn it on and massage the cream into your skin! The vibrations are not so hard that it makes your face feel weird or give you a headache...they also are not so light that you cannot even feel them... they are just right!

After using this massaging brush against my face, with my moisturizer, my face felt soooooo smooth...omg... I immediately wanted my hubby to rub cheeks with me... I love it!

It comes with a charger and some replacement bristles...the bristles/brush are easy to clean...cream does not get off into them and a simple rinse off is all that is needed.

I recommend this gentle, massaging face brush!",Just right!,YES! Makes your face smooth
6397,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but need to include more rods in the kit,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
6398,"Marie Claire is a wonderful read, and well worth the money for the beauty tips alone! I have many issues that I keep just for reference.  Marie Claire has it all:  the best fashions on the runway, recommendations for all income levels and body types.  I love Vogue, but more for entertainment value, since I cannot afford the clothes advertised in it.  Marie Claire has something for every woman in every background and income level to enjoy.

Interviews, articles and reader input are also excellent.  This is not just a ""mirror, mirror"" magazine.  Articles explore social issues and current affairs along with the usual celebrity features.  I bought a twoyear subscription, and am already making plans to renew.

6402,"Provides a lot of features for a smaller size remote and since I have smaller hands, the remote fits perfectly. I like that it is rechargeable, no more searching for batteries, and that it can still be used while charging. However, it is slightly awkward to hold since the charging plug is on the side of the remote. I also like that all of the custom programmable buttons are located at the top of the remote for easy access. There is only one issue that I have with this remote, that it does not have a back return button. When traversing a directory hierarchy, in order to go up one level, I have to flip the remote over and hit the 'esc' button. I eventually programmed one of the custom buttons to work as the 'return' button for the tv and that does the job, but that also requires line of sight to the tv. For this reason I could not give 5 stars. Overall still a great remote.",Would love to have a larger remote!,I like that it is rechargeable

6408,"When in the 80's I saw Peter Graves use those little laser discs to find out about their new Mission:Impossible, I thought that was great new technology. A few years later audio CDs arrived in Portugal. When DVDs started to come out, I found out what a great picture quality compared to the old VHS tapes. And the possibility of watching a movie with English subtitles was a great way to learn English and to understand the picture much better than any language translation because there are expressions which just cannot be translated. Either you understand it or you do not.

Now with BluRay, the movie companies go to every effort to force the consumer to buy the same movies again, after have bought them on VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition. They make new special features, new cover designs, new commentaries, new everything but they forget Europe is in a economic crisis and even if we are SOOOOOO tempted to buy our favorite movies with the BEST picture and sound quality available, we just CANNOT! Us the portuguese have no money and no way to get it. The Wizard of Of of course is one of those classics, as well as Willy Wonka, Annie, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, the Bond movies, etc etc etc. The list is endless.

And even if we could buy it, somewhere in the future a new medium will be invented probably a microchip with 2K or 4K resolution of those movies. I think we have to draw the line somewhere, people. Come on. Be serious. The minimum wage here is 480 Euros. A BluRay costs between 10 and 40 Euros.

6415,"We bought this because we needed to figure out a way to let our older mellower cat to wander in and out of our bedroom at night while keeping the younger, more boisterous and sleepdisrupting cat out. Our handyman installed it for us and it installed just fine on our hollow core bedroom door and it only took him about 20 minutes to install it. Unfortunately, once it was installed, it was far too sensitive to work most of the time creating a frustrating situation for our kitty and us. This is the reason this item garners four stars instead of five. Upon calling the manufacturer, they knew exactly what the problem was and shipped us out a new solenoid that arrived a few days later and solved the problem. But quality control at the point of manufacture should have caught this before we ever bought it and installed it. We have now had the new solenoid for a couple of months and our older kitty comes and goes as he pleases and we are all happy with the door.

My complaint is that I had to buy a new system in order to get this game.  I mean I could make the choice not to buy, but then again I could not could I because I love Resident Evil.

6428,"God, I hope I never posted my older review of this album on here amazon.com or anything. It sucks! See, here is how it goes. I write a few sentences ontopic, then I am off yelling at the general critical establishment for overrating it, then I abruptly switch to talking about Columbian drug lords. Next thing you know, I am on a completely new tangent about how bad Foreigner is. I am only spending half the time talking about the music, too. Such a travesty will not occur during this review, though. I do think that, while it is definitely the Clash's secondbest album, and while it is packed with important hits, and that there is only one bad song on it ""The Card Cheat"", which is totally overblown, that it is a bit overrated. I mean, I have seen so much praise for it, and I do not quite agree with it. But it is good! Really, really good! The reggae stuff is especially fantastic: ""Wrong them Boyo"" is a bouncy good time; ""The Guns of Brixton"" is a druggy, ominous protest; ""Revolution Rock"" has an exceptional horn part; and ""Rudie Cannot Fail"" is probably the most fun you will have on this album. Reggae even creeps into the title track's timebomb syncopation. But there is more than just reggae. This is one diverse album, you see! There' s jazz ""Jimmy Jazz"". There is rock title track ; ""Clampdown"", my favorite besides ""Guns of Brixton""; ""Spanish Bombs"", ""Death or Glory""; ""Four Horsemen""; ""I am Not Down"". There is disco ""Lost in the Supermarket"", yet another in a long line of fantastic songs. There is pure pop ""Train in Vain Stand By Me"", a deserved breakthrough single.

The tool could not be easier to use and makes strong as heck joints. My only regret is that I did not upgrade and get the master system right away.  If you are a woodworker and/or repairing furniture you cannot go wrong with this. I would recommend getting a large jawed clamplike the one that comes with the master system and an assortment of pocket hole screws; you can never have too many.

My problem with heror her marketing teamis that she appears to strive for higher literary goals. And I do not feel she achieves them.
However, this book recounts an interesting story. In the early years of the depression, a young bride learns about life and love in a big old home in New Hampshire. A secondary character, a young Boston socialite, matures through her interactions with this New Hampshire community. In the background, fierce and bloody union wars rage: an intriguing glimpse into the social fabric of the region at that time.

She was manipulated by her mother who was incensed that her daughter had not found a husband after three unsuccessful seasons. Now Thea is happily exiled to Ireland where she is enjoying time with her aunt and trying to gain access to a neighboring dukes attic for his paintings.

Never wanting to return to Ireland, he dismisses letters from a neighbor who wants access to some paintings of his fathers. When she comes to London, he assumes she is looking for a husband and after one dance he unwittingly makes her the bell of the ball, instead, she is angry and demands to be taken back to Ireland before her mother does something stupid like marry her off. And the antics begin. What a fun, entertaining book. I was hooked from the beginning, the letters Thea and Dalton exchange before they meet are hilarious and I could not wait to get these two together. Thea was intriguing from the beginning. I wanted to meet the woman whose mother tried to trick a duke into marrying her. Thea was always shy and often did not fit in with London",Then it's a shame to know that the Duke of Ogborne has been looking for his father after three unsuccessful seasons,Wonderful historical romance

I used Hario Skerton mill to grind these beans and carried out Hario Skerton's coffee brewing instructions for French press method 10 grams of beans for 100 ml of water I used Voss and Evian bottled water, Aquasana and  AquaPure filtered water; so far, I prepared this coffee 12 times; I varied the grind size 3 times and brewed it for 4 and 5 minutes, hoping I would find a grind size/water/brewing  time combination that would identify the best resulting cup of coffee characteristic of a Sidamo coffee but... not much difference: the unusual acrid vinegar like smell persists; not even faint chocolate like aroma; not  rich at all weak body; no hint of sweetness; no complex flavor; quite acidic; no floral aroma; finish is dull and unimpressive...

Fortunately, most Squirrels in our neighborhood are not that smart.

In theory, burning DVDs should be relatively easy, after all, the DVD is pretty standard these days, and BY DEFINITION, Apple uses standardized hardware I am not starting a flame war, but suffice it to say that there are pros standardization and cons the Apple Tax to that practice, so Roxio does not need to make their software compliant with every single DVD burner out there, just those that come in Apple machines. In theory at least. Installation completed without a hitch, and upon launching the program, it looked as though the software was going to perform as advertized. Except that every single time I started a DVD burning project it would hang. It did not matter what media I used I tried several different disk or what I was burning I tried doing just one 2 minute file to see if that would complete the burn would fail midway through. A product that fails this miserably at one of it is primary features is hardly worth my time. I do not want to spend hours troubleshooting software that clearly has major bugs. If I were the only one with this issue, I might consider that the problem is with my machine and not the software, but my 12 years of computer experience including a professional level of aptitude at both hardware repair and software and OS troubleshooting tells me that it is this software and not my computer.

6620,"A high speed, incredibly technical shot in the arm to the current pop punk and emo scene.  After a brief listen, many people might simply come to the conclusion that Rufio is simply another New Found Glory, but anyone who really gives Rufio a chance will be in for a great surprise.  Sure, the two bands share a great deal of vocal similarities, but that is about where it ends.  Rufios sound springs forth at a nearly unprecedented speed, with guitar riffing so wickedly technical, it almost borders on metal, yet they never lose their melodic style.  To top that off, this album is not a broken hearted sob fest over the singers lost love, there is some truly deep and serious subject matter touched upon on this disc, and it is all handled in a mature manner.  Stop Whining deals with someone who is contemplating suicide, and the song Save The World offers a very strong and intelligent opinion on those who really push the envelope on organized religion.  Of course you will have your lovesick anthems like One Slowdance and the most truly emo track on the album, Tears.  The album concludes with The Wrath, an all out instrumental metal fest, where lead guitarist, Clark, has a chance to show his speed and ability.  This is one of those bands who truly do deserve the success that I Am sure this album will bring them.  8/10

Any viewer will spot the numerous references filmmaker Siodmak makes to the modernist movement, from the huge number of technological inventions, to the attitude of the characters, even to the assertion of the primacy of the artist. It seems there are two sorts of artist, one is the decent kind embodied by Alan Curtis' character ""Scott,"" an engineer interested in helping the poor.

Light is made well and is plenty bright and attaches easily to the roll bar with 2 zip ties provided. Might be a good idea to put a small piece of 2 side Velcro between the light and mounting surface to totally secure light from spinning but  probably not necessary for everyone. Mine holds pretty good but if you apply a little too much pressure to the button to turn it on or off could cause the light to move a little off center.

6638,"This ceiling projector mount is pretty good for the price. There really is not the need to spend more money on other brands. But although I was looking for a wall mount for my projector, I grabbed this one since I figured I can adopt it for my application. With only minimal alteration of the original product, I managed to hang it on the wall. This is how I rigged it.

I drilled two holes into the removable section of the narrower extension arm. The holes were drilled at the furthest end from the wall bracket, each hole on either side of the already predrilled hole in this removable section. The holes were spaced so the bolts from the hardware that normally attaches into this narrower arm at the normal end when mounted from the ceiling would fit and then were tightened from within the interior of the narrower arm. But before I could attach the hardware together, I had to disassemble another piece of the assembly by temporarily removing two removable rivets with needlenose pliers so I could insert the aforementioned hardware into this second part and then reassemble the rivets with the smaller part inside the larger one. Next I lined up the bolts into the three holes one predrilled in the factory and the other two I drilled myself and tightened them. I managed to get the thing to work with very minimal modification, and I am a bit surprised the manufacturer could not have provided this or a similar solution when manufacturing this mount. Regardless, I have posted a couple of photos of my contraption to aid in visualizing how my modification ended up.","If you want the same thing, I'd find this as expected",Great Product for Great Price.

There is a lot of money grab in the game microtransactions, but they are all optional. you do not need to buy anything to beat the game.

My only complaint on the game is some of the cars that were in prior versions of the game are now DLC, but honestly, with so many cars you do not need to buy DLC stuff.

6672,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit.,good kit with some caveats

Once established, the flow is more than adequate for lifting the gravel partway up the rigid tube, separating the accumulated waste and detritus from the gravel, and returning the gravel to the bottom of the tank.  The waste is sucked up through the rigid piece, into the flexible tubing, and out into whatever receptacle you use to collect your waste water.  There is a screen at the top of the rigid tube that prevent fish, gravel, or other large items from getting sucked into the flexible tubing and clogging it.

I was immediately interested in trying out the Earforce Z22 as it seems similar to my PX21 set but geared specifically toward PC gaming. And having just dropped a bundle on the Steam Summer Sale I was in the market for a dedicated PCgaming headset. SETUP: This is really very easy. The Z22's come packed nicely and getting setup on my PC was literally just a minute or two. The headset features prominently an inline amplifier the box with the volume, bass, treble, chat adjustments which is powered through the USB. The other attached cable is a standard 3.5mm audio jack that plugs into your computer. The headset also detaches from the amplifier another 3.5mm jack and allows you to plug the Z22 into other devices like a smartphone/tablet/mp3 player. This way you can listen to audio on your device of choice without the amp. DESIGN QUALITY: The design of the Z22 headset is really quite nice as is the overall headset quality in both construction and sound. I immediately noticed that this headset felt quite a bit more rugged and heavier than my PX21 set. The first game I played with this headset was Metro: Last Light and the audio quality is very, very good. This is not a surround sound set so if you have had the fortune of using one of those headsets the Z22 may leave you wanting more. But for a stereo headset gamer you cannot go wrong with the Z22.

I enjoy her alpha males and I have to admit I like the drama of her ""horrible misunderstandings"" that are generally at the crux of the hero's and heroine's problems. I find all of the books to be a lot of fun and I love a happily ever after. I totally recommend the Hometown Hero series. Go for it!",Best Hometown Hero series,Hometown Hero Series

6697,"The time, world war 1.  The place, the French Army on the Western Front.  A French infantry regiment is ordered into an impossible attack against a powerfully fortified position.  They fail, of course, in some of the most realistic combat scenes of any movie.  The combat scenes are essentially ""Saving Private Ryan"" without the gore. Of course, this impossible mission was motivated by corrupt French politics and the venal ambition of the French division commander, and now three soldiers are to be scapegoated for ""cowardice"" and tried by courtmartial.
Kirk Douglas plays the role of the commander of the attack who also acts as defense counsel for the scapegoated soldiers, whom he knows to be innocent.  This was a great role for Douglas.  The acting in this flick is very good, the story line is excellent, and the movie moves along at a brisk pace to its predictable but nonetheless hardhitting conclusion.
This movie will make you think, and helps one understand how an army full of tough soldiers can nevertheless be corrupted by politics and ambition, as the French army and nation indeed were.","Great & Hardhitting movie, and helps one understand how an army full of tough soldiers can nonetheless be corrupted by politics",A brilliant portrayal of a corrupt army and nation.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

6711,"For once I did not purchase this from Amazon but from that club belonging to Sam and it was 10 bucks cheaper there. It is not heavy or big at all so you will have no trouble fitting it in the back seat of your car or trunk as long as you have the room.

Its made from very durable plastic and is very easy to put together. All you need is a Phillip screwdriver for the included 4 screws. Everything else is snap in and go. Assembly takes approximately 15 minutes and your kids will be having fun pretending to grill in no time.

The burner knobs are clickable and the only part on the grill that makes any sound. The tap at the sink does not move but no worries. The oven is kind of small though and although it can be used for storage I would recommend getting a basket and storing the play food in there.

This comes with 4 plates, ketchup, mustard and food to make 2 burgers and 1 hotdog. Also comes with grilling tools.

This states from children age 3 years and up but my 15 month old enjoys playing with this as there is no small parts unless you count the ketchup, mustard and relish for the hotdog which are not very small.

I have posted pictures showing the grill with my 15 month old and the box details.",This is a good product for small kids!,Great for pretending and very durable
6712,"I saw these in a bicycle shop and hesitated because of the price, but did buy them anyway.  Wow!  They just feel great in your hands.  If your hands/fingers start to go numb when riding, it is likely because of the pressure on your hands, or because you squeeze your grips too tight.  These will help both those issues, because they transfer pressure from your fingers to the heel end of your palm, and also because they provide such a feeling of control, that you tend to relax your grip without even thinking about it.  There are similar shaped grips for much less, but these have three key features that make ALL the difference... 1. The ""paddle"" part of the grip is very wide for real support. 2. The ""paddle"" is rigid, not just soft, floppy rubber like on cheap ones.  3. These grips secure to be bars with a clamp/bolt, so once you have them positioned the way you want, they will not rotate, or slip out of place at all, without having to resort to adhesive, etc. super easy to take off when needed too.",Great grips for a great price,The right grips make just as much difference as the right seat.

6741,"After listening to this CD, I plan on purchasing all of Pink's previous works. This is a woman with raw talent and an amazing ability to compile a whole CD where every song is a hit. Now as you read this review, consider that I am a superconservative Republican who supports George W. Bush and his administration, and that I am not judging this CD by the political slam against the president on track 5. The greatest thing about this country is that we can state our political opinions through any medium we choose. I do not care if Pink is a communist, which I am sure she is not, she is a star, a musical genius, and has that scratchy, strong, and yet somehow soft voice that really causes an addiction. Let us look at the tracks onebyone: 1. Stupid Girls Here is a song that says a lot about society. I know she is just having fun on this song, but I think she is on to something. The lyrics are funny and of course, as I have mentioned earlier about Pink's work, very addictive. I do not think this is the best song on the CD, but it is a good start. 2. Who Knew By far the coolest song on the CD. Pink really delivers a song that describes the heartache and pain that comes from young and faulting love. The beat is catchy, the lyrics so lifelike that almost every human being on the planet should be able to relate to this heartbreak story in a song. The CD is worth the cost just for this song. Pink is indeed a musical force that requires attention and recognition! 3. Long Way To Happy Deep lyrics with Pink showing her musical range by stretching her voice",Love it,Amazing Talent and Creativity on this CD!

It is on a quest started by a novice writer the author which goes to the american national memory championship to make an article about it. An observer which is a master in memory tells him that he can easily participate in this contest if he just practices.

As a test Joshua begins to practice the capability of using his memory. He learns the tricks of the mind and deliberate practice technics to enhance them.

As the plots goes on, the writer examines the history of the mind. Going from ancient Greece to the middle ages up to today. He examines how we use our memory, how it evolved through history and how we can use it in the future.
By examining the worlds best memory capabilities to the person with the least, he manages to see why and how we can use our brains. The book shows a lot of tricks some can do to have a better memory. It also examines how to practice to achieve it.

The book had a lot of resembles to topics in other books, like the ""The Invisible Gorilla"", ""Talent is overrated"" and ""The power of the habit"" from the memory perspective, all written in a very fascinating manner.

I found My Burberry to be a very strong perfume that lasts a LONG time. Hours and hours later I can still smell it on my skin. Very floral, it is a wonderful spring/summer time perfume.

What I like best about TrendMicro is that is stays out of the way does not take up too many resources and it installs and uninstalls easily.

I wrestled with Norton and vowed to never, ever use them again. It simply took over my PC and it took forever to scrub it off my system; not so with TrendMicro; it runs very cleanly.

It is nothing that a slight adjustment of the bass and treble controls cannot fix. You may like a brighter sound and find that the direct audio feature stays on 100 of the time. There is enough tonal flexibility to satisfy most listeners. Frankly this unit sounds MUCH better than it is price would indicate. The AM/FM tuner is okay but I am going to guess that you are considering the TX8050 because it can stream internet radio. It are not sophisticated but it will work quite good provided your WiFi is up to the task. Do not expect miracles from a $250 product. Onkyo's website explains exactly what this unit can do, so I would suggest a visit there to avoid any disappointments. The Onkyo dongle is not all that great so I would actually recommend that you hardwire the streaming content via an Ethernet cable. The coolest thing about the receiver is the preamp section. You have a built in Texas Instruments D/A converter that is probably better than the converter in your bluray player.

6793,"I have noticed something about Alfred Hitchcock thrillers.  They really are not that thrilling.  But they do have genuine class.

I will not summarize the plot of this one.  I will say though that the pacing is leisurely, the story interesting, the performances all strong.  I particularly liked Martin Landau.  And James Mason has a voice that makes everything he say sound like Shakespeare.

But who I really love is Cary Grant.  Man, that guy was one cool cat.  Even when he is being hunted by spies, he is still relaxed and continental and witty.  I would have given the movie 4 stars but Landau, Mason, and Grant push it easily into five.

If you do not need a car chase or gun fight every five minutes then this is a very good movie.  It does not always make sense.  I mean, who would use a cropdustermounted machine gun to kill a guy when you could just drive by and shoot him?  But who cares.  It is got style, class, and some very witty dialogue.

But more importantly, it is got Cary Grant.  He is so cool.",Not that thrilling. But they have genuine class,A snapshot of a different filmmaking era

Overall this is a great compromise for those that need this sort of software but keep in mind that you are limited in feature set .

6802,"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 rightangles before going through the floor into the flexible dryervent hose coming from the dryer. I cannot get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up. Then I pulled it all out and there was not any lint at all that came out. So now I am resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Set in rural Mississippi much of the book revolves around the unlikely friendship between a young white boy, Larry Ott who comes from a working class family, and an African American boy, Silas, or '32' as he is later referred to, being raised by his single Mother. Silas and Larry are now grown men, and Silas has returned to the town he had left long ago to a be a constable. Quickly, Larry and Silas's lives reconnect following a horrible act of violence that lands Larry in the hospital fighting for his life. But also at play is the mystery surrounding Larry as he is the primary suspect in the disappearance of a girl form the town, which only seems more suspect since as a young man he went out one night with a pretty popular girl from school who never returned home.  Franklin has written not only a wonderful character piece, but a terrific mystery as well, that feels vaguely reminiscent of Dennis Lehane.",Good read,Solid on So Many Levels

6889,"Sometimes my first impression listening to a release of this magnitude turns out to be deadon and then sometimes repeated play exposes weaknesses I was quick to overlook in my zeal to embrace new music by one of my favorite artists. For that reason, many times I have to listen to an album especially those with more progressive leanings for a few weeks or even months sometimes in order to really appreciate the greatness. I confess that my initial impression a few weeks back was like so many others, Wow, this is the Queensryche we have been missing. But then a bit of skepticism began to creep in with repeated listens and I noticed the music seemed to lack some of the passion and motivation Id been hearing initially. It was definitely much better than the selftitled reboot but it was not moving me as much as it had on initial listens and I began to wonder if I would be reaching for this music 6 months down the road. After putting it away for a week and listening to some other new and old material and then coming back with a fresh perspective I Am ready to nail down my impressions all of which are thankfully circling back to that all important initial impression. The Warning/Rage For Order both perfect are my two favorite Queensryche releases but I love OM, Empire and even Promised Land in descending order. My expectation for this new incarnation of Qryche was that I honestly never wanted to hear another Operation Mindcrime nor did I expect a return to those early career moments of brilliance. 2013s release was a good restart, but it left me wanting something more. It relied a bit too heavily on old formulas and the mix left a lot to",Better than the self-titled reboot,Yep ...This One Gets Better With Repeated Play

6894,"Where do I begin? Highlander is one of my alltime favorite movies. It combined fantasy, action, suspense, love, and dramatic settings with really cool special effects for the time period it was made. Christopher Lambert is witty and funny as the immortal Highlander, Connor MacLeod. Sean Connery was superb as MacLeod's mentor Juan Ramirez. Clancy Brown was an awesome super villain as the Kurgan I honestly do not believe there is been a villain as evil as the Kurgan  hey, even Darth Vader was good once!.

The flashbacks are terrific time capsules of Connor MacLeod's life. From his bonny Heather to the humorous encounter with a noble on Boston Common resulting in a duel to the death for calling his wife a ""bloated warthog"", MacLeod seemed to have been everywhere and done everything. The epic battle between MacLeod and the Kurgan for the prize are not only exciting, but filled with suspense.

My only regret was the movie was originally designed as a stand alone movie and allowed no room for sequels. The prize is won at the end. That is it. The gathering is over.

Since then, the producers of the show made two terrible attempts at cashing in with sequels which led to the embarrassing Highlander 2 and the ripoff Highlander 3.

They made a great TV series, but had to say, ""This is a different universe then the movies"" which completely ignores the sequels and makes vague references to Connor's encounter with the Kurgan.

Still, even with no opportunity to continue the story or delve deeper into the history of the immortals which is what made Highlander:The Series so good, this was a superb movie that is a must own for any fan of science fiction, fantasy, or action.","Fantastic Cute, witty and funny",A True 80's Classic
6895,"It really does the job! I am a woman with thinning hair.  I use the medium brown and it stays in until I shampoo my hair.  It does not rub off on my pillows and the .87 oz can last a surprisingly long time.  I highly recommend this product, it is so much better than the other things that I tried.  The Joan Rivers product was the worst.  It rubbed off on my pillows and the headrest in my car.",Is a woman with,I love it!
6896,"I have not spent nearly enough time with this to give it a thorough review. But it only took me five minutes to figure out it could not do one simple thing that QB for windows has had since at least 2004. Call it Progressive billing or partial invoicing, whatever you call it is a ridiculously simple transaction that is practiced in every trade and profession, and in some is the prime transaction. Simply put, you can create an invoice from a sales order or estimate, etc. In windows you can invoice for part of the sales order or combine multiple sales orders onto one invoice. In the mac version, NADA. One more time. You cannot bill someone for part of an PO. It is all or nothing. When I was looking around the support forums on intuit's site, I came across a posting about someone complaining that intuit left this feature out of the QB 2010 for Mac. An intuit Product manager chimed in that ""it was not left out, we chose not to include it because we do not think our customers require this feature. but if its important to you you should send in a feature request."" Nice. What is incredible is that we are not talking about some hugely complex function and ultimately it boils down to QB 2011 for the MAC is going to be of very limited use to a very small number of businesses. Oh by the way, 2011 still does not support creating an accountant copy, so good luck with that too. Intuit has got to be the worst/last company that still makes crippled versions of its products for macs. Honestly I do not know why they even bother. Its less work to use boot camp or parallels than try to workaround",What's indistinguishable is that we are not talking about some hugely complex function and ultimately it boil...,WHY DOES INTUIT BOTHER? its like it's 1992

6904,"As I have purchased several components which are used together, I am reviewing them as a group and repeating the review across all. My time with the product is still very short, I can only provide my initial impressions. RAM products are ASTOUNDING! They do tend to be a bit on the higher end of the spectrum for this type of product; however, the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" definitely holds in this case. The things I love about this group of products:

1  Once the devices are in place and tightened down, they are stable. There is minimal vibration; and, it does not swivel around when putting the phone in the cradle.
2  The X configuration of the cradle grip allows for maximum air flow around the phone. My previous phone suffered overheating damage from being in a cradle in the sun for an extended trip. The RAM components not only allow for more air flow but the long arm brings the unit further into the car, just past the rearview mirror, minimizing the amount of direct sun exposure during the hottest times of the day.
3  This is the EASIEST cradle I have owned for getting the phone in and out. I have the LG G3 currently.

I currently own two sets of this product. One for each vehicle. The LG G3 with a case is a bit of a tight fit in the phone grip cradle. It is not horrible; but, I have to put it in on an angle then straighten it. I have purchased the larger grip version for the second. It is much easier to get the phone in and out. I have not yet seen a down side to the larger vs normal. I will keep you posted......",A little more work with all RAM products,RAM is awesome
6905,"Titanium Maximum Security is another great addition by TM and this set protects not 1, not 2, but THREE computers!!

6915,"As they review `killstripes on gunbarrels"", middleaged men yours truly included lament, ""If I only knew then what I know now!"" Oh yes, it would have been a different story bang, bang, bang kapow! Seduction has little to do with physical appearance unless alcohol is involved empathy, I so assert, is more important. Get a woman to giggle and you are standing on second base. Paradise beckons. What about `Liszt for Lovers'? Should it too feature in such a retrospective: ""God dammit if only I had played that Widmung transcription on the night I took Lola HotLips and Vadge Galore up to Blueberry Hill!""? Seeking empiricism, I got a mate to trial it. He is a divorcee two years ago, his wife a fine lady in her own right became a sapphist and hit Carpet Beach. I worded him up. Anyway, he drove into town with this disc playing from the soundsystem of his Mercedes SL350 softtop. At a set of lights, halfway through Waldesrauschen, he was mauled by a pride of ubercougars whose notion of love differed from his own. From what he told me later, the dulcet tones of Claudio Arrau were drowned out by snarls and ululations of indeterminate pitch; yes indeed, the ubercougars fed to their hearts' content and then some more. Once they had slaked their carnal instincts, they took off into the night in their motorised trolleys. Depleted of zinc and somewhat dehydrated, my friend drove to the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken where a zinger burger restored his mojo and faith in humanity. Even so, I can still see the horror in his eyes. Nowadays he is a Cistercian and talks not. If you are looking for love in all the wrong places gulp this Liszt for Lovers is the musical equivalent of Fifty",Liszt for Lovers',A Salutary Tale
6916,"Jack Mckinley has less than one year to live. But there is a cure if he can find loculi, magic relics from Atlantis. Jack is not the only one. There are three other kids in the same institution. Because of their heritage, they need to have these seven artifacts together to survive.

At first they all are dubious and try to escape several time. But then they get serious about their training to get the artifacts. But they have to be quick, they are not the only ones after that artifacts.

I really liked this series. It is geared to younger boys, but it is still a good read. I liked the idea but will admit that I was wondering when it would involve the seven wonders of the world like you are lead to believe. The first part of the book was a bit tedious with them getting sick, showing up at the institution, escaping, returning, escaping, etc.

Beyond that, it is a good read. Similar to Percy Jackson with the gods, but with it is own twist. I will definitely be looking for the rest of the books in this series.

6924,"Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks Turbotax. But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions. Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook mostly by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version. 1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions. 2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning buggy as detailed by other reviewers too, not a better product. The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on ""Accept all"" 2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program. 4. Online support to download transactions is also limiteTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank. 5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes",Intuit is a despicable company now,Any Alternatives to This Buggy Software with No Technical Support?
6925,"If you need a full coverage foundation and you do not have very many facial wrinkles, then this Cover Creme by Dermablend may work well for you. It is definitely a thick makeup which will help to cover any pigmentation problems. However, because it is a very thick cream almost as heavy as the average concealer, if you have the normal lines and wrinkles on your face that are a result of aging, then this foundation may catch in those lines and not give you a smooth finish. One of the important things is to blot your skin after the makeup is applied. The directions also call for a ""setting"" powder, however, that may also just increase the ""caking"" effect in the lines of your skin. Personally, I did achieve a good, matte finish with this makeup and did not feel the need for a setting powder. One thing to note, this color was a bit darker and a bit more orange than I expected. If you normally have fair skin, this color may work for you if you have a facial tan.",Great Cream,Definitely Full Coverage Makeup

Nothing is more impressive than screaming out 9 songs straight and then ending on a beautifully written and sung ""Some Will Seek Forgiveness, Others Escape"". Actually they also top off that song with some good screaming in the end. This cd is marvelous in more than one way. If you think they have sold out, I think you are wrong, I think Underoath has found an amazing sound.

When I saw the picture at the movies it made me think of the book HEAT, the autobiography  of pro pitcher Dwight  Gooden.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and HEAT revolve  around thoughts of family and career as the man on the mound, considered  washed up by some, finds himself in what could be a nohit game.

Gooden  had his dying father on his mind as he was getting the ball past the bats  on that day in 1996.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's Billy Chapel, played well by  Kevin Costner, had thoughts of his late parents.  But unfortunately, the  film puts too much emphasis on Chapel's girlfriend, who may be ending their  relationship.  Are not girlfriend stories for teenage boys, not 30something  adult men?  Each time FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's baseball sequences start to  engross you, it cuts to flashbacks about the woman the pitcher has loved so  much through the years that, uh, he never married her?

See FOR LOVE OF  THE GAME on free or cable TV, where Costner, supporting actor John C.  Reilly and the exciting baseball sequences the director is Sam Raimi of  EVIL DEAD fame make it worth a look.",A great baseball pitcher,"Love of the game, or the girl?"

Acrobat is for power users who need tons and tons of complex features for ""power users"" as another reviewer put it. Corel PDF Fusion, on the other hand, is streamlined to serve one major purpose beyond a simple PDF viewer: it is good at printing high quality PDF files from other programs e.g. Word. Other than the simplified list of features, the two major advantages of Corel over Acrobat are 1 less clutter on your hard drive in terms of megabytes of the installed program files and 2 cost.

6985,"October 24,2008 Back in 1956 as a young boy indicated by the New York City school system as having unusual intuitiveness for playing instruments and having an ""ear"". The only media we had in our apartment in Upper Manhattan on the West Side was a severely cracked but operable Zenith Am radio. In the many hours of listening to that archaic purveyor of listening pleasure,I was an irrefutable Chuck Berry fan. Although Chuck Berry is still performing the songs on this disc, Maybelline, Roll Over Beethoven,Johnny B. Goode, I knew then in the middle 1950's as played on WMCA, The Good Guys in that tiny room in the yet to be gentrified Upper West Side that this is a man who is not coming around again for centuries if ever. I remember how he used to shuffle across the stage while hitting his electric guitar. I saw a documentary once on the Philco TV my father brought home on our happiest day as kids where they depicted Chuck Berry as a simple man from St Louis who travelled alone from airport to airport with his luggage immaculately lashed to his back. The Stones, Beatles and many British Invasion groups often speak of his incredible and forceful influence on their own songwriting. Johnny Rivers. for me the finest Chuck Berry cover artist ever, actually roamed the Brill Building promoting his talents when Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond and Wall of Sound producer Phil Spector spent their time writing the best music in a mystical place near the Flatiron building we remember, Tin Pan Alley.

I have mocha colored skin and rule of thumb is that you are suppose to choose at least one or two shades lighter when purchasing a concealer.  This way you can neutralize dark areas without having unwanted attention because it is way too light.  I am using the Medium Neutral Cool.

Concealers are for spot correctors and not to be used as an all over foundation substitute.  It should always be worn underneath foundation and powers. You can apply it with your finger or use a small brush.

The them michelle brand feels very velvety smooth and dries up to a satin powdery finish.  However, I found that it only looked smooth under my eyes, while areas where there are wrinkles and fine lines it looked caked on and very noticeable.  My dark circles did appear quick a bit lighter and my skin even looked smoother under my eyes.  However areas that I did spot covering for blemishes and acne dark spots did not look as smooth.  It looked obvious I used makeup to hide blemishes on my face.

7016,"This was Metallica's smash album, although they alienated some long time fans by toning their sound down to the mainstream quite significantly.  Although they still manage to maintain an edge overall, the thrash sound is largely gone.  It is clear that many of these songs were written to be radio accessible, which seemed a shame that Metallica sort of abandoned their craft.

The mainstream public ate this release up though and there was a new rash of Metallica fans all of a sudden.  Truth be told, ""Enter Sandman,"" ""Sad But True,"" ""Unforgiven,"" and ""Wherever I May Roam"" may be more enjoyable than anything on ""And Justice for All,"" despite its much better overall sound.  Still, I feel that the rest of the material here demonstrates Metallica taking a step in the wrong direction, though.

I do recommend this album to fans of the band, since this is their biggest seller, but longtime fans who loved Metallica's variety of trash metal may be disappointed.  While this is too complex an album to be labeled ""sellout,"" there seems some truth to that label, as the black album represents style triumphing over substance and gives the feeling that ""you too can now be a Metallica fan.""",A bit more enjoyable than the original,Good But There Are Better Metallica Choices

Ark is a relatively unknown German progressive rock band which formed in the late 90s comprised of vocalist Jorn Lande from The Snakes, guitarist Tore Otsby from Conception, and drummer John Maculuso from Yngwie Malmsteen. While the first album showed promise, it was not until the second album where Ark would truly shine as a unique band. Joining in on this release is bassist Randy Coven, and keyboardist Mats Olausson. First of all, if you have never heard of Ark, I am not the least bit surprised. I had to really search long and hard to discover this band. I only found this stellar album on accident after going from prog band to prog band and searching through hundreds of reviews. And man, I am so glad I found them. Ark is easily one of the best modern prog metal bands to come along in a while, and certainly one of the best rock albums of the new millenium. As other reviewers have pointed out, Ark is not an easy band to describe. They are very progressive, but in a more subtle manner, so they never try to show off or anything like that. If you listen hard enough, Ark displays LOTS of different influences from music of other cultures. At the same time that they are progressive, Ark also writes VERY CATCHY hardrock music. Many of the songs will stick in your head, but there is enough ""substance"" in the music to keep it fresh everytime you come back to it. Like others have mentioned, Ark is a nice change of pace from all the Dream Theater clone bands that are around. Their general sound is sort of an 80s classic rock/prog rock hybrid that transcends to other musical plateaus from song",Ark's second studio album,How can a modern rock band this good not be recognized???

7023,"Bridge Nylon! You do not need to worry about moisture like you do with regular nylon, right! Oh, so wrong... Once you figure out how to use this stuff properly, it works okay. But, boy, did it ever take me a long time to get it to work right. This stuff is the best desiccant I have ever seen. I can put it in a plastic bag with used desiccant packets, and I will get dry desiccant packets and wet filament. Unfortunately, once it is wet, it is thoroughly useless to print with because of how much water it holds. It comes out as a foam. However, I seem to have a system that works now. 1. Place Bridge Nylon in plastic bag with about 12 desiccant packets. Make sure there is plenty of air inside you will need it to get the water out without it getting back on the plastic. 2. Place plastic bag with Bridge Nylon and desiccant packets under heat lamp for 68 hours. Mine is not enough that it partially melted the black spool on one round of this when I was first figuring out how to do it. 3. Transfer Bridge Nylon and desiccant packets to new, dry plastic bag. 4. Dump the water out of the previous plastic bag. And, yes, I mean dump. You do not just get a little water doing this. You get a ton of large drops and some small pools in portions of the bag. 5. Turn previous ""wet"" bag inside out to let it dry. 6. Repeat until you no longer get pools of water in the bottom of the bag. Expect to have to do this probably somewhere around 56 times.

But I was looking for a pair of casual ankle boots and since Merrell has no compelling offerings I found these.  I admit to being suspicious of such an oddball brand.  But here is the essence of my experience with these shoes after one solid day on my feet with them.

 They are soft.  The leather is soft and the soles are thin and pliable.  Consequently they felt immediately familiar to my foot right out of the box.

 They are a bit flat.  Yes, there is a nicely molded and removable insole but it is not deeply contoured for arch support.  If you have bad arches you should probably plan on ditching the insoles for some that are more supportive.  Note: I would have to say that this is a NICE design feature of these shoes.  My feet were comfortable after many hours walking in these shoes but I am not heavy and was only walking on flat surfaces.  Your situation and experience may differ.

 They are nicely crafted, perhaps a cut above the standard Chinese shoes that flood the market today.  The uppers are nicely lined and, as mentioned above, the shoes have removable / replaceable insoles.  The lateral heel support is good.

 They are fairweather shoes.  Do not plan to wear these in weather.  They will not keep your feet dry or warm.  They are just lined leather.

7043,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Amazing!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

7051,"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written. The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, ""For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority."" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne. The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate",The Book of the World is a great book!,THERE IS MORE TO THIS THAN MEETS THE EYE...

Ever since its debut, Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion. SP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on and I would recommend too, after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your AntiVirus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Antivirus is not supported, although","Microsoft has decided to make the product ""secure""",You can get SP2 elsewhere too!

7082,"The first time I heard this album in high school, I liked it. On successive listens, though, Bob Dylans Blood on the Tracks has revealed itself to be an absolute masterpiece and, like Joni Mitchells Blue, a gold standard of breakup albums. From the perfect opening track Tangled Up In Blue to the bittersweet Shelter From the Storm to the hostile, angry Idiot Wind, this is both a firstrate Dylan album and an unusually honest examination of a failed marriage. In the past, I Have been critical of ""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts. My general opinion has always been that for nearly nine minutes, it sits there and does not really fit or add all that much; I have always considered it a distraction from the overall narrative. Having listened to this album many times since then, I still do not love it, but I have learned to accept it and even get some enjoyment from the track. While it does not quite fit in to the overall narrative, its a perfectly fine piece of music and like everything else here, an example of topnotch storytelling. In all fairness, Bob Dylan has never been a perfectionist; he is recorded some of the best records you will ever hear, but hes never recorded a flawless album like Astral Weeks, Kid A, or Sgt. Pepper. Nonetheless, art does not need to be perfect to be brilliant or great, and while Blood on the Tracks is not a perfect album, its still one of the greatest albums ever recorded. ""Tangled Up In Blue"" and ""Shelter From the Storm"" rank as two of Dylan's best compositions which is saying a lot and as far as lamentations of lost love go, there is not many pieces of artin film, music, or literaturethat are",Very good album,Superb; one of Dylan's best albums

There are always worries of course about doing it correctly but the minute I read the blurb about Marissa Meyer's Cinder, I was not one bit concerned. It seemed so awesomely different that I felt even if it did not resemble the story of Cinderella, the uniqueness of the story would be enough. Well not only did it hit the mark on resembling Cinderella, but it was a totally awesome remake. I could not put this book down! The GooTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry Firstly, this book made me incredibly jealous that I did not come up with this idea first. I could not have thought of a crazier but more awesome combination in regards to a Cinderella remake. I honestly thought all of the characters were so well done and Meyer has a way with creating characters that really stick with you. I loved Cinder, Iko, Prince Kai and Peony. All the supporting characters were awesome as well. Meyer achieved the goal of making me LOATHE Cinder's stepmother as well as Queen Levana. The world building in this novel is incredible. It was so detailed and unique, and at some points, I almost felt like such a place existed. In kind of a scary moment, I actually thought that at some point in the very far future, we might actually have human's that are part machine. We already have people with artificial limbs...why cannot some of the elements of the book actually come true? I thought it was fun to think of a world like this. I adored the romance element between Prince Kai and Cinder even though it was predictable. I still enjoy when the underdog is gushed about and adored.

7094,"I bought these for my wife, she has very small feet that are slightly wide for the size...her last pair of very expensive running shoes gave her a painful callus on the ball of her foot between the last 2 toes.

On a whim, I decided to try these out as the price was fair and the reviews are great! As it turns out it was a great idea. My wife loves them. A little background on her: she is a great woman but very picky about shoes because nothing seems comfortable to her and if it is comfortable it is usually not the most attractive shoe. She works at an assisted living center for the elderly and is on her feet all day. We are an active family and frequently take our kids on long walks or walk/jog together.

7121,"When I started typing, we had manual typewriters clickity clack and ting for the return. Electric typewriters were available but not at our high school. By the time I went to college, I had an electric typewriter and actually charged $1 per page to type papers for fellow students. Although at that time, it was not particularly lucrative, it was the practice that became invaluable to me. As a business owner now, I cannot tell you how much time I save in having good typing skills. I try to tell my kids that they will never regret being a good typist. They still do not get it but hopefully... So the point is, to be a good typist, you have to practice and you have to practice by using good technique as well or breaking the bad habits will be almost impossible. For example, although I can type at about 70 words per minute, I still only use one of the shift keys no matter what hand I need the capital letter. Oh well. What this all means is that you need to have a way to practice in a methodical manner. Mavis Beacon does a good job of going through the keys in the method and order I remember back in high school. There are plenty of ways to practice and then test yourself as well. Each person has a profile to keep track of your own progress. The lessons can also be read out loud and there are instructional videos as well. It is a little hokey at times but it gets the point across. It is not super fun so that kids have games and things to play if they are trying it but I actually think it is perfect for young teens or adults learning to",This was the most important practice I have ever had.,You Will Never Regret Learning Good Typing Skills

7126,"I picked one of these up along with a USB adapter for use in arcade and 2D action games on my PC. I like the controller, but I have to say it is not quite as good as it is often talked up to be. This Saturn controller has a reputation for having a very nice DPad and comfortable buttons, making it ideal for 2D fighting games, arcade games, and platformers.

It works. I like it. It is a solid controller... just not really anything special. I have large hands and I would say though the controller is still very usable, it is a bit small for them and I start to feel mild aches after maybe an hour of play. The buttons are pretty nice. I like the bottom three buttons better than the top three as they feel better on my fingers. The shoulder buttons are clicky, which is odd to get used to after using modern controllers like the 360 where they are more smooth to accommodate as triggers, etc. They are not bad though.

The controller itself looks very stylish and I suppose if nothing else it is a nice piece of functional swag to have.

I cannot give the controller a strong recommendation unless you actually own a Sega Saturn. It is decent, but there are other options out there which are equally as good or better for cheaper and less hassle. If you need a Sega Saturn controller specifically, well, here you go. If you are like me and you want one just because it looks cool and you have a need to be different, well... it is not bad, but not that great either.","Nice and comfortable, but not as good","Not all it was hyped up to be, but still a good controller"

The 50ft cable works great 9.4Gb/s. I have attached both pictures to show that the test was valid.
If you want 10Gig, do not get this 100FT cable. Get the 50Ft or buy a proper cat 7 that has a circular cross section. I am not even sure you can categorize a cable that is flat as cat 7, since that would probably go against the spec. But I am not sure as I have not read the spec, so take that comment with a grain of salt.

I am also not happy with how these cables are packaged. They are wound into spools ok, that is fine but the spools are halved before winding. Therefore, there is a sharp kink created at the center of every cable. This is done in order to have both ends of the cable on the outside of the spool. While this may seem like a nice thing, folding the cable in half first, with that degree of angle, is bad for the cable. I do not want my cables prekinked.

Luckily the packaging methods did not affect the performance on my 50 footer, so I will definitely use that. I will keep the 100 footer as a 1G cable, since the test results show it can perform that way. It being flat is kind of nice, so I guess I will cut my losses since this was a lightning deal when I bought them.",Good Cable: tuesday,"50FT OK, 100FT sucks"

One really nice thing was that the instructions acknowledged that when playing a freeforall that players may choose to form temporary alliances and that is fine. This game is a lot more reliant on cards than others we have played, with most of the action on the battlefield being determined by the cards and how they were being played.

7154,"Dragon Naturally Speaking works well after you have ""trained"" it.  The more you use it, the less errors it will generate.  Is it perfect or live up to the accuracy level the developers say?  Not in my experience, but maybe I need to keep using it to get better performance.  Only time will tell.

I used version 9 before and it was just ""okay.""  The newer version performs better.

My laptop is an aging vista in need of a replacement and this software can be a bit of a resource hog on this platform.  Newer systems should not have much difficulty.  So far, it works well from microphone dictation.  I have also used a digital voice recorder with less than stellar results.  In fairness to the software, I am using the recorder ""hands free"" while driving so the background noise is significantly higher.

In the end, Dragon's performance depends on the user.  Keep with it and you will do well.  If you are impatient and expect instant gratification you my be dissappointed.",Easy to use AVS,Worth it as long as you put some effort into it.

7156,"I bought two of these for my 2yearold twin boys as summer was coming to an end, so did not get many chances to use them, alas. One of my boys readily let us put the Puddle Jumper on him and enjoyed the extra freedom he had in the pool, though we still had to keep an eye on him 100 of the time. My other twin would not let us put the Puddle Jumper on him, but perhaps will next summer. I think this is a very good product, but it definitely should not be substituted for the watchful eye of an adult who is ready to assist the toddler.

UPDATE 8/7/2011: Here we are the next summer and both of my twin boys now 3 years old LOVE their Puddle Jumpers and will not swim without them. I had hoped this would be the case and am very happy that it is.

7158,"I am a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps  a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" cross between hard cream  soap rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush  the ""Marco method"" if you are new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it  you will not regret it, and provides a good, close, irritationfree shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat I shave in the shower  store my soap there, so there is a lot of water and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses  fresh cut grass. It is very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red  white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso disappointing, since I loved the scent, but neither the green or the white because any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.","It makes a nice, dry soap",Not just for men!

However, as soon as I tried playing music on them... something was terribly wrong. All I could hear was bass. And not clear, vibrant bass either. Muddy, garbled, muffled bass, albeit insanely loud enough to give me an earache within a few minutes. Highs and mids are mushy, weak, almost imperceptible.

If you care anything about fidelity and for the record I am not even that picky, generally pretty happy with the playback quality on my $15 Sony headphones and $25 gaming headset, do not even consider getting these. If you listen exclusively to brostep, trap, mainstream hip hop or any combination of those: you might enjoy these. If you listen to actual music, especially music with any semblance of dynamic range: avoid these like the plague.

7177,"Timeless Comedy about Little Tramp arriving in the Yukon as a prospector looking for Gold and finding hilarity, success and romance. Classic sequences abound from the unforgettable Shoe eating scene to the dance of the dinner rolls and the Cabin teetering over the cliff. Chaplin is brilliant in this picture as the lonely and courageous Tramp. His story in this one is somewhat simpler than his later films but perhaps that is what makes this his best. This is a simply told tale that is brought off incredibly well. Chaplin's film and character is the most miraculous combination of slapstick and sentiment ever seen. We relate to this tramp and empathize with his plight and we feel joy when he finds purpose. The cast adds immeasurably, particularly the unforgettable Mack Swain as the burly prospector, Big Jim Mckay who so memorably chases Chaplin through the cabin as he mistakes him for a chicken. The actor and Chaplin play off each other incredibly well and there friendship is one of the film's highlights. Georgia Hale is a gorgeous lead. Independant and yet, vulnerable, her character is probally Chaplin's best developed female lead with the possible exception of Paulette Goddard in ""Modern Times1935"". Hale's character is in need of fullfillment and redemption, just as much as Charlie is and the conclusion where both end up with each other romantically, we feel that she has won just as much as he has. She is better off with earning the love of this good man. It should be noted that thsi ending is probally one of the only REAL happy endings in Chaplin's career. There is no ambiguity or message. Things just work out and that is the way it is. Chaplin's film strikes a chord with it is emotional complexity.

He has made some extremely wellliked games in the past, and this takes pieces of all of them and puts them all together into this one. It is a very complex games with a lot of moving parts, options, and time taken probably around 3 hours. If you would like a good idea of the type of game this is, take a look at Agricola and Le Havre. IF YOU KNOW UWE'S GAMES You are not going to see a ton of originality here. This almost feels like Uwe took Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and blew it up 50x. It is physically a much larger game, a much longer game, a ton more options. COMPONENTS It is fairly standard fair for Uwe's games. The pieces are all perfectly sturdy. The art is OK, but nothing spectacular. I have two gripes, and that is for the colorblind. Two of the colors people can play as, blue and.....I guess it is bluegreen, are FAR too similar in color, and I really cannot see the difference unless they are right next to each other I am not very colorblind, but just have trouble telling very similar colors apart unless they are right next to each other.

7214,"Jhann Jhannsson born 19 September 1969 is an Icelandic composer identified with minimalist, drone, and electronic music. Jhann is known for his film music, primarily for his Oscarnominated, Golden Globewinning score for James Marsh's The Theory of Everything and his Oscarnominated score for Denis Villeneuve's Sicario. This album is based on the Orpheus story. Tackling themes of death, rebirth, and memory inspired by the Greek myth of Orpheus and French filmmaker Jean Cocteaus 1950 take on the story, the album calls to my mind the work of Arvo Part and Phillip Glass. Jhannssons music treads some heavy terrain here and covers a lot of ground, the compositions at times fragile and yearning, haunting and cinematic, lush and hopeful mirroring, of course, the story of Orpheus descent into the underworld. Its not all darkness, though; the songs, especially towards the second half of the album, are often piercingly beautiful and achingly alive. Orpheus is of the most enduring stories at the intersection of music and love. The ancient Greek paragon of allencompassing musical talent and fatalistic passion has inspired artists of all stripes in all eras. In his new album, Orphe, his simple, haunting sketches of instrumental poetry use the familiar tale and elements of a particularly famous telling of it to comment on changes in his own life. Jean Cocteau's impressionistic 1950 film Orphe transplanted the legend to postwar Paris, and includes the poet of the title listening to mysterious voices on the radio. According to Jhannsson's liner notes, it is an effect he chose to duplicate in ""a period that saw old relationships die and new ones begin, old lives left behind and a new life begun in a new city."" The tracks are as follows: Flight from the City A Song for Europa The Drowned World A Deal",The Modern Art of Love,A meditation on beauty and the process of creation.

7229,"This is a folio or ""book style"" case for the iPad Mini. The iPad is held in place using a sewn in holder made of a semiflexible plastic; the iPad snaps into place, protecting the corners of the iPad. It holds the iPad in place securely. The magnetic latch does it is job to keep the iPad case closed when not in use, but it is not a smart cover that automatically locks the screen when closed.

The material that is used is a durable padded vinyl that somewhat mimics leather, but not objectionably so  it does not appear cheap. The fit and finish is nicely done. The edges of the case overlap the iPad similar to a book cover, further protecting the edges of the iPad. The inside of the case is covered with a suedelike material that protects the screen.

This case has indents on the inside cover of the case that allows the case to be adjusted for 3 positions for horizontal viewing. The cover can also be folded over, with a narrower incline for typing, which works well.

The snapin assembly which protects the corners and the additional typing position are important differences between this case and Belkin's cheaper cases.

7232,"I remember my initial reaction to this album was ""Cake has finally made a bad album"". While I no longer think of it as bad, it is definitely only average and one that takes longer to settle in than many of their other efforts. Probably the biggest change here on this CD from COMFORT EAGLE is the prominence of synthesizers, especially on ""Carbon Monoxide"", the band's cover of 70s soft rock band Bread's ""The Guitar Man"", and the near theremin sounding synth on the sole hit from this album ""No Phone"". Others have mentioned singer John McCrea is trying to do more conventional singing on this album but I do not hear that much of a change from his typical talk/sing style like an alternative Neil Diamond. HIGHLIGHTS: ""Wheels"" probably SHOULD have been the single. It is upbeat, and its ""Wheeeeels..keep on spinnin' round/spinnin' round/spinnin' round"" chorus is almost immediately singalong worthy. ""No Phone"" has a similarly catchy hook but the insistent moog tends to grate a bit with repeated airings. ""Dime"" is a clever lament from the point of view of the tiny tender, much like Schoolhouse Rock's ""I am Just a Bill On Capitol Hill"". ""I am silverplated/I am underrated/You will not even pick me up because I am not enough for a local phone call"" LOWS: ""She will Hang the Baskets"" is a return of more country tinged material from the band but it is not as compelling as past fare has been. ""Carbon Monoxide"" comes off like grating older B52s apt comparison whoever first made it BOTTOM LINE: If you had asked me the first week we had this album for my rating, I would have said 1 1/2 stars.

7274,"I bought this album the day it came out and it quickly became my favorite Pantera album. After several months, I reevaluated that opinion and I now consider it my third favorite Pantera album behind Vulgar Display and Cowboys. In a way, it is both their heaviest album and their lightest. The heavier moments are more intense than ever before, but they mix lighter moments in more often. The two least heavy songs, ""Suicide Note Pt. 1"" and ""Floods"" are actually my two favorites. The outro to ""Floods"" is beautiful atypical of Pantera, eh? and is my favorite piece of music by Pantera. I used to replay it repeatedly. Those two songs are each worth the price of the CD alone. Well, that is at least $30 worth of material for $15, so there is no need for me to continue since you have no reason to hesitate. However, I better continue anyway. Despite what some critics say, this album contains more variety than your average Pantera album. It contains some extremely fast screamers, mixed with some very heavy midtempo songs and some lighter tracks that I already mentioned. Some tracks are better than others, but there are not any songs that I totally dislike. The album is not as grooveoriented as Vulgar Display, but Dimebag RIP still does an amazing job. He was undoubtedly one of the greatest guitarists in metal and this album further establishes that position. The lyrical style is a bit more negative than on Vulgar Display and is closer to the lyrical style of Far Beyond Driven, though with more rants against commercialism. This is my favorite album lyrically and the lyrics are very fitting given the album's very angry and aggressive musical style. It is extremely cathartic. Therapists and counselors should be handing this",Pretty Light and More Heavy Than Vulgar Display,Underrated to say the least

7283,"First off, do not be fooled by a lifetime warranty. That just means the knife was so cheap to make that they can throw replacement ones at you until the cows come home and they still made money. Second, german steel is tempered very, very soft. 58 on the rockwell is pretty soft, and while this will equate to an edge that resists chipping, it will dull extremely quickly. But the real issue is the quality of the heat treat, and that is where these factory forged knives fall short. Most good knives are tempered to 60 rockwell and the heat treating is much more extensive. These german knives wusthof and henkels are made heavier to compensate for a poor heat treat. The edge on these knives is also usually about 40 degrees inclusive, which is very durable, but you are basically cutting with a hatchet, not a scalpel. Good chef's knives are 1517 degrees, which is an edge that these soft german knives simply cannot tolerate. Similarly, avoid japanese factory made knives like shun or Myabi. I had a myabi and enjoyed it quite a bit until I learned what real chef's knives are. I do not expect people to rush out and drop $400 on carbon steel hand forged blades like I did, but for this same money, google ""oishi hammer knives"" which are factory forged, hand finished knives with a better edge and a seriously well done heat treat, for the same money. Simply put, when held against a $20 kitchenaid that I keep around for abusing with a 20 degree grind, a henkels or wusthof will feel right about the same. Moral of the story spend your money on a hand forged or hand finished knife and do not worry about a warranty. If the maker","Great, soft knife","For the money, you can do a lot better."

Since this is a 3 device license it works out to be $13 bucks per device at retail price.  On Android there are cheaper alternatives that do similar types of tracking such as seekdroid.  This seems like it would be ok for a desktop computer but keep in mind that it requires a data connection for the program to function correctly.  A phone is likely to have this connection at all times unless switched off but a desktop computer may not even be switched on until the hard drive or computer ""guts"" have been sold off or swapped out.

7300,"I am an avid crocheter and I have been dying to try Tunisian crochet, so I decided to get this set and give it a whirl.  There are 12 bamboo hooks in this set, ranging in size from 3mm to 10mm.  The metric sizes are clearly marked on the hooks, but the US sizes are not. That is not a deal breaker for me because I can easily google it to get the conversions.  Each hook has a tube attached that is kind of like the tubing used with air pumps on aquarium tanks.  Each tube has a large bamboo bead on the end of it, then there is a knot tied in the tube to keep the bead attached.  The bead is, of course, to keep your work from sliding off the end of the tube.  The tube itself is pretty long.  I just measured it, and from the tip of the hook to the bead at the end of the tube, it measures almost 47 inches, so you could make something fairly large with these.  So far they seem like good quality, durable hooks.  The hooks themselves are not at all flimsy.  They are smooth, and do not catch on my yarn.  The tubing is smaller than the hooks, but that does not matter because the hooks are used to get the correct sized loops in your work.  The tubing just holds on to your work just like circular knitting needles do.  I like that there is a slight indention in the hook where your thumb would be, for comfort while working.  I am quite happy with this set!  I did receive this set at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",Great Set for the price,not bad!

7303,"I was hoping that Oxygen Infusion Night Cream would be more nourishing and hydrating than Skyn Icelands Cloud Cream, which is a decent moisturizer but inadequate for dry skin. I was disappointed. I have very sensitive skin almost completely lacking in barrier. Without my regular concoction of serums, my skin is painfully dry in the winter. I was hopeful that Oxygen Infusion Night Cream would help maintain some hydration in my skin, but it does not do much in that department. Its not for dry skin. It does not add any value to my serums. This cream is lighter and fluffier than Cloud Cream. It either contains more water or more air. It goes on with almost no drag. But it stings and even burns if my skin is broken. I attribute this to the fragrance, which is floral and perfumey. So Oxygen Infusion Night Cream is not for sensitive skin. Among its active ingredients in Gosulin Agave. Skyn Iceland does not use silicone in its products. This is the primary reason that I Have been trying their products, as I cannot stand silicone on my skin, and its difficult to find a moisturizer without it. Gosulin Agave is a polysaccharide extracted from the Blue Agave plant. It is an alternative to silicone, as it mattifies and creates a velvety surface on the skin. The texture is more natural than silicone; it does not feel like plastic. But I find that the retexturizing agent probably gosulin agave mixed with oils and sugars in the formula balls up and leaves bits on the skin when applied. Cloud Cream contains a retexturizer, but its not gosulin agave and does not have this problem. Neither Cloud Cream nor Oxygen Infusion Night Cream have appreciable moisturizing properties.

An interface that sucks being your only option across desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and gaming console. The key words are not, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, ""only option"". The real fighting words are ""that sucks."" Some people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good oneand I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8. As it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools. For this to work, it has to work better than s. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It is flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on. The key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and do not play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage carand also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can.

7324,"The one thing that has been missing from karaoke games to date is the ability to go online and purchase more songs at any time. Singstar and the PS3 have addressed this problem. No longer are you stuck with the 30 songs that come with the game. Nor are you stuck purchasing additional collections of songs, most of which you may not even like or have never heard of. Now, you can go to the Singstore and browse through songs with corresponding music videos. A 30 second preview plays instantly. It is easy to purchase individual songs, and each song on a wired connection takes only about 1 minute to download. A wifi connection may take slightly longer. Downloads occur in the background so you can sing other songs in the meantime. The whole experience is seamless and realtime. Compared to the instant access to new songs, other positive features are really of secondary importance but here they are: Fairly easy to use graphical user interface although it is cumbersome to change basic options like camera feed and voice reduction.

7332,"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 of course I will reevaluate it once we get our actual W2s. If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behindthescenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I am sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to rebuy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to efile, instead of rebuying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress. I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction. And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I have used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I have used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It is kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is hopefully in the upward direction. What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

7353,"This album is virtually the same as the Australian version of the TNT album. Around this time, 1975, AC/DC in Melbourne Australia had a very big skinhead following. They`d come to their shows wanting loud and tough rock`n`roll, and AC/DC would deliver all the time. That`s why, i think, this album has a very loud and tough sound. There`s nothing nice and fluffy about this album, it`s just loud guitars and loud vocals. I personally think this could be their best album. The vander and young production is fantastic and they really captured the AC/DC live pub sound on this record. I never saw AC/DC in Australia in the seventies as i was too young but many older people here that i`ve met have told me that this album TNT/High Voltage sounds very similar to what they sounded live in Melbourne pubs. TNT is probably my favorite song on the album. It`s only 3 chords and it works brilliantly. AC/DC were the first band to chant Oi Oi Oi in this song and they were the first rock band to use bagpipes in a rock song long way to the top, 20 years before great bands like Dropkick Murphys tried it. I don`t know why bagpipes aren`t used more in rock music. They sound heaps better than trumpets or saxaphones. This album helped introduce AC/DC to British and European audiences who loved it as much, maybe more, than Australians.",TNT/High Voltage sounds very similar to what they sounded live in Melbourne pub.,Possibly their best

7357,"Fourth installment for the Moore brothers but it deals with their hard nosed, spoiled, opinionated sister, Lilah. What a character that was totally clueless about the real world where people have to work for a living. Especially those doing menial tasks and blue collar work. That challenge from her brothers was a rude wake up call that not everyone is as privileged to not want for anything, but the happiest people are those that make their own way and can fend for themselves. Lilah learned to appreciate what was worked for and Cole made it that much easier for her to begin that journey. Cole Bennet is gorgeous and the complete opposite of anyone Lilah has ever been attracted to. He has worked his entire life and his family background is not without its fair share of hard knocks and violence. Have to say that it took me until close to the end of the book before I even liked Lilah but she was respectful and tolerant of Cole's mother and the situation that happened and was a shoulder and sounding board for Cole when he needed one. Cole is so much like her brothers in being protective of women, stubborn and totally handsome.

These grips took the slip and the worry out of my cutting.

7378,"After using VideoStudio for many years, I started looking for another video editing program that is faster and could output 3D Bluray. Several months ago, I bought and used PowerDirector 12 and was impressed by how fast it authored and burned 3D Blurays. This version is even faster. I have burned several 3D discs and am amazed at its speed. A short compilation video of a trio of scenes took less than three minutes. A sixminute puppet show took less than eight minutes. I am used to starting the process and then coming back hours later, hoping that everything worked. With this software, I can try multiple options and not be as concerned with time. I generally use BDRE discs so wasting discs ""creating coasters"" is not an issue. Editing video is similar to other programs but there is still a slight learning curve. As I learn more about this program and I had only used PD12 for a few months so not a lot of experience overall, it appears that it will expand to meet my needs. I have downloaded some menus and templates from the Cyberlink website and appreciate the other users' contributions. I tried the EZ video option where the program will attempt to analyze the input files and select the project options. It took quite a while to process the video and the result was similar to what I would choose. Maybe I did not enable some feature but overall I did not find it worthwhile. For 3D video, I am using a JVC Everio GSTD1 and it works quite well. I have also tried a Fujifilm W3 but have not been able to find the proper combination to output a usable disc.

I was one of the handful of employees in the store that regularly accepted doing them, and was good at putting them on. Needless to say, I have a lot of experience with screen protectors. These screen protectors are wonderful! For the price, you honestly cannot beat them. The power support ones sold in the Apple store were phenomenal, and back in the day, cheap screen protectors were often horrible. Well, clearly that has changed.

A ""pro"" tip for screen protectors: Take a microfiber cloth and a screen cleaning solution, and make sure every single piece of the screen is dust free and clean. That is the ONLY key to success. I did not use the ones in the pack, so I cannot speak to that, but if you clean it really really well, you will not have any problems.

My garage door opener is a LiftMaster Model Number 1345, which accommodates this Keypad ModelIt is important to check before buying. It is EXACTLY the same unit as is sold by LiftMaster directly but their price is about doubled compared to this one.

Installation was a breeze! You only need to program the keypad unit with your selected code and then install it to an outside wall. The instructions clearly layout the HOW TOOs. It is important to Program the keypad first and try it in the selected location BEFORE permanently installing it.

I have two garage doors with separate LiftMaster openers for each. It was not clear to me that this keypad will allow you to program separate code numbers for each door's opener. It does not specifically say that you can do so in the instructions. So I just went ahead and tried programming each opener with separate codes ... and it worked. So now I can open either door from the same keypad. You can program the same code into both openers but that seems silly to me. You do not need to buy a keypad for each door.

Another nice feature is that you can program temporary codes, let us say for maintenance techs or visiting relatives. So you will not have to keep handing out sets of keys or have to keep changing your permanent code numbers.

7411,"The range and breadth of this album is quite remarkable for a mostly straight ahead folk rock record. A more fully realized and visceral effort than The Monsters of Folk experiment. There is some Gram Parsons here ""Middle Brother"", as well as other great ghostly voices culled from the grave try John Lennon, ""Theater""; or Crosby, Stills and Nash, ""Million Dollar Bill"", and you will swear ""Someday"" Janis Joplin? is a long lost soul cut from the Jerry Wexler archives. The arrangements are so simple they are almost forgettable, but that leaves even more room for the saltdustygrain of John J. McCauley III's soulful voice. He is a could sing the phonebook kind of singer. But his voice is closer to the folk origins and characters alluded to in Greil Marcus'  ""The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes."" It is a voice like that of Howlin' Wolf, who Sam Phillips describe as the place ""where the soul of man, never dies."" If you need further proof, then digest the timeless version of ""Goodnight Irene"" from Deer Tick's ""Born on Flag Day."" Taylor Goldsmith's plaintive approach and thoughtful songwriting provide a nice balance see ""Thanks for Nothing"" or ""Wilderness"" and sprinkles a bit of grain himself reminiscent of Elvis Costello.

7429,"This product is pretty innovative as it is installed via USB and not cd rom. Keep in mind, to try this product, you must uninstall all other security software. I tried it on a separate laptop in case I was not happy with it. The one major thing I liked was that when it was scanning, it did not affect the other processes in the same way that macafee causes a slow down or momentary freezing of what you are working on otherwise. I think it will be a matter of living with this software for a while before making a final decision on its overall effectiveness and how the renewal process works. In researching, I have noticed that there have been complaints about the product not functioning if it is not renewed at exactly the due date. I do not know if this is true but it is worth mentioning. I have it marked on my calendar to see when the year is up. Otherwise, it seems to be a good, innovative product with possibilities. As with anything new on the market, time does have a way of showing the glitches and hopefully, the creators will be constantly upgrading the software to move ahead with the times.

I will try to edit my review over time with updates or oddities with the product until the renewal date when I will make a decision whether or not to renew.",Very innovative and a great product,An interesting new approach to internet security

7431,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",great kit,good kit with some caveats

7462,"This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used. I liked the 2009 version. Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of selfhelp legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move. Also, you are supposed to upgrade to a new version every year. If you do not, the software will not update itself after the end of the version year i.e., December 31, 2011 for the 2011 version which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estaterelated laws. This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again. Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products. Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations. How simple? For example, in my case I would like to attach a condition to my will that the people I would like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.

7464,"Sixteen 16 Most Requested Songs is a Patti Page CD that tries its best to give us sixteen of her greatest hits. Unfortunately you cannot really do that with just a single CGreat dismay but this one does stand out as one of her better single CD compilations. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is typical for this CD series. I must admit they could have done a better job with that rendering of Patti on the front cover of the artwork. However, this is a minor disappointment. The track set begins with Patti performing ""Tennessee Waltz."" Unfortunately, this is not my favorite rendition of this ballad; there is a backup group of singers that is superfluous; Patti never needed that and even if it worked it does not go along with this tender ballad. ""Gentle On My Mind"" sparkles like gold as Patti sings this country flavored ballad with panache and all her heart and soul. Patti was meant to sing a great ballad like this! She delivers this flawlessly; and I could listen to her sing this tune again and againand sometimes I do! ""Scarlet Ribbons For Her Hair"" is a beautiful tune which I first heard from Harry Belafonte; but when Patti sings this number she makes it all her own with her fine timing and diction. Patti's rendition of ""Scarlet Ribbons"" is THE definitive interpretation of this ballad! ""Try To Remember,"" a song from The Fantasticks, is equally beautiful and although the chorus adds to the number Patti could easily have handled this all on her own.

At that time, and for several subsequent years, I would have emphatically rated this as a 5star product. Being expensive, I initially used this stuff selectively to protect my Japanese Maples and Crepe Myrtles from the Japanese Beetles... and this product performed admirably at doing so. Being so impressed, I began gradually justifying this expense for the protection of more and more of my landscape against various infestations. Over the years I would come to use this stuff to protect my dogwoods, azaleas, rhododendrons, Japanese Maples, Crepe Myrtles, and just about every other bush and shrub in my landscape. This stuff was nothing short of miraculous: gone were the aphids and their associated ""dew"" from my shrubs. Gone were the white flies, the leaf miners, the japanese beetles, and so one. I mean, this stuff is truly impressive, but there is one critter that this product simply does not take care of and this particular critter, the mite, is what has opened my eyes to the downside of this seemingly awesome product. For the last few years as my use of this stuff has become more allinclusive in my landscape, I suddenly began experiencing seemingly massive mite outbreaks on a number of my bushes in late spring and early summer. The first time this happened, I did not think much of if but treated with other products to bring the situation under control and reminded myself to make sure I treated these bushes sufficiently with the Tree and Shrub Protect the following season to prevent a repeat.

7505,"Being a Gen Xer, I straddle the divide between the total luddites who distrust digital information and the younger generation that is probably comfortable with never turning pages.  I like the feel of paper books, but I also see the value in digital technology.

Anyway, I read a lot of nonfiction, mostly academic books for my day job as a law professor.  I tend not to like to write in my books, which becomes a problem for keeping track of useful parts of books that I might want to come back to as source references for my own academic writing.

The Moleskine Passions Book Journal is a pretty good solution to my dilemma.  It is got 154 pages with tab dividers by letters AZ for taking notes on individual books, with another 75 pages of all purpose note space.  Each page let us you keep track of the title, author, publisher, date of publication, date read, and whatever notes you want to keep.

It is handsomely crafted, with a leather cover, page ribbons sewn into the binding, back cover folders for keeping little papers, and an attached rubber band for keeping the book closed.

The main drawback that I can see to this product is that taking notes on books that you have read has to be more efficient in a Word or Excel file on a computer  you can take more notes, you can search for specific words, and so on.

Honestly, it is pretty solid. It seems to have more of an indie/rock feel than TIH. Quesadilla is a weird little number that has dark verses and happy, synthy choruses. Lisa Baby is a little slower, kind of like Different Colors from TIH. Next in Line is another fun one with spoton vocal delivery. Anna Sun is a CLASSIC. It is got melodic vocal delivery, a slight sense of rocking out, and is just beautiful. Tightrope is fast and melodic. Jenny sounds exactly like a Killers song, with its speed and synth. Shiver Shiver is downright funky, and as a bonus, has pretty relatable lyrics. Lions is a cute interlude. Iscariot is a very slow, deep song. I really did not know WTM could leave so much of an impact on me! Fixin' sounds like if you crossed Fall out Boy with Mexicanstyle dance pop. I can Lift a Car is a little more rockin', kind of like U2, and closes the album well. I would recommend this album if you like The Killers, modern Fall out Boy, and Panic!

There are a wide variety of brushes, textures, and styles to play with, and even if you are really hopeless, the coolest part is that ability to pull in a photo and sic autopaint on it... you can choose from a bunch of artistic styles and then let it go at it. You see each stroke being rapidly applied, each second bringing slightly more detail. Simply stop the process when it looks the way you want it and then apply a different style, or begin manually touching it up.

On a scale of 110, I would give the video a 10, the audio a 9.3, the only reason it loses .7 of a point, is because of a whistle from wind noise and the rain resistance a 10!

Otherwise, I would knock off 10 dollars. But anyway, on to the review! The additions to this game are very nice indeed. The new civilizations are well balanced and very well thought out. They have their strengths and weaknesses of course. Two new civilization bonuses are now here: seafaring and agricultural. In my opinion, these SOUND weak on the surface, but they are very useful underneath; they are selfexplanatory as well; one helps your ships and gives you extra commerce in the water, and the other let us you produce more food. There are a few new units in the main game, the greatest addition being the TOW infantry in the Modern Age, with an attack of 12 and defense of 14. The best thing about them? This unit is in the Warriorupgrade line; meaning, your swoardmen/med. Infantry/guerillas can be upgraded to units that humble the 16.8.2 Tank. Note: they have a bonus against armored units, but Modern Armor still outclass them when the MA attacks. I have a few complaints: The AI still cheats. Those who play the game know what I am talking about. Also, new wonders and a few other ones, and new city improvements do not show up when you take a bird's eye view of an individual city.

Perhaps the best example I can find is ""angels"" by the Xx. Mind blowing. I cannot wait to listen to everything on these phones with the Comply tips. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I should preface this by saying that I am definitely not an ""audiophile."" I do not really know how to interpret the specs of this device, and I do not really care. I wanted to try out nice headphones after using cheap ones, and I had a rewards program that offered these ones for around the number of points that I had. I have mostly been testing them in my iPhone 4S, although I also evaluated them on an iPad 2 and a 2012 Macbook Air. I tested the medium and large earbud covers, in both the allsilicone and foam/silicone variants. The first thing I noticed was that Lana del Rey sounded like she was singing right in the room with me. The second thing I noticeTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry ""hey, where is the bass?"" For pop music, dance, dub, electronic, you will be left wanting. Everything will sound so crystal clearand yet. It is like when you go to a high end restaurant and everything is just so, but you are still hungry and you get home and eat cheezits. I am sure the audiophiles will jump on me for this. I am not looking something to shake my bowels, but I do want the bass line to jump.

The interaction of characters, some well known and other newly introduced were excellent.

I noted no format issues, use of spelling or grammar errors, or other such faults that are sometimes found in ""indy,"" novels.

7611,"I liked the movie overall. The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect. I think this movie is more ""about"" religion vs science, than anything else. Even extraterrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second. Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character Dr. Ellie Arroway, who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself. Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did if it was not for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information. I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world. I am not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it is author; not about me. This movie has a strong undertone A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director: This undertone is all about the battle between 1 sound scientific reasoning and logic and 2 the singleminded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves. The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason. I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie little spoiler: Palmer Joss: Our job",I liked the movie overall,My thoughts
7612,"But cannot give it five stars.

Bought it because Naturalizer stopped making their Mai Tai shoe, which was a twin of the Mimosa.  Now I find the Lifestride Mimosa is becoming scarce.  Both are/were great, comfortable shoes.  Why shoe manufacturers change out basic, comfortable styles is beyond me.

With its low heel and soft cross straps, the Mimosa is very comfortable.  I need a wide shoe and the extra wide width is tough to find in a shoe nice enough to wear to fancy events.  Takes no time to break it in.  It is comfortable when I go dancing, which is eery week.  I do add Dr. Scholl's For Her Sole Expressions insoles for a bit more cushion, but it is not really needed.

I have them in White, Black, Camel, and Red.  I would buy more colors, but they are not always available in my size  width.

My one quibble, the reason I cannot give these shoes five stars, is that after a year or so of intermittent wear, no more than once a week, they tend to deteriorate, fast.  In one case, the elastic on the heel strap broke.  That is easy to repair.  In another, though, the upper materials started to flake off!  Not sure if using sprayon cleaners to wipe off the dirt was the culprit or it is just cheap manmade materials.  It is a disappointment and sent me looking for replacements, which are tough to find now.",Love it!,I LOVE this Shoe!

7616,"This is my 3rd Elago iPhone case.
Thus far all the designs have been lightweight yet durable, super slim fit, protective, attractive.

The white case looks great with my black iPhone 5s most pictures of this product show it with a whitefaced iPhone.
I really like the White/Blue contrast: it has a fresh, polished, sleek look and feel  to it.

1 star because the blue panel appears, in all the pictures I have seen, to be brushed aluminium. While I still find the case very attractive, I was disappointed to discover that the color panel does not look anything like it appears in pictures.

I rewired it to coilsplit the Dream 180 humbucker pickups and had a problem where when I pulled up on the volume to engage the coilsplit, the presson knob would come off it has split knurled shafts on the controls and it used presson knobs. With these knobs I was able to tighten the setscrew to ensure the knob stays put. Since the shafts were split I put a tiny Vshaped bit of guitar string in the split so that the setscrew did not crush the shaft and tilt to one side.

Not only did these knobs solve the problem, they look MUCH better than the old ones did with just that extra touch of craftsmanship that was missing from the stock knobs and a real concern when trying to buy replacement knobs sight unseen over the Internet. I would certainly buy these again in the future!

7637,"I was eagerly waiting for the release of this album.  If you liked any of Fernando's other CDs, this one is a mustbuy!  Fernando can take an old hymn and create a beautiful piece of music  on this CD, he does ""Pass  Me Not"", a hymn you might not be familiar with.
The first song on  the CD, ""This Good Day"" is quite upbeat and has a tune that  really sticks in your head.  Fernando has a song on this album that is about  a homeless woman, and another about a man with Alzheimer's.  Fernando did a  lot of touring this past year and he wrote a song called ""Lonely  Road"" for his wife Margee, who he misses greatly when he is on the road  a lot.
If you have an opportunity to see Fernando Ortega in concert, GO!  I have seen him several times and he is such a humble man.  He is also  extremely funny and he has people rolling in the aisles with laughter one  minute and tearing up with a touching song the next minute.
I would also  recommend all his previous albums, especially ""This Bright Hour""  and ""Breaking of the Dawn"".  His ""Hymns and  Meditations"" is in a class by itself  the most beautiful collection  of hymns that I own.  You simply must hear ""Come Thou Fount of Every  Blessing"" from that album!  It is nothing short of incredible, but not  in a showy way.  If you see him in concert, you will probably get to see/hear  his cellist Cameron Stone who has been touring with Fernando and playing on  his albums for years.
I hope I have convinced you to order this new release  from Fernando today!  You will not be sorry you did!",This is definitely a must buy.,This one deserves 10 stars!
7638,"This review is from: Celestial Seasonings Nutcracker Sweet, Christmas Black Tea, 20 Count Teabagss Pack of 6 Grocery

This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so wonderful and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you did not drink it.

So many of us want this yearround that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe  Save.

If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. I am supersensitive to caffeine. But at least this ""regular"" version is a great start to my day.

I agree that you can find this tea at a much better price elsewhere on Amazon.  I do not know why this particular source is so overpriced.

Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally ""stretch"" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet  1 bag of PG Tips  3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.

When it is iced, sweetened with Xylitol which dissolves best while the tea is still warm, and laced with a bit of milk or Half  Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....",Excellent tea,Please offer this year-round through Subscribe & Save!

7650,"I have twin 6 yearold daughters, and they love the Cluck N' Chuck. They want to play with it almost every day, and beg me to play with it. Who knew?

The game itself is pretty simple, there are a bunch of rubber chickens, a colored die, and a chicken coop. You push the chicken coop down, and at some random point it pops up flinging the rubber chickens everywhere.

The point of the game is to roll the die, and chuck a corresponding colored chicken on top of the coop. The action is fast, so kids have to focus and react quickly. From that perspective, I would consider the game educational  more of a training the attention thing.

Within a day of playing, the kids are already better than I am. And because game play is quite fast, you can play numerous games, switching who goes first, etc. Also, the kids are not really focused on who won or lost as much as moving on to the next game.",Good game,My Kids Love This Game

Most important: These are the OEM Samsung earbuds for the Galaxy S3 Android phone or if not, they are a perfect copy. Pros: High quality connectors, sound as good as any midpriced earbud, and most of all ONE OF THE VERY FEW on the market that has remove VOLUME AND PAUSE/PLAY set up according to the ANDROID hardware/software specification. They work in the same manner as the ones for apple products, but the specification is different, so the ones for the apple products do not properly control Android devices. ProTip: The ""Headset Droid"" application is very cheap in the android store, and gives you that last bit of control you want, directing the button clicks to the right application and customizing what they do. The combination of these earbuds and that bit of software was the last bit I needed to really make my Galaxy SIII behave the way I want. I like to keep the phone in my pocket while working on the yard or doing other messy work. I run the headset cable down my shirt to keep it out of the way. This combination of earbuds and software let me control music or my audible audio book with both volume and start/stop without having to dig out the phone. I can crank the volume up when I start the mower, or whatever. Cons: Does not come with alternate silicon inear cushions. I need the large size ones, so I have to get those separately.

7658,"The seal in all Pentair pool lights is the same and a flawed design.  These things will always leak.  If you have an incandescent lamp and pay attention you can save it but the Intellibrite is an electronic design with a specialized circuit board and digital electronics will not survive any water whatsoever.  I had one installed with the pool...dead when opened it the spring.  that one was replaced under warranty.  Unfortunately, it lasted past the miserable warranty and was fogged over this spring.  intermittent for a while and then the first color failed at which point I pulled it and replaced with an Amerlite because I believe it is more robust it is just a bulb.

I liked the light and its efficiency but it is not worth the cost up front or replacement.  I will bet there is more cost to Pentair for the cord than the ""light engine"" which they charge as much for as a replacement light.  It is a $20 part, maximum.

7684,"Amistad is a powerful movie about a real incident that had a bearing on history. Let us start with some of the many positives: Spielberg is one of our era's most talented filmmakers and his skills are certainly on display here. The film is well acted by the entire cast, especially Hopkins as former president Adams and Freeman as an abolitionist businessman. These 2 actors are always good and Amistad is no exception.
Where the film falters is when Spielberg takes ""dramatic license"". Putting it simply, when he lies. The real story should have been enough for a great movie so the truth should not have to be stretched to overdramatize events. The slavetraders were lousy human beings without a doubt but they did not dump half the slaves in the ocean. Adams never met any of the Africans he defended so well and their presence in a courtroom is not believable. The speeches made in the film do not reflect 183940 attitudes, they reflect current ones. This could have and probably should have been great. As it is, it is a well told story with too many half truths.

7704,"When Silk road came on TV I was In HighSchool. After seeing the first episode I was already fascinated by the music that complimented the amazing photogaphy flawlessly. I had never before heard of Kitaro, but by the time the series finished I owned volumes 1 and 2 on vinyl Lp's.

Kitaro's work over the years had ups and downs. The entire Silk Road albums all 4 of them are among his best music ever. The theme melody is explored in subtle reinterpretations throughout all the albums. The mood changes with the geographical imagery that it is associated with, and does so in a profound and subtle way. It showcases Kitaro's excellent compositional skills. This music is evocative, diverse and soothing. It has none or very few moments of sickly sweet newage overtones that have plagued many of his later work. Instead it is very well tempered throughut. Silk Road 1 features the wonderful title track of the series. But all four albums are up to the same level of musical excellence, yet each has a unique and very different feel.

After over a decade this is one set of Kitaro albums that I still play a lot. The other one is KI. If you only ever plan to get one Kitaro album, Silk Road 1 is probably THE one to get. It is truly beautiful and timeless music.",Nice and beautiful music,epic and entrancing

I have had this for about two months now.  It is really bright.  I have it mounted to the back of my helmet.

Now it is dead when i get back from a 1hr ride.  I am checking to make sure it is fully charged, but I think we may be in a situation where the battery is degrading.

The only thing different from the female in your life's besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.

7716,"I have purchased two of these now. I had a Samsung WEP870 that I loved and it finally wore out so I bought this one from Samsung directly for the full 59.99 MSRP. After about a dozen uses, it died. Simply refused to hold a charge. Based on the durability and quality of my other Samsung products, I foolishly gave it a second try. This time, I ordered from Amazon and saved about 30 bucks, so I thought I was getting a good deal. The second headset failed within less than an hour of the first use. I purchased this headset for the one and only reason that anyone would ever need a stereo bluetooth headsetto wear when I am running and working out. Looking at the documentation, Samsung warns users to ""protect from moisture"". Pity, because the sound was amazing. Although it would not pair with my laptop, it sounded great with my Android.
So, if you are going to wear this on the train to and from work and you never plan to be around ""moisture"" sweat, rain then this product is for you. Do not think you can put this on and do an hour of cardio; however, because it will not last that long.

7719,"I am still bitter they broke up, but with a final farewell in the form of an album like this, I honestly cannot complain.
""Slaughter of the Soul"" is what the Gothenburg sound is all about.  This album defined a subgenre of metal that is now strong enough to stand on its own  and bands  like Dark Tranquility and In Flames will show you what I mean but chances  are if you are reading this, you love both of them.  ""SOTS"" has  some of the most earsplitting, bonecrunching riffs ever recorded  just  listen to that opening ten seconds of the title track! It starts off with a  fasterthanhell Slayeresque riff, pauses for two beats, then once you  hear ""GO,"" you would better be holding onto your head with both  hands, or expect to have it fly off from the burst of energy you are about  to get hit with.  Oh, and did I mention this is the way almost all the  songs are on this album.  ""Suicide Nation,"" ""Blinded By  Fear,"" and ""Nausea"" are my personal favorites besides the  title track, but honestly, every track is excellent.
In short, if  you are a metal fan and you do not have this album, you are missing a lot. I  know a lot of reviews on amazon are just for the sole purpose of telling  readers how great an album is, but honestly, THIS is one that is worth the  money.

7736,"I have been enjoying the delicious mellow flavor of Eight Of The Clock Whole Bean Colombian coffee for years. Accordingly I do not normally right a review every time I order it but I was compelled by what seems to me to be a noticeable improvement in the packaging of this coffee. I ordered two packs of this 40 ounce package and they were delivered to me today. So, they have changed the color of the packaging from primarily brown to primarily white. But most importantly, the two bags I got were vacuum packed tighter than I have ever experienced before. This will undoubtedly assure that when I open that second bag a few weeks down the road, it will be every bit as fresh tasting as the first package that will be opened in about a week from now.

It is always nice, because it is rare, to make a good thing better. Kudos to Eight Of The Clock for the most excellent vacuum sealing of your product.

7747,"I first purchased ""Mythical Kings and Iguanas"" in 1971 when it was first issued on the MediArts label. The only thing I knew about Dory, was that she was, or had been married to Andre Previn, and that she had written the lyrics to ""Valley of the Dolls"". With that, and the fact that I liked the look of the cover of the album, I purchased it! I never, in all my life, was more fascinated with an album than this one. And as of today, it remains probably, my favorite album of all time. She is a master story teller, with bruding, dark , haunting lyrics. Her images are so intense, you can not only visualize them, you can smell and taste them. Her statement on basic human conditions and emotions border on neurotic I love writers like that, and yet you empathize with her. All tracks are amazing, but ""Her Mothers Daughter"", in my opinion is the stand out. It will send chills down your spin, it is so hauting and scary. Dory is probably the most prolific female songwriter of the '60's and '70's, and yet not widly recognized at all. I was so wild about this album, I forced all my friends th hear it, they went out and purchased it, also. I went through 4 copies of this album, and my last copy is badly used. I think I was the only person, along with my friends, who actual bought his on vinyl way back when. To hear it on CD is a joy, no cracks, scratches, and most of all,the quality is remarkable.

Another is to lock the access to my surfboard locker. A third is to lock my wife's bike to the bike rack in the underground parking garage. They are very good within certain limits. At first, these locks are great. For about 5 years they worked flawlessly. I like the large numbers and the raised bumps on the dials, which allow you to open the lock even with almost no light. Problem 1: Suddenly, you will find that the lock is very hard to shut, or very hard to open. You have everything lined up OK, but for some reason the hasp just will not go in or come out. If this happens even once, throw the lock away and start using a new one. Otherwise you may end up like other users and find your stuff locked in, locked out, locked to a tree, etc. I tried spraying some silicone into the lock and this solved the problem for a timebut when the problem recurred, I very nearly could not get the lock open at all. This happened only with the locks that were used outdoors and/or near the beach. Problem 2: Over time in severe direct sunlight such as in the tropics or at high altitudes the plastic dials will degrade. When this happens, a sharp blow with anything hard or a drop onto concrete will break the degraded plastic dial. This takes 45 years or so. Again, it only happens outdoors.

7773,"Children Moving is about the individual creating skills and learning to control their bodies.  Exercises to increase skills used in playing sports are abundant, although time is not devoted to the actual playing of these games during class.  The thought is that by playing the game in P.E. most of the children are missing out on valuable time to practice and learn new skills.  Teachers are encouraged to suggest to the child who wants to play a game that recess or after school or the weekends are perfect times to play the games that use the skills they have been learning.  The book also contains sample curricula for the teacher, depending on the skills of the students and the time available for Physical Education.
My interest in this book grew out of a need for physical education for my homeschooled children.  We have always been an active family, but I wanted to have some exercises and activities that we could do on a daily basis.  Being active everyday helps children be able to focus more and use up the excess energy that they always seem to have.  I leave equipment out all day long so the kids can participate in the activity on their own as time permits.  There are many activities that can be completed in your backyard, or inside your home depending on the space you have available.  I look for those during the colder months.  We also have access to gym space which has most of the equipment and space that we need for certain activities.  I enjoy this approach to skill building and keeping children active.  It is a far cry from what I experience in physical education in the public school system, and that is a very good thing.",Enjoyable Activities.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but need to include more rods in the kit,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

7805,"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System We Have been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 45 months and clean the flexible duct that is routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes did not dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, I should be doing this if that is all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. You Have got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or did not read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or did not use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cannot come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. That Is simple physics they simply cannot come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high,",This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System We Have been paying $75 per visit...,5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I was suprised about earlier reviewers who thought that this is a drawback, I have to remind you that original Helloween was a happy power metal band in the 80's .
Andi puts his best vocal effort here. My favirote song is ""Do You Feel Good"" , other great songs are ""Liar"", ""Listen To The Flies"", ""Never Be a Star"", ""Just a Little Sign"",""Do not Stop Being Crazy"".
 The album is verstle and diverse , you have the great original power metal Helloween sound in songs like ""Do You Feel Good"",""Liar"",""Juat a Little Sign"", ""Listen To The Flies"" and a heavy metal sound in ""Never Be A Star"", slow heavy metal in ""Do not Stop Being Crazy"" which both have great lyrics , all the songs are great , the only that I could not get into is ""Back Against The Wall"" which sounds a track from their earlier era whith Andi in the 90's.

7816,"Picture: Not bad at all considering.

Audio: That is another story. The first thing I noticed was the back of the box, where it says that the 5.1 surround mix was created from the original 2 track mix. Now, how do you make 5 tracks from 2? The stereo mix, through my trusty EV speakers was not very good. Hardly any bass. Clapton's guitar was almost inaudible on some songs, and cutting in and out on others. If you listen to the remastered CD of this show, ""Live Peace In Toronto"", it sounds incredible. Another reason it sounds better is that they had the good sense to turn off Yoko's wailing vocal track on the Lennon songs. Her 20 some minute solo routine is one thing, it may be your cup of tea or not although at one point, I swear, John grabs her from behind near the end of her performance and says 'stop'you can hear it! but she should not be tunelessly screeching during the rock and roll numbers. Anyway, what they should have done here is to go back to the original multitrack tapes and sync them to the film and do a proper surround sound mix. The only extra here is a short bit at the 1988 London gallery opening of John's artwork, where Yoko tells the bynowfamiliar story of how the Plastic Ono Band got it is name.

This is history, and still worth a look, but I am tired of these lazy DVD releases that do not live up to the potential of modern video technology.",Sound: Not bad at all considering. Audio,Could Be Sweeter

For anyone remotely fascinated by the movie even if you are not an avid reader, the Bret Easton Ellis book will cut you to pieces  pardon the pun.

Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry Home Edition crashed frequently especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words. Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive addon software and hardware. True enough, the builtin firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.

I spent a bit one evening that my husband worked late reading and a little time the next day and that was that! I enjoyed this book so much because it was a romantic drama with some lightheartedness to it. And it was such an easy breezy read.

Quick side note, I was also excited because the author lives in Louisiana which is where I was born and raised! This book shares the story of Kat and Lucas in their separate struggles to get past friendship into a dating relationship. Each of them has feelings stronger that a friendship towards the other but cannot find the way to bridge that gap. I especially love the story because I feel like that is true of many people today.

The main character of the novel, Bethany Quinn struggles with her imperfect childhood and the memories that come with it, changes in her present and what the future might hold.  Thinking she has it all together in her professional life, she has to deal with all the suppressed emotions of her past when her grandfather is ill and then dies, leaving her 500 acres of farmland.

7865,"The Platinum Edition of ""Cinderella"" is another excellent job by Disney of restoring one of the early classics and releasing it on DVD. This is a 2 DVD package, with the first DVD containing the 1950 movie in its original format which in this case is the same as a standard TV, a feature from ESPN on ""Cinderella"" stories, and a couple of music videos and a making of a music video feature. The second DVD is simply packed with extras, including a making of feature; a ""Cinderella"" that almost was feature; deleted scenes; a feature on Disney's nine old men the animators for many of Disney's classics; another feature on Mary Blair; excerpts from shows at the time which featured ""Cinderella"" such as Perry Como and the Mickey Mouse Club; and much more. The most interesting parts for me were learning how this movie played a significant role in keeping Disney from closing, and the different storylines they had for Cinderella that they dropped in favor of the movie we now know. The movie itself is the important piece though, and this is a very good Disney movie, but I do not think it is their best. The weaknesses of the film to me are: the ball where nobody dances except the prince and Cinderella; The Prince's character is never fully developed, and what little we do see makes him appear rude yawning at the introductions to guests and walking away from them; and lastly the inability of the Stepmother to recognize Cinderella at the ball. The last one is not believable because they chose to keep Cinderella very clean and beautiful in her ordinary life, and so the transformation in no way makes her unrecognizable. The strengths of the movie far outweigh these weaknesses though. The Stepmother is","Great movie, but not their best",The Movie Which Saved Disney

7886,"I have been a fan of ""Where is Waldo"" ever since, my mom bought and brought home the first two books in the series ""Where is Waldo"" and ""Where is Waldo Now"" for me in 1987 and 1988. They were such fun books to look for the elusive traveler in every scenein town,on the beach,railway station,the museum,and going back in time in ""Where is Waldo Now."". I would usually get a chance to look at them after doing my homework, or coming in from being outside during the summer. It was a relaxing relief to have these wonderful books to look forward to. I immediately got hooked from the first scene of ""Where is Waldo"", to finding him, the checklist at the end of each book to find, and to journey with Waldo wherever he would end up next. These books are so wonderful and captivating that I strayed away from t.v. and video games...it made me want more of the Waldo books. I was a fan from then and never looked back from being a fan. The ""Where is Waldo"" books along with countless other booksShel Silverstein, fairy tales, Alice in Wonderland etc... drove my passion for books and reading through the roof. I was then happy to discover more Waldo books were coming out, and I got those right away when they first came out. I saw this version of the first five ""Where is Waldo"" books combined, and it was such a relief, because I would not want to carry all of my Waldo books in larger former, when being out and about! I love how it has a strap to hold the book closed when you are not looking for Waldo, the quote from Martin Handford on the fron flap, the Waldo greeting and opening all","'Where is Waldo"" the best!","""Where's Waldo"" one of my favorite series from childhood and forever."

it is soft.. flowing.. and relaxing..  if you are an r.e.m. fan.. i think you will enjoy this.. unless the version of r.e.m. you like.. is the one that crafted ""monster"".. if you are looking for a roaring, raging rock cd.. this is not it..

7901,"I really want to give this headset 5/5 but Logitech has had pressing design issues in their headsets for so long that I am starting to question why no one on their team has shared the same concern. Where the head band meets the ear cups, there is a small joint in between. This is basically made an extremely weak plastic and if that inside pops off, the ear cup for that side will never sit comfortably on your ear again. In fact, it will dangle down. There really is no way to make any kind of home solution to restore it back to feeling as it did after that point. The joints are so weak, in fact, that just picking it up the wrong way could cause the weight to break the inside part of the joint.

However, when this headset is not being dragged down by this consistently bad design choice, the headset is one of the most comfortable and best sounding I have used. It is actually incredible the quality and feeling you get for the price but when you realize the joints are as bad as they are, you almost feel bad that they could not be more well constructed since that would make Logitech headsets my go to brand. While their newest Prodigy sets look to have possibly fixed this issue, I still see those also have a joint. Whether it is still made a cheap and weak plastic, I cannot say.

I seriously urge you, Logitech, if you insist on continuing to add these joint pieces between the headband and ear cups, at least make them a strong and durable material  your headsets would be my goto once again.",Logitech headsets do not have any problem,Incredible feeling and sound quality but falls flat due Logitech's constant design choice of weak joints above the ear cups

Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs. Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or ""Features"" as they are called by the company. Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better. Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never let us you do anything. You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus. Do not get me wrong.

7913,"This book probably should have been a New Yorker magazine article.  It is not necessary to discuss every salt mine and brine well in Europe to make a point. The author fills the pages telling aspects of the story of salt in a disconnected manner.  By shifting from place to place and back and forth in time, whatever historical theme the author was trying to present is hopelessly lost.  Here is' what emerges from this book:  Salt used to be scarce and was a key commodity in world trade because of its value as a nutrient and in preservation of meat.  Now it is abundant and not as important to the global economy.

The writing is haphazard; as other reviewers note, the science is bad; and, interesting anecdotes are not woven together to make a real point.",Good in terms of nutritional value and preservation.,Could have been much better

7925,"I do not really know why, but I was hesitant to buy this album  maybe it was some of the reviews. I have always been a huge Blackmore fan, he is my favorite guitarist and this album really does not dissappoint. Now; is this ""Rising""no, is it ""Bent Out Of Shape""no. What it does sound like is a mix of music from the Dio yearsWolf To The Moon and the JLT yearsToo Late For Tears. Blackmore's playing is excellent  as always, however I was dissappointed that there was no instrumental as these are often my favorite moments on any Rainbow album.

Vocalist Doogie White does a good job handling things, he is not Dio or JLT but he does not have to be. It is strange but Rainbow and vocalists is like UFO and guitarists, everyone has their favorite and seems to dump on the others. Blackmore has made some great music with every singer he has ever worked with and that continues here. Also, the beginnings of Blackmore's Night are here with Candice Night cowriting four songs.

Song Highlights include: Cold Hearted Woman, Stand And Fight, Ariel, Black Masquerade, Hall Of The Mountain King and the rerecording of Still I am Sad.

It is a little less useful to me as an investor in technology stocks, but it does offer me that broader perspective on technology that helps put investable ideas into context.

What I did not like about this product:
 The smart cover is not as secure I hoped to be when comparing to the ipad smart cover. More magnets or stronger magnets would make this product better. I do not want to worry about having it accidentally turn on. Of course you can turn off the feature.

 There are number stickers on the inside and if you do take them off it leaves a sticky residue. Note to manufacturer: put the sticker where if you peel it off would not damage or alter the product such as the outside of the case.

He is not even close being back on his game at all.  I remember being a huge fan of his for many years.  I did not think about checking to see how this was before buying it.

That was my mistake as I do not feel that fire that he is had on previous releases at all.  The songs just seem to go from one to another without much feeling or energy at least not to me.  I did like 3 or 4 of the songs like:
""Respect My Conglomerate"" w/Lil Wayne  Jadakiss
""Shoot For The Moon""
""Hustler's Anthem '09"" w/TPain
""Decision"" w/Mary J Blige, Jamie Foxx, John Legend  Common

Those were the only ones that I am feeling and would listen to Busta's latest release.  I am still a fan without a doubt.  But i just hope that next time around he comes with the fire, drive and lyrics that we are used to.  Because he is talented without question but this time around.  I cannot in good conscience give this anything better than 2 stars.

For the most part, the transfer looks great, the effects still stand out and sometimes even look better than the cgi garbage being thrown at us these days. The bad news is the scenes with the flickering television looks all muddy and murky, one of the disadvantages of HD. The dvd release never had this problem before. Because of the HD transfer we get a lot of digital noise that really makes you wish for an analog television,  it is that bad! As for the extras I was a bit disappointed that there was not any cast or crew interviews upon the making of this film. What we do get is a run of the mill documentary about paranormal experiences,  something that would have been okay had there been as I said earlier of the cast and crew. For about 80 percent of the film the transfer looks amazing, but buyer beware when the ""snowy"" and flickering scenes arrive, otherwise a pleasant viewing experience.",Requires a review of the HD transfer,Digital Noise from the Other Side?

The Archos Wifi, iRiver, and iPoodo notTouch will not expand w/ SD cards, so are eliminated says the applephobe. Battery life also sucked. The Cowon D2 was a sure winner at first, but what sold me about the Zen was the ability to read m3u's and make playlists. Navigating 16 gigs of music will be nearly impossible without this. In addition superior bookmarking capabilities and the ability to navigate 2hour long audiobooks sold me on the Zen. It was hard to turn down Cowon's OGGFLACAPE capabilities, it is WMA voice recording, and it is TVout port. They both have amazing sound quality. The Sansa View had the advantage of durability, integration of SD mini card files into regular interface, and great customer service from Sandisk. I had an e280 before and the interface, which is virtually the same, is very basic; only allowing you to choose by Album, Artist, Genre and so on.

During certain times of the year the dog takes to running away: he jumps fences, wiggles out of collars, harnesses and off leashes, he pushes through legs and hands whenever the front door is opened .. and just bolts. Not one of us can figure out where he is so intent on going he has lived in the same house since he was 8 weeks and 1 day old, there is always plentiful food and water and love, and my friend makes sure he gets daily exercise. The last time Banshee bolted it took over a week for him to be found, quite a ways from home, and he was really rough looking. My friend and his wife were considering rehoming Banshee, they had made the decision that they would rather have the heartbreak of not living with him over the heartbreak of him being hit by a car. I was able to purchase the Hot Spot Wireless LED Collar at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and I offered it to my friend as a last ditch effort at keeping Banshee home safe with his family. I was able to give the Hot Spot collar to my friend on September 15th. Today, October 3rd, I stopped over to see how the family was doing. I rang the doorbell and when my friend opened the door for me my heart fell.

8029,"I bought this for one reason and one reason only: the hope that iMovie had been fixed from the 2008 version to be more like the 2006 version. Did not happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I have tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out thinking they have got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply do not exist. IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files! I honestly think they do not want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you do not need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason. iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it does not. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together I guess there is a little family resemblance there. The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you are probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually next 23 years as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you",iMovie is better than ever.

The material is thick  much thicker than I expected for the price. The stitching is well done. The padding is sufficient enough for my needs. The zippers are strong and should last anyone who uses patience and care when opening and closing the bags.

Yeah, these bags are not going to protect your drums when the van door swings open and they spill out on the road while you speed down the highway doing 80 MPH trying to make it to the gig on time, but they will protect them from getting scratched up while you move them around.

8040,"OK, first, a caveat  though I am a Philly girl, my husband's family is from Bawlmuhr, so I have heard a lot about this author and have more than a passing knowledge of the local flavor. I think that probably added to my enjoyment of the book. Additionally, I could see where someone who does not know the Baltimore area might lose a bit of the book.

That being said, the story line of the thriller is quite a new one  for me. I am not a huge reader of the crime fiction genre, but sisters disappearing and one reappearing 30 years later? I wanted to know very early on how this panned out.

The twists and turns of this book did keep me hooked, and I really enjoyed the denouement. The plot did hold up to expectation.

There were some drawbacks to the book, though. I found the long backtracks into the side characters the parents, the detectives rather uninforming and, mostly, not interesting. I ended up skimming or skipping a bit here and there just to keep to the main plot. Some of those bits were rather large. And yet, I do not feel if I missed much. That is not really a good sign.

Over all, a very good premise and a mostly good read, with in my opinion a little too much filler.

Although I am given the options to ""continue program"" or ""close program"" the program does not respond to clicks on either option.

8068,"National Geographic is one of the best magazines of its kind, with plenty of great photography, thoughtful articles, and diverse coverage of several different topics relating to the planet earth. Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.

What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.

8071,"My pooch Niki has been on a prescription diet food off and on for a while, so I have researched some of the low calorie foods out there. I like how Iams lists the calories for their foods on their website. At 336 calories/cup, this is not especially low. My pooch Niki's prescription Hill's lowcalorie food is 244 calories/cup, and there are a few nonprescription foods in the upper 200s such asnbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/BacktoBasicsGrainFreeDryDogFoodLambandPotatoRecipe/dp/B00C9XLPAA/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Back to Basics GrainFree Dry Dog Food, Lamb and Potato Recipe/anbsp;at 297 which she also really likes. So, this is not quite as good for weight loss as some, but it is not energypacked like a lot of foods that are in the 400500 calories/cup range. It is a pretty good choice if your dog is not overly active and does not need a lot of calories, or could stand to lose a little weight. No, chicken is not the main ingredient but I am okay with that. The point of lower calorie foods is to provide your dog with bulk without all of the calories, so they feel full but can still lose weight. I pay the extra money for the Hill's food because it offers the lowest calorie/cup that I have seen, and Niki likes it. The Back to Basics is a really good nonprescription choice, I AM GOING TO, with meat being the main ingredient...and it still has over 10 fewer calories than this food but it is crazy expensive on Amazon, so maybe look for it locally. So, if you can get a good price on the Back to Basics, I recommend it over this variety. Where Iams tends to win not always, but normally is price. The Hill's is about $3/lb and Back to Basics is close to that on Amazon,",The Lowes is like a regular low-calorie diet,"Not low calorie, but lower than a lot of foods"

8087,"Earthquake was 1974's other big disaster movie, but despite the big budget and the `allstar' cast it is dated much worse than The Towering Inferno. Part of the problem is the soap operatics in the foreground, with Charlton Heston torn between neurotic wife Ava Gardner and his young mistress Genevieve Bujold taking centrestage among various minor daytime soap subplots courtesy of writer Mario Puzo. Rather than making you care about the fate of the characters, they just leave you impatient for the quake to finally hit LA, but once it does there is not much focus to the destruction: whereas the S.S. Poseidon and the Glass Tower confined their characters in one perilous structure to add a sense of claustrophobia and tension, here the cast are spread all across the city when the aftershocks that because the real damage and start depleting the cast arrive. This would not be too much of a problem if the film had any real sense of scale to it, but despite the allstar cast and the big budget, it has the feel of a backlot movie rather than being shot on location. The film has the flat 70s TVmovie version lighting and photography that was a feature of most 70s Universal films, which just adds an extra helping of cheese to the proceedings. Even John Williams' score feels at times like a lounge music variation on his work on The Towering Inferno, as if the whole film was put together with whatever was lying around the studio. The result is watchable enough if you are in an undemanding mood, but resolutely unmemorable. Of the supporting cast, George Kennedy's cop fares best while Lloyd Nolan comes off worst, all but fluffing his lines as if he would only been given the script seconds before the",Very nice film,A less  than  earthshattering release

8103,"This is a freaking confusing story.

I understand overwhelming sexual attraction where all you want to do is have mad sex with someone. There is chemistry that strong. And the main character is 21 and the Prince in the title is 28 who should freaking know better and about one of the most abusive people I have ever read in a romance who was not actually into BDSM  not that BDSM is abusive. I have had a mentally abusive boyfriend and this what it is like; he runs hot, he runs cold, he keeps you wanting him more because he can. Those few moments or hours where he is nice make you feel incredibly special, and then he flips it around and makes you feel like crap. That is this Prince to a ""t"".

While we are lead into a trip into the Prince's mind...he is beyond irrational which is the point?. And cruel. And the setup for the next two books? Jeez Louise. I cannot evince any sympathy for a guy like this. All he wants is to ""get over"" her. Yet, keeps lying and digging them both deeper into a fake relationship.

This game gives you abilities that is loved in many games combined. On top of that, it does it very well. What is bad besides no campaign? The AI is really dumb and slow. However on a counterpoint, the AI is not meant to great affect your multiplayer experience. The AI is used as dummy to boost your speed of getting a Titanfall. It is meant as an extra element of strategy to the game. If the AI was good, I would have a lot of trouble getting across the map because there is a lot of them and they deploy in squads. There is really not much complaints from me besides it needs more content. There is really only 3 Titan chassis and a handful of weapons. There is not much upgrades for them either.

8169,"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and Book We said Hello to Club Sin way back in book 1, with Dmitri and Presely Claimed and now? We have to say goodbye, with a beautiful story about this same couple. While I am not Thrilled with Stacey Kennedy for closing this series but you know, I must have missed her call when she wanted to ask my opinion I understand that there must always be a time to say goodbye. Hopefully with the new spin off series, we will get a few visits with the Club Sin Crew. Presley Flynn had searched hard to find the perfect man, never really dreaming that she would. And if she did, no way did she think it would be the owner of a BDSM club. But she did and he was. Rich, handsome and into kink, it does not get any better than that. Life is good but Presley is seeing a pattern, each of her Club Sin friends have found their Masters, love and for most even marriage. For Presley, not so much. And now, there is a problem at the club and Dmitri is freezing her out. Not sharing his struggles. This is so not how Presley sees their relationship going. They had a partnership, did not they? Finally, Dmitri Pratt has it all. The club he created in honor of his mentor, a successful business and the woman of his dreams. He has waiting to ask her to marry him until she is confident in their relationship. Not wanting to rush her he has no idea that this is slowly killing her and them.

8170,"I got the online version last year and this year, the quickbook for mac.  I have never used the PC version.  I thought the online version had many more features, was more user friendly and just easier to navigate.  It seemed, for instance, that it was easier to preview statements and invoices online before sending them.  With this version, it is extremely challenging to do this very basic taskwhich frustrates me and makes me want to just scrape the whole thing.  It is extremely frustrating and feels as if Quickbooks for macs is treated like a second hand, afterthought product.  If there is anyone out there reading this that is happy with an accounting software, please make a comment and tell me what you are using.  I just want a basic accounting program from my business.  Quickbooks, overall, is too sophisticated fro me and yet, cannot do the basic things i need with ease.

8178,"I am not exactly unbiased, here; I absolutely loved Age of Empires.  The moment I got word that AoE2 was in the works, I knew I would buy it.  AoE had so many great aspects; realworld history, great graphics, intelligent  interface and build systems and excelent and varied resource gathering.  Everything you want in an RTS.  Their best achievement, though, was the  random map feature... endless replayability.
Of course, AoE had it is  faults: bad AI pathfinding, not enough distinction between the different  cultures every culture had the same vocal cues, BIG nono, some  others.
AoE2: the Age of Kings is a wonderful sequel for many reasons,  the most significant being gameplay. Military units now have the  desperately needed behavior and formation commands, making combat  infinitely more interesting and fun.  Garissoning units allows for better  protection of your peasants and better defense of your hometown, as well  as allowing for ambushes.  Farming is now more realistic, with farms that  roll over any terrain and that are renewable at a click.  Plus all the  great multiplayer customization is back, with many splendid additions.  Perhaps best of all, the military units are exquisitely balanced against  each other, with each society having a unique unit that allows for varied  and exciting combat.
While gameplay should be the number one concern of  any developer, the graphics while beautiful are the same as they ever  were.  However, keep in mind that beautiful graphics cannot mask an  uninteresting or unoriginal game Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, Unreal,  Quake 3 Arena.  Great gameplay will always shine through mediocre or  outdated graphics Starcraft, Caesar 3, Prince of Persia.

8201,"I never had a problem learning the english language or acquiring new vocabulary. Why then did I have a mental block learning a new language? Could it be the boring, repetition and grammer ? yup! I am very pleased to report that I now can converse in elemantary German thanks to the Rosetta Stone learning system. Imagine learning can be fun! The total immersion approach teaches you a new language the same way you learned your first one through visual and contextural clues, repetition and a very cool speech analyzer that helps with pronunciation. The Rosetta stone approach is the best thing next to a personal tutor since it is so comprehensive long time to download , probably because of server traffic. I must admit, it took a while to build my confidence. It has been a long time since the rigors of a college classroom. At middle age, was not it supposed to be a bit harder for me to learn? What I found, is that the mind is like any muscle. With work, your can grow more nimble and strong. The self pacing aspect of the program, makes it easier to remain positive and focused on progress and not worry about ""falling behind"". I am really enjoying the challenge of learning a new language. I look forward to adding other languages. The software is of excellent quality. I find the photography outstanding and the voices attractive. It might sound silly to remark about this, but the user experience is intoxicatingly fun. The big question, ""Is it worth it?"" For me, it is a definite ""Yes"". Although the software is a high price, it is by far the best ""learning experience"". Since you want to learn a language, why not put the cost into perspective?

8202,"I read this book for Kyles Fiction Addiction and gave it five stars. This book is a wonderful story rich in history and romance set in the small town of BlackBrook, New York. The authors creative way of weaving the past and future of three sisters, Kara Kenna and Trina, had me spell bound. It seems the author did her homework for this story. Her story was filled with snippets that enriched the plot as well as show cased her extensive knowledge of Wiccan Rituals, Massachusetts and upstate New York. This epic tale with its twisting plot flows between the past and future seamlessly. The characters are so well rounded and real you cannot help but fall in love with them and want to see who they really are and how their lives will unfold. The literal sparks between the main character Trina and Office Hardy makes their stories magical from the moment they meet. This book is a great read. It is creative and had me guessing to the end. I found myself routing for these characters as they battled their inner and outer demons. I love that the characters were empowered strong woman. I also liked that the heroine and hero are not a sappy couple making googoo eyes at each other throughout the whole book, but they do a lot of flirting and deeper emotions are at play between the leading man and the leading lady in this very romantic love story.

I did not use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the rightangles at the end of the run. I still did not want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I would try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I am really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand no pliers and did not use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand too lazy to hook the drill up.

The addition of a centering bit for 1/2"" and 1/4"" shanks is nice to have. Also the amount of threads and their quality is vastly superior on this set so it should tighten better and not work loose like the other set. As on the other set, the ID and OD are not machined to the correct sizes but they are closer to the correct size and more consistent. The other set had some oversize and some undersize while for this set they are all slightly undersize for the OD most about 0.003"" and all but one oversize for the ID which is not really important.

8226,"I would first like to remark that this game is obviously inspired in many, many ways by A Link to the Past. Even the new world is directly inspired by A Link to the Pasts Dark World. Thus I cannot recognize every part of this game as its own genius. That said though, this game is not only extremely enjoyable, but probably contains one of the best game worlds to explore that I have seen since Ocarina of Time or perhaps the Wind Waker. What makes it so golden is that the game feels fresh in almost every way. You never for a second mind the fact that you are treading old territory. In fact, it is a brilliant combination of feeling brand new, but stirringly familiar. This is a perfect stand alone title and a new standard for remakes. Despite what a great time I almost always had with the title, I will now proceed to criticize it. I would like to say that I found out about the cuccu game prize outside of the actual game itself. Also none of the dungeons were badly designed, but while some were very memorable, others were easy to forget. Cons: The dungeons all felt a little short One or two dungeons were a little soso for me The cuccu games ultimate prize is ridiculously hard to get. Perhaps, just perhaps, you could have changed the geography of Lorule a little more? The game is not quite perfect. Just imagine this 10x better and your head would probably burst. Easy game?

8261,"This was such an easy book to get into. First of all, the setting timewise location seem really well thought out. The characters were even better. From the very beginning I was trying my hardest to picture everyone in my mind...and at first it was a little difficult, but what I REALLY found that was portrayed well was their personalities. At the first Banquet scene, I could see Cassia's beautiful green dress like it was a scene from a movie I was watching. It would be obvious to say that I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It is especially funny to add that since Sash I have a Love Triangles button at the top of our page now, Sash would not tell me who is ""Team"" she was on until I had decided who I had chosen...and let me tell you...it was definitely not the same guy. As soon as the text, ""Team Ky!"" left my fingertips...I knew...Uh Oh...our first disagreement so far! And that was EXCITING because it shows how differently people perceive the characters. So here is how it turned out...I chose Ky, obviously Sash chose Xander...but why? Well, first of all...we got into a playfully heated discussion about how I always love the dangerous, forbidden, naughty boy...while SHE on the other hand, pretty much ALWAYS gives the ""best guy friend"" character her vote. I am pretty sure it is because he is safe she feels bad for him...and because he is ""oh, so sweet"" and all that mushy stuff. But honestly, Ky is definitely the one for her as far as I am concerned and the fact that he is labeled an Aberration makes me irate.

Based on others I have tested, I do not think you will find many higher QPR quality price ratio headphones on the market. After my initial unboxing and testing, here are my impressions: Packaging Ugh! I HATE blisterpacked electronics, and unfortunately these come packaged in one of those $^ plastic packages for retail shelves that require a pocket knife to open. And while opening it, be careful you do not injure yourself on the sharp plastic edges that you will expose while cutting it open! Construction Quality Compared to the details present on the Apple headphones that come with an iPhone I will be comparing them directly for this review, you can clearly see why these are less expensive. The construction is allplastic the iPhone headphones include ""softtouch"" materials on the earbuds and also metal screen grills over the speakers. However the cords are rubberjacketed which gives them the feel of slightly better quality. One thing I noticed is that the cord retains a ""coil spring"" shape after unboxing that is pretty annoying in other words, it wants to retain the shape it was wrapped in while packaged, causing it to want to tangle if there is any slack. After several weeks of use, they are still stiff and springy probably due mostly to the plastic jacketing on the cords. Price For $8 there is very little to complain about with these headphones. In fact, the price is nothing short of astonishing given the quality of sound compared to the iPhone headphones. I have bought plenty of cheap earbuds and very few include a microphone and pause/answer button like these do. Sound Quality As mentioned above,",Good Quality!,Surprisingly good quality sound considering the price - a decent replacement for Apple earbuds

TIP2: Pictures on my website show you how it looks and works AND a scan of the old packagethat featured a howto picture! BackgrounTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry I bought this chuck key holder because I bought a special ""close quarters"" 90 degree drill for working in tight spaces like under a shelf on harbor frieght. I was worried about loosing or misplacing the key which would make the drill useless. The key was also a nonstandard size making it hard to replace. Keyless chucks are great but traditional keyed chucks do not let the drill bit slip in the chuck but the key can get lost. Thus the universal key holder. PROS: Works with most drills/keys up to about 3/8"" chuck, not 1/2"" unless the key shaft is thin enough. CONS: It is very easy to split the rubber making it useless and will likely need modifications to improve it. In my comment on the first review you can see the picture scanned from the original package and I wrote a step by step how to install. Extra tools / parts: 1.

This is a game you could literally play for years. First off, your character. You could literally spend an hour or more tweaking your character to fit your playing needs. There are numerous races, each with their own look, feel, strengths and weaknesses. You can be male or female. You have a TRILLION options to customize the eyes, hair, cheekbones, ears, skin tone, age, nose, chin, you name it. I doubt that any two players could come up with the exact same character if they tried. It is quite impressive, and it really helps you to relate to your character. You are thrown immediately into the story. You are in a jail cell, but are allowed to escape because of political intrigue. You spend the first few hours of the game in the dark cellars beneath the castle, learning how to fight rats and other smaller critters. Soon, though, you are launched into the outer world, and what a world it is! This is truly a spectacular experience, especially if you have a large, high definition TV. The world is ""real"" there are tons of places to go, people to interact with, sunsets to watch, forests to wander through. All characters have their own schedules, their own lives. What you choose to do is completely up to you. Join up with the soldiers or join the mage group. Become an assassin or carve a path completely of your own. The world you are in feels ""real"".

I have bought a few more games, and was actually first introduced to the Wii by my daughter's American Idol game.

8361,I purchased this ladder to pair up with an all aluminum Gorilla 2ft ladder I already own in order to build a platform to span between them so that I can have something stable to stand on while trimming in my ceilings when I am painting. Previously I used an old coffee table to stand on and it was so comfortable to work on and I could cover more area before having to get down and move the table but the table it heavy and I need a little help to move and position. I can move the two ladders and platform alone. Anyway I have compared the two ladders side by side and I like the construction of this ladder a lot more. The top step of this ladder is also a tad bigger so if you ever need to stand on the very top you will feel more secure. I would buy this ladder again. I will be in the market for an 8ft ladder soon and I will most likely purchase this brand.,Best ladder I've ever bought,Great ladder!

8369,"This test is fairly easy to use and understand. You pee into a cup and dip the end of the strip in it for 10 seconds. After you wait 5 minutes you check the test. The line that tells you the test worked always showed up very dark. The line that tells you if your positive or negative is not.

I do not like that the line for positive or negative was either invisible or barely visible. I took the tests every week for months and could not see any difference in the positive or negative line. The first 6 weeks I saw nothing. After that I started to see a bit of red on the right side of the line. According to the test anything means you are negative, but this test is not very reassuring. This test should have a better and more visible reading.

If you have a test that will decide your employment or your freedom I would not trust this test. Not using for months is the only way that I know I am clean and this test did not help me at all. The main reason I bought this test was to have some idea of when I would be clean to find new employment. It told me nothing and I still had to wait it out and let time take it is course.

We have three computers: 1 HP Pavilion Slimline desktop PC mine; 2 HP Pavilion Entertainment notebook PC my husband's; and 3 Dell Inspiron notebook PC backup/auxiliary. All three run Windows 7 Home Premium with Internet Explorer 9; the HPs had Kaspersky and the Dell had McAfee for virus protection. Installation was fairly easy on the two computers running Kaspersky. On the HP laptop, it mostly installed except for the malware/antivirus program, which it would not load until Kaspersky was disabled. For my HP desktop, FixIt loaded everything. For the Dell PC running McAfee, we ended up uninstalling McAfee and installing Kaspersky first. We did try to install FixIt with McAfee disabled but still ran into problems, i.e., we simply could not install FixIt at all with McAfee. We were going to take McAfee off the Dell anyway. Once we had Kaspersky loaded onto the Dell, it still took three hours to load FixIt because we kept getting error messages saying that the program had stopped functioning. I was not unfamiliar with this type of performance program, having run TuneUp Utilities for the previous year with no problems whatsoever. FixIt offers most of the same features as TuneUp, including pc analyzer, registry repair, oneclick pc maintenance, program optimizer, and browser acceleration. The file shredding and lost data recovery functions were enhancements over TuneUp. Ironically, FixIt advertises the ability to stop ""frustrating PC crashes."" Well, we did not have any PC crashes before installing FixIt. About three days after installing FixIt, both my computer and my husband's started experiencing the ""blue screen of death.""

""Love never fails"" is a splendid falsettosung piano ballad, while ""Share my life"" is guitarfestooned. ""Human touch"" is a midtempo groove as is the quivering duet with Maurissa Rose ""If it is love"" which calls to mind Al Green.

""A mother's love"" is an almost hymnal piano ode to mothers showcasing his sonorous tenor vocals, with full instrumentation in the final minute and a half. ""You are on my mind"" is Marvin Gayestyle while closing ""Golden days"" is Jazzy with slightly askew beats and a fluid poetic recital by Jill Scott urging one on despite obstacles in life.

This is what I was looking for, bold and wellbalanced flavor, with a chocolate taste that jumped out of the mug. Amazing, even on its own its great. What I cannot tell you is what it would be like with only roasted mate ... however, this blend is about the half the price of pure roasted mated.

However, after some discussion with Tmobile customer service and a visit to the Tmobile office, I discovered that Tmobile had not properly prepared my phone...not Motorola's fault!

My V600's performance has been outstanding. Extremely long standby and talk times. The bluetooth connection works very well. I use mine with a Jabra BT250.

This is my third generation Motorola. After years of Nokia phones, I received a Motorola Timeport as a gift terrible phone with lousy menus. The next year I won a v66 in a raffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size. Motorla had significantly improved the menu from the Timeport, but it still was not the best. The V600's menu has improved on the V66.

The V600's color screen is wonderfully clear and the preloaded ringtones are very nice. I do not really use the camera feature, but the few times that I fooled around with it found that it took decent pictures. Finally, I was concerned about the V600's size until I actually had it in my hand. While it is a little bit bigger than the V66, it is not much bulkier. I still wear it around my neck.

The bottom line is that my wife and I purchase the Tinkyada products almost exclusively when we buy pasta she eats it too despite not having to be gluten free.  And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we cannot find most of their products in our reasonably large city  we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.

As for the product, this is as good as any ""regular"" pasta I ever had in my ""past life.""  There is far less stickiness, and it holds up well for leftovers the next day.  It is not mushy or relatively tasteless like some of the other brands of gluten free pasta we have had in the past.

8426,"I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.

My biggest complaint is that once the ""virus update"" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I could not even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A popup comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.

I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any antivirus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.

Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It does not have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it is a good lowfrills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There is plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25 less expensive.",Well made for any soap.,Great soap - but soapy scent

I have put the lid back on and I can still use it so I am only doing the review on the serum, not the condition of the bottle.  The serum is a gel consistency and goes on very smooth and absorbs well.  There is no oily residue and I put my daily moisturizer over the top of it.  I have noticed that my face holds moisture for longer when I am wearing this, but it is too soon to see if there will be a chance in in wrinkles etc.  Overall I really like the serum and I have used other Vichy products and have enjoyed them over the long run, I do not see this product being any different.","I really like the serum, but just as other reviewers",All day moisture

8438,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Great product!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

8454,"I bought this to go camping. It was very comfortable, kept us off the ground. The foot pump worked very well.  I think that some reviewers who fault the pump may have not been covering the air intake hole well enough when pressing down to force air into the mattress.  I had that problem for the first few pumps, but solved it by just being more deliberate with how I placed my hand it was in the tent, so standing to pump was not a realistic option. over the hole. It fit perfectly into the TMS Waterproof Automatic Outdoor 2 Person Double Layer Instant Camping Family Tent that I also bought on Amazon for the trip.  Fit 2 adults and a toddler on the mattress, very comfortably  it is Queen sized, and then deflated and folded it up, and put it back into the box it came in for next time.

8458,"I had no idea that I needed a setting powder after applying the rest of my makeup until I actually had the chance to review this product. The Dermablend Compact Solid Setting Powder is easy to use even if you do not follow the directions, goes on smoothly without being noticeable, and does what it claims to do. As I had mentioned, I did not follow the directions and I just used the pad that was included in the compact to apply the powder. I patted to apply it. However, I did not buff it off and I still had great results. Due to the fact that I did not generously use the product as instructed, it might not have made a difference if I had buffed the makeup or not. It still kept my makeup looking fresh hours later. Usually, after a couple of hours, my blush is gone and my foundation begins to cake or disappears. This was not the case after using the Dermablend Setting Powder. Now a product that does what it says it does regardless of user error makes it a superior makeup.

I usually use ""EcoTraction ET3RJ AllNatural Volcanic Mineral Ice Traction Granules"" which I love.  The granules are bigger like coffee grounds but a little larger.  They are big enough to stay in place.  No color and they do not break down.  In fact after the storm is over and everything gets back to normal they are still sitting there exactly where I put them waiting to be swept up.  I only tried this because of the reviews and I wondered if it might be more comfortable on paws.  It would be more comfortable but it would also be all over their paws and fur.  I do not want anything ingesting this stuff which would happen if they tried to lick it off.  We had a storm last night and this morning I went out to shovel my steps and saw the red stains from the previous storm the Traction Magic left behind.  The only plus I can see over the other product I mentioned is the ability to pack it directly on your tires if you get stuck.  I have not gotten stuck in snow since college I am 50 so I doubt I will ever be able to confirm that.  Besides I would never keep something so messy and staining in my car even if it is contained.

I picked this set because it seemed to be the best value. When the package came and I opened the box my son was interested in what I had, but when I started taking the toys out of the box and showing them to him he got so excited he was clapping and shaking and laughing. That right there makes it the best purchase to date for him based on his satisfaction. He loves all of the toys and is able to use them all by himself except the drumsticks, which I will supervise him with and I had to show him what they were for. There was no strap or anything although there was a place for one on our drum, so no choking danger there for us. We received 2 castanets which were 2 cute little bugs. He had no problem handling them or playing with them. They also are designed so that your little one will not break a finger if they clap it down on one. The electronic butterfly keyboard 3 buttons, 2 modes single key notes or song played when key pressed is a bit loud but most toys are to me. It came working right out of the box, with batteries included. The maracas are pleasant sounding as a previous reviewer stated. The tambourine is a flower and it makes okay sound.

But now Dream Warriors is excellent. For me this is even creepier than the first two. The story is compelling, the actors are perfectly casted, the musical score is scary. I love Patricia Arquette as Kirsten Parker, Heather Langenkamp as Nancy, Ken Sagoes as Kincaid, Bradley Gregg as Phillip, Jennifer Rubin as Taryn, and of course Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. And although Director Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont are responsible for the new jokey Freddy, they still deliver in it being the scariest Elm street film and Freddy being the cruel Clown.

8479,"""Over Sea Under Stone"" is perhaps the weakest of the classic ""Dark is Rising"" series, though in itself it is quite a good book. In this, Susan Cooper kicks off her epic fantasy sequence with doses of Celtic legend, a good vs. evil battle, and a hunt for a mysterious, magical treasure. Simon, Jane and Barney Drew have arrived at their greatuncle Merriman's seaside house for a vacation and rapidly become quite bored with the seaside village. But when exploring the attic, they unearth a very, very old map that is somehow connected with the legendary King Arthur. As anyone else would do, the kids begin the search to find a golden grail that is somewhere nearby. But they soon find that they are not the only ones who want the map. A seemingly genial pair of vacationers are being slightly too inquisitive, and someone breaks into Merriman's house in search of the map. And Merriman reveals the origins of the map and an agesold conflict between good and evil that hinges on who finds the grail first. Taken alone, ""Over Sea Under Stone"" is a solid, even excellent fantasy story. But it is a little out of sync with the rest of the series. However it sets excellent groundwork, has an intriguing storyline and a good mix of folklore and Arthuriana, and offers us one of the most mysterious and likable ""magic mentors,"" Merriman Lyon. It starts off with every kid's fantasy treasure maps and ancient kings and rapidly blossoms into something much more. One of the most noticeable differences between this and Cooper's later books is the writing; the writing in her later books becomes much more verbose and descriptive and magical. Here it is quite stark and plain, without a great deal of detail or mystical mindblowing.","Great book, good but not bad.",The journey begins

I have used quicken and money varying between products since the inception of both. But I am one of the people who simply wants a place to keep tabs of my checking information. I never used it for investments, for writing checks or bill pay. So for me, I was getting a ton of features in previous versions when I was using Windows thatI never touched, and for me just cluttered up everything. I was happy when they announced the Mac essentials version coming out this year, since I just transitioned from over 20 years of windows use to my first macbook last summer. And while I have windows 7 running in fusion and boot camp, I wanted my financial stuff to be in the same OS as the rest of my personal things... So I ran Ibank for the interim period, and while it suited my needs, it was not able to download from my bank directly, so I was manually marking things as cleared and such by comparing it to my online bank website. Pain. Even in the 2009 version I had in Windows of Quicken, that one also could not directly connect and download my data for me. I had to download the files from my bank and then import them to quicken 2009...

8492,"Small, but handy.  It is really not large enough for more than one sandwich at a time, and not a thick one, either.  The cover has to be locked down to cook and thus the sandwich is really compressed flat.  I do not think it will take two slices of a thick bread or a lot of filling.  It does cook quickly, but I found that half the sandwich browned faster than the other, and so had to turn it around and cook longer to brown it fully.  When you close the lid the sandwich filling tends to slide to the front, since there is no room for expansion.  All in all, this is a small appliance that does well at grilled cheese, regular sliced bread, not a lot of filling, and makes a quick meal.  Easy to clean, just wipe with a damp cloth.

Having used this for a while, I find I do not really like how squashed the sandwiches come out.  They are very flattened and the bread becomes tough.  It is quick and easy to clean, but I am going to buy one with a ""floating"" top so I can make thicker sandwiches.","Small, but handy","Serves the purpose, but if you want thick sandwiches look again."

She runs by and jumps off it to get it moving and she is only 4 months old! She herds it all around the house.

Update:
We have lost all our puppy teeth, and she can scratch into the side of the ball as she is biting and chasing it. She will actually stand on top of the ball, and bite down on it and it will move out from under her.  I just use a razor blade and cut off the longer pieces, but I did not think this would happen!!!! She will have this for years no doubt, but I was truly shocked when she started biting into it and scoring slivers off like cheese in a cheese grater. It is funny how she knows that the bathroom is a dead end street, the kitchen tile moves a lot faster than the carpet, and how the coffee table is something that she can lap over and over again. She will chase the ball into a pine cabinet I made in junior high school, and I am afraid that she is going to split one of the doors in half. It is made out of 1"" pine, but one door does not make noise when the ball hits it, so she has perfect the technique to have it hit the one that does!

8513,"I have loved every game in the Assassin's Creed line from the very first one. The graphics, gameplay, story, historical information, everything is simply stunning. This one is no exception. Even though the Pirate fad dried up a few years ago, this game might just bring it back. Once you get into this, you will not want to let it go. When you start the storyline, you are sort of skeptical, waiting for the cliches, hoping that they do not say, ""why is the rum gone,"" or ""bloody pirates,"" or ""arr matey,"" but even when they do it is well placed and feels right. Besides that, it is basically another of the Templar vs. Assassin plot lines, but with pirates thrown in. Plenty of historical fun facts too. When the beginning of the story ends, and you find yourself more or less free to do as you please, everything gets real, and fast. Your ship can be customized, with sails, figureheads, etc. The open world gameplay means you can finish the story at your own pace. You can transition from piloting your ship to free running on foot and back again WITHOUT a loading screen, and that alone is wonderful. The game controls almost the same as AC3, with the enhanced free running and smoother controls. Above all else, the ships are pure glory. You can freely roam around the caribbean seas, sinking all kinds of ships, destroying forts, and just being a boss. I have never seen a game capture the effect of pirating or even sailing quite like this. Ever seen the sun set on the seas of tortuga? With the graphics and art in this game, you will. Everything has detail, all of the sunsets and harsh storms and little tropical towns have a realistic feel. This",Great product,The Golden Age of Piracy Returns with a Bang

Condemned 2 leaves off where Ethan Thomas slowly becomes insane after trying to figure out all the violent crimes in the city. The game's main attraction is the new combat system. In the first you hit with RT and blocked with LT but now you can control the left and right hand with each trigger and you block by holding them both down. We get a lot more melee weapons such as toilet seats, bowling balls, bowling pins, and even bricks! The game also has more for you to search for in the game such as destroying sonic emitters, finding ""antennas"" which gives you tidbits from the news and ""responses"" which is a given time to hit the A button to respond to certain scenarios. the reason why this cult is making everyone violence. While this adds more depth it is very distracting when you are trying to hear who is stalking you and trying to get sucked into the atmosphere. Speaking of that the game is very very scary. The game also is VERY dark to where you cannot see anything and you have to turn your brightness up, and not to mention the almost useless flashlight. The game's gun play is better this time but is not nearly as satisfying",Really distracting...,"Not as good as the first, but a good enough sequel"
8532,"The year is around 2026, a space station Oberon located in Saturn's orbit encountered an electromagnetic cloud, one of the pilot crash landed on a foreign planet after his pod came in contact with the space phenonmenon, a world where the humans are slave with the apes as rulers.
Mark Wahlberg did a great job as the reluctant hero Leo Davidson, while Tim Roth gave a convincing portrayal the ruthless general Thade.  Surprisingly, some of the most human traits were brought out by Helena Bonham Carter's ape character Ari, with Michael Clarke Duncan as the fearsome warrior Attar.  With the film's main focus on the visuals and action, the character development seemed somewhat lacking and hollow at times.
Unfortunately the story is flawed, with many questions unexplained, and many interesting angles unexplored.  But overall under the imaginative direction of Tim Burton, Planet of the Apes is a visual effect treat that no one should miss.  Packed with nonstop action, there is not a dull moment in this movie.  From the futuristic space station to the savage land where the apes ruled, each set is beautifully and wondefully shot, with a great soundtrack to make the experience even better.  There is a twilight zoneesque feeling from start to finish, leaving just enough room at the end for a possible sequel.  Bottom line, a decent movie that needed to be watched on a big screen, but go to the matinee, you will be glad the few dollars you saved.",A good movie that needs to be watched on a big screen,Very memorable summer blockbuster of 2001

8534,"Up until this film I did not have a very positive view of Barbara Streisand's acting ability. Despite my tendency to hold on to my opinions past their time, I have changed my mind in a dramatic way. This film undeniably proves that Streisand is a very talented actress. Nolte on the other hand has always had great potential, even if it has not been realized in every film he appeared in. No need to worry, in ""The Prince of Tides"" he is tremendous. This wonderful drama contains elements of horror and suspense but its strength comes from the romance that blossoms between the psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein, Streisand, and the failing football coach, Tom Wingo, Nolte. These two have a chemistry which draws them together against their will and sucks the audience along for the ride. Additional complexity, derived from the fact that they are both married, also enriches the experience. Because the story is ostensibly about the struggles Tom goes through as a result of his Sister's latest suicide attempt, the film often travels back in time. Lowenstein needs Tom to fill in the blanks about his sister's life so that she can be better treated. Unfortunately Tom is almost as reluctant to recall his childhood events as his comatose sister. This is not at all surprising when we eventually discover all the details. We slowly learn, along with Lowenstein, about a severe and traumatic family history. Three children, of whom Tom is one, are spiritually imprisoned by an abusive father and a manipulative, ambitious mother. Their only comfort is in each other, which is expressed perfectly whenever their parents fight, by their escape underwater where they hold hands in a ring of love. In the present though, even this bond has been sundered. Tom's older brother is now","Amazing, beautiful and a real life story.",There's some things you never get over.

8536,"Growing up in the 1970s, I had a 45 of Without You and my father played A Little Touch of....constantly. I like The Point when I saw it on TV but that was about the extent of my Nilsson experience. I knew he was good but that was about it. I bought this set on a whim based on a review from the Second Disc site and the excellent price and I thought it would be nice but I was not prepared for the emotional impact it would have on me. Going through the discs has been oddly moving for me. Some of it is nostalgia, some of it is regret that we do not live in an era where you can just write good pop songs, part of it is the loss of a talented life too young to go and part of it is the music. It all adds up and I have loved revisiting old songs and discovering new ones. The packaging is excellent. Every great artist deserves a retrospective like this. The original art on paper sleeves is great. The only logistical drag is the songs are only listed on a paper booklet. I wish there was a card or something handier for knowing the tracks. The sound quality is great. I love turning up the Gordon Jenkins arrangements on Touch full blast and not hearing the ticks and pops of my old LP. All of the sound is good if not great. Harry Nilsson's music is very broad and I think you have to limit our expectations and just go along for the ride. He had a much better understanding of classic American music from earlier eras than I had imagined. I think he is better at ballads and midtempo songs than rocking out but",A nice set!,Oddly moving

I have used it to create great ""home movies"" of my family especially the grandchildren, and I like that I can add professional touches or, at least, my version of professional, which is still very amateur! My favorite is adding soundtracks using my favorite music.

My granddaughter has also used the software to create a short, stopmotion movie. We all thought it was great! It is a good product that allows young people to be creative, with just enough bells and whistles to be effective, without being overly complicated and too technical!

VideoStudio installed easily, and, so far, has not given me any system problems. Its a very, very good product at a great price. I was not happy to read the information about the Protexis spyware, though, so I am going to follow the instructions in the comments which detail how to remove that.

Shame on you, Corel, for going too far and not respecting your customers' privacy. It will definitely make me think twice before buying another Corel product.

So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, ""I am waking up at the start of the end of the world/ but it feels just like every other morning before."" The song is catchy and wellwritten, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it does not really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.

But overall, a great song, a great single, a great group. Here is to hoping MB20 comes back much sooner rather than later. We need new material here!","Matchbox Twenty/20 is back in business, at least for this half bestof/ep...",One of Matchbox Twenty's Best Singles

Too many other brands are just too floral or ""sweet"" for my taste, almost as though it is doubling as a perfume after the shower, but not this one.  It is so light and just...perfect.  I am noticing a lot of reviews mentioning the reviewer's significant other loving the smell and I am thinking maybe it is a guy thing to love a simple clean smell on a woman not bathed in perfume because my husband loves the faint smell of this body wash after I take a shower.  Last thing I will mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.  After using this, I can either forgo the lotion after my shower or just use a light moisturizer.  Favorite body wash, hands down.","So fresh and clean, just what I was always searching for.

They will not give you ear crushing distortion or blow you away with heavenly clean, but they will articulate every note you play. Stock pups tend to blend notes into a muddy mess, these will not. I installed them on a Dean Vendetta XM and they sound good. I think they would sound better in a heavier wood body. I have never changed a pickup on my own, but these were EASY!!!

8610,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Great product!,Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

8613,"Uplink is a very interesting game for many reasons. Few games have engrossed me completely like Uplink does. The game is essentially a Hollywood computer hacking simulator. You start out with little experience, performing simple hack and steal missions. After an hour or so, you can expand to more devious items, like bank hacking, Social Security fraud, and adding, or removing, criminal records. After a while, and once you get accustomed to the environment, the story begins to unfold. Graphically, the game is minimalistic. It utilizes a very basic windowed interface. The install is small, and the game packs quite a few hours of enjoyment.
However, please do not purchase Uplink: Hacker Elite. Hacker Elite is the same game, but they do not pay royalties to the developers. Since this is an indie game, the idea is to get the money to those who made it. If you can, either purchase through Steam, or better yet, directly from Introversion Software.

8626,"I just finished installing a complete whole house water filtration system.  I used only pentek filters and housings.  I am very happy with the performance of my system and how well it all went together.  Here is a breakdown of the all the components I used in my system.  I went to great length researching what works and found it was not easy going thru each pentek filter and it is function.  The goal was to reduce some sediment, iron deposits from old iron pipes and remove any chemical taste.  The water tastes great now and is crystal clear.

Components:

Pentek Big Blue 20"" Filter Housings
Housing Bracket for Big blue 10"" and 20"" filter

Filters IN ORDER:
1Pentek DGD250120 Spun Polypropylene Filter 20 micron dual stage to 1 micron.
2Pentek 155263, RFFE20BB Radial Flow Iron Removing Filter
3Pentek RFCCBB Carbon Filter

you can add another Filter after the Carbon for media if you want.  Not necessary but is an option or run 2 sediment filters in beginning of the system.

Various copper pipes and PVC pipes to build the system.  I highly recommend a bypass valve and a way to shut off the water to your filters if you need to change them without losing water pressure to the house.

I experienced nearly 0 PSI drop thru the 3 filters and no noticeable change in flow rate.",Good solution for my system,How to build a whole house filtration system.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I had also noticed lately that I could see my skin color through the knee areas, which did not used to be that way.. I have other workout capris shorts that have lasted 5 years and counting... the fabric these capris are made from just is not durable in the long run, definitely not at this price. Original review: These workout leggings have several great features: The wide fabric waistband is more comfortable than a wide elastic waistband, yet it stays put does not fall down The fabric is breathable and comfortable, and feels a bit warmer in cool weather than spandex The cut of the opening around my calves is ideal because these do not slide up around my knees like some capri workout pants are prone to do The gusset is small but important design feature it definitely keeps these from riding up as much The claim on the tag that the fabric resists odors is true; I found them to be far less stinky after I workout than my spandex leggings The only drawback I found to these is because the jersey knit think of the texture of a tshirt is softer rather than slick and smooth like spandex, it picks up fuzz easily. During the colder months, I wear a pair of warmer sweatpants over my workout pants for going to and from the car an gym.

8644,"David Gilmour? Go up to a Pink Floyd fan and ask him who David Gilmour is. If he does not know, he is not a real fan, and he is certainly not big on music. Gilmour is a legend, a guitar virtuoso, and on top of that an excellent vocalist. And this, he claims with satisfaction, is better than anything he is ever done with Pink Floyd. Not true, but close. This album is very closely in ralation with The Division Bell. It is made up instrumentals and soft, easylistening songs. There is no standout song, but that is because it is not that kind of album. With much relevance to the name, 'On An Island' really feels like you are relaxing on an island, just letting the days pass you by without care. It is nice for a day when you need that sort of thing. Their are some good songs to be found here, of course: Castellorization A low level instrumental, with some very nice guitarwork. You can almost feel the emotion pour out of the guitar. On An Island A nice, easy song. It is slow, with quiet vocals and even the guitar work is not very standout. The Blue Pretty much the same as 'On An Island', but in this case, the lyrics are different. This Heaven A cool song that almost brings you back to the days of Floyd. Unfortunately, that is going a little too far. This is still a very soft song. Then I Close My Eyes Another song along the lines of Castellorization, but this one is a little better.

8656,"""Biomedical Ethics,"" by Thomas Mappes and David DeGrazia, now in its Seventh Edition, has been around in one form or another for more than 30 years. It is a competent though not exceptional text. It covers many of the standard issues in biomedical ethics, such as doctorassisted suicide, abortion, the physicianpatient relationship, patients' rights, decisions regarding lifesustaining treatments, experimentation on animals and human clinical trials, and healthcare reforms. Many of the standard and betterknown articles in these various areas of biomedical ethics are anthologized. Each chapter is introduced by a fairly helpful though at times somewhat dry description of the issues written by Mappes and DeGrazia. It is not as thorough as some texts Munson's ""Intervention and Reflection"" comes to mind, and it is definitely weighted toward medical ethics rather than bioethics in a broader sense, but it is certainly an appropriate text for a fairly advanced undergraduate course in the area.

The price for the paperback, which is approximately $100 is a bit steep, and the hardback edition is even more expensive. This is a drawback. But there is not a whole lot that can be done about this. However, instructors who are looking for a reasonable text for their students might want to look elsewhere.","Best book, but good",A competent work

Lydia move to Prestons old plantation in the middle of nowhere, where Kriun and Gabriel also live to hide from the rest of the world for various reasons.  To pay Preston back, she must give up all her freedoms freely; she must submit to all the men anytime they please, anyway they please.  She finds Kruin stoic and quiet; Gabriel caring and gentle; Preston controlling and degrading.  The Erotic Dark explores the development of Lydias relationship with all three men.  Lydia finds herself falling for Gabriel and freely giving herself to him; Gabriel is feeling the same way with Lydia but unfortunately a jealous Preston takes notice and thinks of various punishments and degrading situation to prove to Lydia that she belongs to him.
Although I am not sure how realistic a situation like this would be, overall the story was enjoyable.  All three men established some varying degree of domination over Lydia which was interesting to see develop.

I have sensitive eyes and have tried almost every mascara on the market from drugstore brands to professional theatre brands.  So far, this mascara does not clump, the texture is smooth and it really fluffs up my thin lashes.  The formula dries quickly enough to hold the curl in my lashes.  So far there has not been any noticeable flaking, but this tube is brand new. I will report back in a week and then another week after taht to see how the formula dries in the tube and when it starts getting dried and flaky.

8694,"I have been drinking IZZE for awhile now, albeit in bottles, not these cute little cans. First seen at Amazon, I have since found them at my local grocery store. I really enjoy the lightness. I do not drink soft drinks, mostly because I do not like them and actually prefer water. But sometimes, especially when eating something salty like pizza, I really enjoy a refreshing drink. Izze is perfect! TASTE: Definitely fruity, not overpowering. EFFERVESCENCE: perfect. Too much carbonation would overpower the flavor. Not enough and it would not be refreshing. HEALTH BENEFITS: sweetened with fruit juice, there is no high fructose corn syrup, just natural fructose. But do not be fooled, sugar is sugar and does contain calories. This is not a calorie free, or even calorie reduced beverage. But in the spectrum of sweeteners, if you are going to ingest 80100 calories in a beverage, this would be far superior to soft drinks, straight fruit juice, or beer. I cannot stand the taste of any artificial sweetener and far prefer this. So, why ""fortified""? From their own website, I discovered that in order to be sold in schools, beverages now have to meet the National School Beverage Guidelines, which require drinks to contain a minimum of 10 of the RDA of at least 3 vitamins. BY THE WAY, I think the Guidelines are an excellent idea, check out their website. IZZE fortified meets their standards in both calorie and vitamin content. There is been some talk around here about drug interactions with pomegranate, so if you are concerned, use some caution.

The face plate has been redesigned around the ""multicontrol,"" which will take a bit of getting used to, but not a problem so far. The rear AUX input may come in handy, and the 7band equalizer is a definite improvement on the 3band of the 670MP. I sort of prefer the manual dropdown face plate of the 670MP, but the motorized face of this unit is an enhancement. Of course my main interest in this newer model was its ability to play compressed music files from USB devices instead of burned CDs, and I have been very pleased with that aspect of this deck so far. I do not own an iPod, but my Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB fires right up through the USB cable and is quite responsive in the listscrolling action you press the ""list"" button on the face plate and get a menu of folders i.e. artist/album on the screen, which you can then scroll through using the multicontrol knob. The bigger challenge, predictably, is to get a USBpowered hard drive to work. Most important, aside from making sure the drive is FAT formatted, is getting enough power to the drive at initial spinup. Keeping the USB cable length as short as possible can help with that; I used an 24"" USB extension instead of the much longer one supplied, and it is plenty long to reach into the glove box actually the perfect length. I tried a 120 GB WD Passport, which spins at 5400 rpm without success.

8717,"Every couple of years, I get on a kick to get into genealogy and research and document my heritage. In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years. In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated or more accurately, most are still in Iran, I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years. So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work. I have used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial. It is much faster and easier to work with this software. I found the included documentation easy to use. Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy. I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really did not need it. Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well. For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month. In that time I did not encounter any glitches. Solid software. Another point about Ancestry.com is that I do not really need a persistent subscription.

8734,"My Quickie Review:
This is a short and sweet little novella which is all it is meant to be. It covers a few days at Christmastime and serves as a little bookmark for where Carter and Kat are in their lives as they move into their engagement. The story allows the reader to catch up with where they are in their lives and gives a little bit more insight into how difficult things are for Max in rehab, although he is never on the page.

As a fan of the first book, it is nice to see this little peek into their lives, but there is not much real substance or point to this novella. It is simply that...a tiny tidbit with a bit more of Kat and Carter for fans. And as that, it is a fun read.

The best thing about it...that beautiful cover. I love how soft and romantic it feels...very reflective of how good things finally are between Kat and Carter. I do love to see them truly happy and fulfilled together. This novella is very satisfying in that regard.

I fell out with Turbo Tax over an uninstallable DRM file a number of years ago they did come up finally with a tool to remove it and to be honest I am using Turbo Tax now because I was given a free copy.

PCCillin had everything going for it, except its firewall... Zone Alarm won.  Now, two years later, they have 'fixed' the problem.  You must uninstall zonealarm, install PCCillin, reinsatll Zone alarm... all this because PCCillins' firewall is HORRIBLE... it will let programs i.e. trojans on your pc access the internet.  Basically, you have no control over what programs get internet access and which ones do not.

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

8751,"This splendid three CD box set of Beethoven's complete Sonatas for Violin and Piano features perhaps the finest such duo of the mid20th Century: Violinist Arthur Grumiaux and Pianist Clara Haskil. They are equally renowned for their Mozart performances and Grumiaux produced a splendid recording of the Bach solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas. Haskil's various Mozart recordings, especially of the Piano Concertos, are some of the finest, most lyrically eloquent ever made. Both musicians represent the summa of music's Germanic core at midcentury in its recorded state. These three CDs place Beethoven's Sonatas in chronological order, making it easier to follow the progression of his musical thought and the evolution of his style. What one discovers quickly, aided by such splendid playing, is how swiftly certainly by the Opus 30 Sonatas, written in 1802 Beethoven relinquished Mozartean lyricism in favor of a motoric rhythmic drive and much shorter melodic lines. There is often an expansion and contraction of the musical pulse much like the intake and release of breath, frequently in the very same movement. This requires rhythmic flexibility, a subtly different, exquisitely free sense of time a la Furtwangler: a trait more common in the 40's and 50's than today's more rigid linearity. In other words, Beethoven had learned how to breath life into his music and Haskil and Grumiaux were positioned to express it effortlessly. That is what makes these recordings so good, so necessary for a serious Classical collection. Both performers are lyrical, capable of great beauty of tone, yet they are intellectual enough to convey the profound musical architecture of these pieces. You will enjoy these performances on several levels simultaneously: they are multidimensional performances as opposed to today's alltoooften 'singlenote' musicality. These recordings were made in early stereo between September 1956 and September 1957. They",Beethoven's Sonata for Violin and Piano featuring the finest of these musical performances,Beethoven interpretation at its peak of perfection

I knew nothing about guitars at the time and when I had my lesson in the studio with him was pretty much the first time I would ever laid hands on a classical guitar. So I appreciated his help. He asked me how much I wanted to spend and since I was not sure how long I would be playing and whether I would like it enough to continue for a long time, I said that I wanted a beginner type of guitar that would be reasonably priced. But I said I definitely wanted a brand new one. So we headed down to the Guitar Center store by Union Square in NYC. And my teacher took me to the back where they have the acoustic guitars. He picked out 2 different guitars, a Cordoba and a Yamaha and he played both of them for me so I could hear them. He played Romanze on both guitars so I could hear the differences. And then asked if I wanted to try them but i was too shy so I said I trusted his judgment. He said both guitars were good guitars and left it up to me to decide and I liked the warmer sound of the Cordoba and I liked the natural finish I did not like the shiny finish on the Yamaha.

I do not care for his new album against the grain, so I do hope Kurupt puts out another CD like this. Some bomb tracks on here are Girls All Pause featuring Nate Dogg, Who Ride Wit Us featuring Daz, Tha Streetz IZ A Mutha featuring Daz, and Ho's A HouseWife featuring Dr. Dre and Hitman. And you know when you have Dre on a tack you know it is going to be tight. Kurupt is one of the most underrated rapper's of the westcoast and pretty much the whole rap game. Kurupt does deserve to be noticed more. He is original and he always keeps it like that. Please Kurupt leave Death Row and and get some of this gangsta s!t back on the map.

8772,"I really liked this palette. The idea behind it is awesome, and I was able to blend a shade that matched my skin very well. The packaging was good, and I experienced no problems with a loose pan, damaged packaging, or makeup smeared on the mirror. It is a great idea, a great design, and I have made good use of it.

I am giving the product three stars still an approval/recommendation because the quality of the product is not stellar. It is not awful, by any means, and a little work and experimentation will result in something you can utilize well. The quality of the makeup is similar to many drug store brands. For $28, you are basically paying for the idea, the packaging, blending capability, and the multiple shades more than the quality itself.

That said, I honestly think this is a cool idea, and since I was able to make it work for me, I am happy with it and I recommend it.","Excellent product, very good quality and a nice texture","Great Idea, Great Packaging, and Decent Makeup"

8783,"So much has been written about Charlotte Bronte, her life and her famous novel  the subject of films  which fascinates both readers and viewers, that I hesitate to review it.

The novel interests me as much today as it did when I first read while at grammar school. Jane is an archetypical heroine bereft of friends and family, but she is no milk and water miss. Her principles are admirable. A weaker personality might have agreed to live in sin, as it was termed in her era, with the enigmatic Mr Rochester, who is passionately in love with her. When the truth about him is revealed at the altar Jane flees and is rescued by a clergyman and his sisters.

Janes tale has a happy ending but along the way there were characters both good and bad to entertain me. When I first read the masterpiece or should it be mistresspiece I was impressed by Helen, who takes orphaned Jane under her proverbial wing. Upon rereading the book I considered Helen a good friend to Jane, but too priggish for me to really like her. Nevertheless I admire all the twists and turns in the tale with the resultant emotion, and am one of its innumerable fans.",...,Jane Eyre

8794,"At the time I received this product to review in 2011 I did not quite understand what it was. We had just moved long distance and left all our old TVs behind since the moving company refused to move them. The new TVs we purchased in 2011 Vizio had apps on them. What that means is on the TV there is a menu to select that allows you to use an Amazon or YouTube or Netflix and other apps to access online content on your TV. What this CYBERLINK product does is that same thing but as an external device.

However, we can take our laptop, move it near the TV, attach a $20 HDMI cable to link the two, play the content on the website i.e. NetFlix, Amazon instant streaming movie rental, YouTube, etc. and it plays on the TV.

A good thing about this is you can link to a mobile smart phone or an iPad or tablet and show your photos or do any of the internet media playing. That is cool but it is something our family never wants or needs to do.

Because we have app enabled TVs this was an overkill, unnecessary product for us. People with older TVs which do not have apps may like this. However they could do much of the same thing with an HDMI cable and a laptop.

The instructions are great. They are a bit optimistic in saying it takes 45 minutes to put together. The instructions are clear but certain aspects of the assembly need serious elbow grease. It took this handy man well over an hour, and I still do not feel like I got the screws in tight enough to prevent it from being wobbly. Maybe I have been spoiled by IKEA furniture, but it seems to me there is room for improvement in this area.

LOOKS
It is a nice looking piece  very simple. The curve of the legs makes it look elegant. If you have like me a lot of black / deep brown furniture, it will fit right in.

UTILITY
My wife and I are currently using it as a doorside table and it is handy to put mail, schoolbooks and other items that are coming or going. Do not plan on fitting too much in the drawer. It quickly filled up with pens and envelopes and stamps. The area under the table I have found is perfect for stashing an exercise ball.

Essentially, The Lady Eve is the story of a naive but very wealthy adventurer right out of the Amazon, played by Henry Fonda in his only screwball performance who meets a sly and sexy girl named Eve, played by Barbara Stanwyck on a boat and immediately falls for her. When, however, he realizes she and her father are really professional gamblers who roam around getting money from people by playing card games, he is furious and leaves her. The rest of the movie deals with her hilarious efforts to win him back under a different name  that of the Lady Eve Sidwich.

8854,"I was never a big fan of disaster flicks but I remember this one as being decent. After revisiting it I am changing my tune.

Here is the scoop. Sylvester Stallone plays Kit Latura. He was a big wig in New York's Emergency Response Department. Something bad happened on his watch and some people got killed. He is tossed out. Now, through a series of flukes, the tunnel connecting NYC and New Jersey is collapsed at both ends and Kit just happens to be there why not?. He has to fight the politics and the circumstances to try and help those trapped inside.

This is directed pretty well. The problem is at the script level. In trying the figure out some of he problems in freeing the trapped victims Stallone, and some of those he is interfacing with, rattle off a lot of technical jargon. Well...they spew it out so fast they could just as easily been reciting a phonebook and I would not have known. And when he is down in the tunnel with the trapees there are a lot of dimestore platitudes about how ""we got to stick together"" and ""we can do anything we want if we try hard enough."" My God I thought someone from Hallmark might have written the script. And the trapees: Sometimes they are yelling at Stallone because they figure he is leading them to their doom. Other times he is their savior and will do whatever he asks. Sometimes they try hard and sometimes they are really nasty toward one another. There are also loads of cliches being bandied about.

It seems to have a consistent flow rate to it, good adhesion between layers and looks great when printed. I have been able to print toys for my children, puzzles for friends and various other pieces and parts to fix things I have broken and it is never disappointed.

My first experience with ABS was awful and I almost did not try it but a friend recommended that I try a better brand than the chinese knockoff garbage I had. As it turns out he was right because ABS is no problem to print with now and to keep cracking down to nil I just used a simple heat lamp that keeps the ambient temp up enough to not have any issues.

The whole harness itself when in use does move around loosely because of this so no matter what, I am still having to hold onto the leash tightly even though it is attached to this harness. Until I find something a lot better, this will have to do.","Works, but it moves around loosely",It's Okay...
8865,"I wanted a lightweight trimmer to cut back some overgrowth on our palm trees, cottonwood trees, and crepe myrtles.  I wanted to trim a little at a time each week so I could put it in our dumpster for disposal.

This was the the one I chose for price and capabilities.  I was really concerned when I first opened the box and saw how menacing the long 22 inch blade appeared.  I read the instructions and charged it overnight.  When I prepared for my first use I was delighted at how lightweight it was and when I turned it on I was very impressed with how quiet and smooth it ran.  My apprehensions disappeared immediately.

I have now used this several times over the past few weeks trimming a little at a time to fill the empty space in my dumpster on trash day.  It easily cuts the thick dead palm fronds without hesitation.  I have experienced no difficulty with anything I have tried to cut.  I really cannot address how long the charge lasts as I have as yet to have it run down.  I simply put the battery back in the charger when I am done for a few hours.  I did purchase the extra battery but do not think I will ever need both of them at the same time.",Lightweight and quiet,Lightweight but powerful trimmer.

8867,"Having gone through all of the Legend of Zelda Series available for the Nintendo DS/3DS, I found myself looking for a new game to play that was more puzzle based, but still had some type of storyline involved. As per recommendation from a friend, I was able to get a used copy of the first of the Professor Layton series Professor Layton and the Curious Village. As a fan of puzzles and Brain Teasers, I was completely enamored by this game. The puzzles range from very simple to ""I need to come back to this later"" difficult. There are a wide variety of puzzles, all of which can be solved without having any particular specialized knowledge of mathematical formulas and the like. You will need a good amount of deduction skills to solve some of these puzzles, and some puzzles are required if you want to progress in the storyline. The storyline is engaging and interesting, and throughout the game there are beautifully animated cut scenes that look as if they came straight out of an anime. The attention to detail in the game was quite nice, and while this game was short, it was fun for me to complete. There are plenty of bonuses in the game, including additional puzzles, access to the cut scenes and music, and even an extra bonus if you get the code from the sequel game, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box. I already ordered a copy and will be playing that soon! The character designs are whimsical, and the village backgrounds are simplistic and reminiscent of something out of a Studio Ghibli film. The one drawback of ordering and playing this game now is that all the downloadable content that was available when this game was first released is no longer available. Apparently",Fun to complete and learn!,"Fantastic Game for Puzzle/Brain Teaser Fans, Interesting Storyline, Gorgeous Cut Scenes"

8874,"I have mixed feelings about this watch. As soon as I opened the box, I checked the shipping label to make sure I was not sent a Men's watch by mistake.  Even though it is being marketed as a Women's watch, in my humble opinion, it has too much of a clunky, heavy appearance to be described as feminine. It would have been helpful to see a photo of this watch on a female model. Also, the item description claims this watch has a retail value of $495.00 ....really??? I find this really hard to believe. Amazon price $79.99

In spite of the fact this watch is HUGE, it is a nice looking time piece for the money. The cobalt blue dial is beautiful with the 18 kt gold plated band. I like the readability of the display. I measured the inner circumference to be 81/2 inches. I am hoping once I have it resized to fit my wrist it will grow on me a little more and not look quite as HUGE.

One more thing....it does keep accurate time.


I have lived with this watch for nine months. It still keeps accurate time, but I regret buying this product.  The band has not worn well.  The crystal chipped, the exposed blue finish is scratched.  It is starting to look pretty beat up. I have never had a watch show so much wear in such a small about of time. I will probably dump it when the battery wears out.  I have had $10 watches wear better than this thing. I have already replaced it with a Citizen ecodrive from Amazon. I wish I would have purchased the Citizen watch to begin with.",Great watch for women,Did Flavor Flav consult on the design of this watch?

The fact that  ""Shot"" is now on DVD in widescreen makes it that much more  special. The supporting cast Elke Sommer, Herbert Lom, George Sanders, and  Bert Kwouk, among others is perfect and provides a perfect ensemble foil  to Sellers.

But for those who train hard, be it running, biking, swimming or lifting weights, reGen's new Chocolate Muscle Recovery is an excellent postworkout drink, offering a balanced 3:1 carb to protein ratio. For those uninitiated, a 3:1 carb to protein ratio has been established as a key balance for replenishing glycogen stores in the muscles, thus preventing catabolism where your body breaks down muscle tissue as energy and allowing for peak muscle/protein synthesis.

Iv clocked well over 4000 prints on my 5, 3d printers, and this Hatchbox filament is fairly consistent in diameter which is usually the big quality issue, so good there.. but after printing 1 spool of Hatchbox black filament i had to strip and clean my hot end to remove an odd buildup of burnt material adhering to the stainless steel filament path and making flow intermittent,.. 4000 prints under my belt, and I have never seen build up like this before with any other PLA. Was it contaminated, does it have filler, are they blending,. I do not know, all i know is that I did not receive pure PLA.
The other big issue is color,. I ordered red, what i got was labeled red,.. but the color on the spool was most certainly orange. I am a photographer, I know color, so I am not just being picky, this is tangerine at best, and nowhere near as close to red as the recolored photo shows.
Ultimately I returned the ""red"", and if i had any black on the spool to return I would have returned that also.
Oh, and i did not even get a form response when i wrote to them asking nicely about the color issue. aka 0 customer service.

8914,"Well shame on the people involved in this ""SACD Deluxe Edition"" project. Oh, maybe that is a little harsh. First off, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the sound has been aggressively compressed, which means, by the time you have reached the later stages of the album, you may experience some ear fatigue. The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics. I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix. Another sign of over compressing. It seemed to help at least a couple songs ""The Balance,"" where the bottom end was a lot more in control and ""Never Comes The Day,"" which sounded really clear and focused. But, overall, has the whole music industry gone ""compression"" crazy? Or, are the Moody Blues worried that their back catalogue the holy seven was lacking musical muscle, and are super charging it with heavy compression? Also, another reviewer talked about the bass being too quiet for the surround sound mix, but I felt the bass was not as strong on the ""regular"" mix, as it is on the other ""SACD Deluxe Editions."" It is reasonable, but not as breathtakingly boosted as the others in this deluxe series. Another thing about aggressive compression, this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI ""remaster"" of Deep Purple's 1973 album ""Who Do We Think We Are."" By the time I got towards the end, my ears were tired. So, recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression, and it not only sounded better, but my ears were not tired by the end. But, since the Moodies do not play as loud, it should not be a problem. Now that I got that off my chest... Secondly, the ""SACD Deluxe Edition"" bonus track enticement, just ticks me off to",No problems with its quality and bass,INTENSE re-mastering...

It could possibly be that I received a demo that was not quite ready for market, because I cannot imagine that Clarisonic, a company with a reputation for quality and innovative skin care, would release a subpar device. The original Clarisonic has an elongated handle with a sculpture stand. The Smart Profile as well as the Mia are designed with an easy to grip handle. In order to get the footprint smaller, and perhaps to make it more genderneutral, the Mia FIT model is more bullet shaped and rests comfortably on its own little disc charger. Not quite as comfortable to hold as you are cleansing your face, but probably not enough to be a dealbreaker. As with all models, the Mia Fit is waterproof. A big plus to the Clarisonic line is the fact that you can take it in the shower, or rinse it under a running tap, without risking any damage to the unit. In addition, every model that I have owned or used has had a nice long battery life between charges. Not only does this unit NOT hold a charge as well, there is also a design flaw that women in particular will find more than a little annoying. The button to turn it on must be pressed extremely hard in order to get the unit to operate. I am not able to do it with my fingertip. It requires the bottom of your toothbrush or tweezers to press the button enough to get it to turn on.

I have one of those firstgeneration consumer digital video cameras a Sony MiniDV that cost $1200 way back when.

I love how you can charge and exchange data by USB. I am not talking about using a separate USB cable. The Mino has a springloaded USB plug that pops out so you can plug it in directly to your computer. And when you are done using it, you push the plug down and a hard plastic cover protects it automatically.

However, once I had Firefox open, a Norton plugin kept crashing. This did not stop anything there is a button to refresh or to send a report. Either one fixed the problem and uncrashed Norton. Still, it was annoying. I tried running the quick scan again and that totally solved the problem. Macs are susceptible to vagaries of the internet; there is one insidious worm in particular that will try to fill your hard drive with junk. Fortunately, a friend does the IT work for the 15 Macs in his science lab and, after running a long scan with Norton, cleaned things up enough that he could identify the worm and remove it for me. Since then, it is been added to Norton's fixit capabilities. He told me to get Norton and use it religiously. It saves a lot of hassle. I have been a Norton fan since 1990, when I bought my first DOS computer and Norton Commander was the only menu system worth having.

Make sure you have your BBQ attached to the propane AFTER the pressure regulator at the tank.  The hose that comes with the BBQ does not come with a regulator and the BBQ needs the reduced pressure.  I think this is the problem with the people that had theirs get too hot.  The 57628 that I bought had the regulator and worked like a charm.  They also have one that will hook to a 30lb tank directly that comes with a regulator.  Enjoy.,...,Good Grill

8970,"Looks new but have lots of trouble. I purchase this refurbished EA4500 in hoping to increase the wireless link speed of the delivered 2Wire 3801 gateway from uverse. The router is easy to setup however, everytime I tried to setup the media prioritization, the speed defaults to 54Mbps max. I have to turn off media prioritization and reset the router to get a max speed of 130Mbps. I believe that the max speed is due to the limitation of my devices I have a 2012 Kindle fire HD 8.9"" and 7"", Galaxy S3, Moto G, and a 2014 Acer laptop so I do not complain about the max speed not reaching 450Mbps as advertised. I have an Amazon Fire TV Stick but for the life of me, I could not find a way to measure the WLAN link speed. I played with different setting and I could not get the device to only use Wireless N without resetting the router daily. When I select Wireless N only on both channels, the 2.4 Ghz signal will stop working on a daily basis. The worst part is that the device will show that it is connected with good signal but when I try to browse the internet or access a file from my server, nothing will work until I reset the router. When I select Mixed, the device works well. I also noticed that the 2Wire router have stronger signal than this device. With the 2 Wire I get 54Mbps on all corner of my house. The EA4500 is at 130 on the same floor but can go down to 60's on the farthest place I can go inside my house.

I absolutely love this Trilogy!  Connor is so alpha and sexy even though at times I wanted to knee him in the junk.  Elle is so strong, smart, creative and a great female lead!  The characters are so beautifully written and conveyed such emotion.  The attention to the fine details that make the story are amazing and not overwhelming.  I really like Sam and her appearances in the books.  She could be potentially a player in a spin off.  Denny is so loveable and I enjoyed the major role he played in the lives of Connor and Elle.  Let us not forget Mason and Peyton...those 2 are what best friends are made of.  I was sad to see the series close, but it was ended so wonderfully that it left me happy as well.

8998,"Yesterday I began reading this story of fifteen year old Lina's family, who were sent to a Soviet labour camp from their home in Lithuania in 1941, and finished reading it today. I could not put it down. It is a very compelling read.
I knew about Stalin's labour camps and salt mines, but had no idea how many Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Finns were deported from their countries and how many never returned. It was a massive genocide which should never be forgotten. This book aimed at a Young Adult readership should help to keep the memory of those victims alive for future generations. Their courage and sacrifice should be immortalized

9009,"We were very interested in this cookbook, because I have cooked Italian food my entire life, learning from my dad and my grandfather, who was born in Italy. My lasagna recipe, handed down from generations included only ground beef, with different cheeses, and homemade marinara sauce. It was time for me to learn a variety of tasty, lasagna dishes, and this book was the perfect selection, which I purchased at a great price. Mary Miller delivers several delicious lasagna recipes that are simple, and easytoprepare. Many of the Ingredients are common, which is an added bonus. Each recipe includes Prep Time, Ingredients, Number Of Servings, and Directions With CookTime. In addition, there are some colorful photos, and the Introduction is inspiring. The author Includes several different recipes, and like all her recipe books, includes a few links in the back of the book on living a healthy lifestyle. Mary Miller discusses the history of lasagna, the benefits of freezing, and helpful tips on cooking, in the Introduction. What I love the most about lasagna is that there are always leftovers, and in the past years, I made it, and stored in the freezer for special occasions. This was a great advantage, since I was working fulltime. I would make is on days off, or the weekends. Since I am still working a great deal, I will be making freezing a lot, it is wellworth it. Some of the Recipes include: 4 Cheese With Spaghetti Sauce; Garlic Oregano; SlowCooked 3 Cheese; Spinach And Artichoke; Chicken With Cream Cheese; Vegetable Summer; NoBake 3 Cheese; Traditional; Italian With Basil; Shrimp And Crab; Zucchini With Oregano And Basil; Traditional; Barbecue Mozzarella; And more.

9016,"Cover

I like the way the symbols are part of the cover. It is a bit mysterious with only a portion of the woman's face. There is not much going on but it is intriguing at the same time. And her eyes are beautiful!

Characters

Zoey is a pretty decent main character. She is a typical teenager going through a life altering situation and she kind of loses her head. But she makes up for it. I absolutely adore her gay friend! I hope there is a side story about him one day. The twins are pretty cool and entertaining. Erik gave me a creepy vibe at first but he might just turn out to be a decent character in the long run.

Story

This book was really easy to get through. The plot is engaging and the characters are fun. It was hard to pull myself away because I wanted to know what would happen next. It is a unique story of overcoming one of life's obstacles and I am interested to see where the rest of the series will go.

9017,"I bought FIFA 14 as it is the only football game currently available on next gen consoles. Expecting a slightly modified visually version of the currentgen consoles, I did not even get that.

Graphically, the game has been upped to 1080p with an impressive removal of jaggies, but that is about it. All the textures are the same, the player models are the same, and the crowds are in poor 3D form.

Now you would think they would just use the mold of current gen and up the graphics on this one, right? Nope. There is no Tournament mode on this version. Furthermore, Career Mode is BROKEN. You cannot finish a game! After you play a game, and you go to ""Advance"" or even try to quit mid game with ""end match"", the game crashes with an error, and there you are, back on the PS4 UI. Lovely. You would think two important omissions would be described by the many video game website reviews, but no, they are useless.

So basically, you are giving EA $60 for a game missing a huge singleplayer mode, and a broken career mode, for a slightlyimproved visually FIFA 14. And then EA wonders how they are the worst company. This game has certainly made me hesitant to buy their products, and am now staying away from Battlefield 4.","No, you don't care what the game looks like.",BROKEN Career Mode ands NO Tournament Mode

I measured the item before ordering it and had no issues.  It is about 1/4"" larger than what I measured which is as described, but that is to allow the notches in the filter housing to hold the filter in place.

I really hope Rhino learns something from Sony and puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is way too expensive.
This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!",Good compilation.,Lucky Clash!

9052,"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE matcha. I have giant bags of it that I use in my tea, my smoothies, and sometimes even in my sauces. I also like coconut water. I find it to be refreshing and I even put it in strong tea to help water it down. I do not know why the combination of the two is so horrible! I was very excited to try this because I love both beverages so much. I took one sip and could barely stand it. But the third sip, I had to spit it out. It takes terrible, but the worst part is the after taste. It leaves a horrible taste in your mouth but I also felt like there was almost a film over my tongue. There are TONS of health benefits to all of the ingredients. However, I would recommend just making your own drink which is BOUND to taste better than this one.","Beautiful, healthy and strong",I'm sorry...it's gross
9053,"I have tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it is really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It does not have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it is a good lowfrills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There is plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25 less expensive.",Very good shaving soap,Great soap - but soapy scent

9057,"Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to clean a 21 foot long vent,Worked like a charm

9060,"I found this book on my recommendations list on amazon.com and decided to give it a try. I ordered a copy and thought it might please me, although I thought it would never compare to Jane Austen or Fanny Burney. I began to read it, and was shocked at how well it was written, and in first person journal form. I immediately fell in love with the style of writing, but also with the main characters. This book has a little bit of everything, despair, romance, a coming of age story, a dysfunctional family, lies and deceit, pain and loss, mental illness, different settings. I read it twice, and then told all of my close friends to read it. I went on amazon and ordered copies and had them sent to my friends across the country. I could not believe that a book written by the same woman who wrote 101 Dalmations could be this good of a coming of age story for teens and adults. I am in awe of the story within this book, and I HIGHLY recommend reading it. I hope you will not be disappointed.",Definitely worth the price,One of my Top Five favorite books.

9063,"All real vocals in the studio with no technology altering! Like they did back in the day. In Betcha Bottom Dollar's case, the 40's and up! Their harmony's are impeccable as is their choice of song. They obviously resemble The Andrew Sisters and The Boswell Sisters with their renditions of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, In The Mood, Bei Mir Bist Du Sc hon, Heebie Jeebies, Jeepers Creepers and Java Jive. In the early 70's Bette Midler, Barry Manilow, Melissa Manchester, Manhattan Transfer and the Pointer Sisters also paid tribute and got their start performing this type of music. Of course they all went on to do many other major achievements in the music industry. What makes this CD so appealing in this day and age is that they also take songs from other time periods and give them a new twist...or an old one as it is! Listen to how cleverly they recorded Blondie's Heart Of Glass and Gloria Gaynor's anthem I Will Survive. You never heard them like this...and how refreshing! I am also impressed with other selections like the reworking of The Smiths Panic and Kate Bush Wuthering Heights which were big UK hits. Also included is Sway which has made a comeback via Michael Buble and Tu Voi Fa L'Americano made famous in The Talented Mr Ripley movie. There is also a fabulous version of Mr. Sandman which was recorded by The Chordettes, McGuire Sisters and Emylou Harris. Last but not least is the perfect song to open this set, Sisters, which was recently covered by Bette Midler Linda Ronstadt on Bette's Rosemary Clooney tribute. These girls are awesome and it will be a pleasure to watch them blossom into and awesome vocal trio. They are currently working on a second CD with all of the above",Great,Bette'Cha will like it!!

Gameplay is smooth with the large levels having a ton of detail.  The storyline is a good progression and it is nice not to have to be limited to only one storyline.  If you like working for a certain boss, do all of his missions or do none.  The game is not dependant upon which missions you complete some exceptions.  The ability to get in a boat, car, tank, etc makes the monotony of just driving around go away.  There are numerous secrets to discover in all of the cities.

9071,"I bought 4 colors of nail polish and 1 bottle of the topcoat, each for about $11.
While I know that is not the most expensive nail polish out thereit is a lot more than I usually pay.

I have used the polish three times and have been less than blownaway by it. I have used the Serene Green on my toes and it has held up pretty well. However, the Electric Orange I have used twice on my fingernails has two problems: the color is sheer enough that I do not feel two coats gives enough coverage you still see streaks through to my nail and it has chipped or worn off the end of the nail within a couple of days. So the 57 days touted has just not been my experience. The polish seems to chip or wear off much less than normal polish but, still. My expectations were higher for this product.

One thing I did find out is that the first 2 coats of color seem to stay a bit stickyI tried letting them dry for several minutes to an hourbut as soon as I  put the topcoat on, it dried pretty hard after about 10 minutes. So the topcoat is important and it seems to ""dry"" the first coats very well.",I bought 4 colors of nail polish and 1 bottle...,"Ok, but I'm not sure it's worth the price"

9085,"Today is Halloween 2014. I wrote this review right after I thought my speaker died. I forgot to write one after a few months of using it. I was listening to a song and suddenly I heard a scratching sound and then the speaker went dead. I was sad and thought that maybe it was time for it to die since I have had it for almost 4 years with moderately heavy use. I turned the speaker off, but after a while of too much quietness at work, I got curious to see if it was really dead. I plugged it back in my phone and turned the speaker on and pressed play. Sound!! I wonder what happened. I am thinking it is getting close to its useful life. I will post an update when it really dies to see how long it really lasted. Review: I bought this little speaker in December 2010. I have used this thing pretty much every day since I bought it, with all kinds of different music. It has been a good speaker for its size and price range. There are a few things that could bother some people, but it was not a big deal for me: When charging while listening to music, you can hear a little bit of static in the quiet parts of the songs or between songs, but I do not mind because it reminds me of music being played in a turntable; it is also temporarily until it finishes charging. When listening with the maximum volume on your device, the sound can be a little bit distorted, but who listens to loud music from a small speaker? You have to remember that this is a tiny speaker. If you want louder sound, get a bigger one. When listening",Sound!! I wonder what happened.,Good little speaker. 3 years 10 months and still going.

9094,"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to 1. What is the secret? Apparently America just loves those female RB Love Song vibes.

Leona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the RB Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that is always a positive.

So overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it is pathetic. It is also a nice change of pace that Leona is not practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done.

9097,"With nearly 20 years of experience with 3d printing i think my expectations of a $1500 sla printer were reasonable. I have had this thing for a few months now, gone through 2 bottles of resin and one resin tank and have yet to get a single usable part from it. When i test small parts on high resolution and the machine actually works the parts look great but it almost never works. When i first got the machine it would buzz very loudly for a few minutes when powered on, i submitted a service ticket to XYZ on this issue and never got a response, fortunately the loud buzzing just seemed to go away one day. Using the autofill feature because the resin bath to over fill, i have found resin ON TOP of my build platform as well as under the resin tray and on the glass above the laser assembly. Not to mention the autofill pump is absurdly loud. Most of my prints that have started do not stick to the print bed causing a waste of material and wear on the resin tank. Standard response from XYZ on this issue is to try recalibrating the print bed with no resin in the resin tray. This means you have to dump resin back in to the bottle which is an absolute mess AND this defeats the NFC tag that monitors resin use. I have nearly 3/4 of a bottle of resin but two bottles that the machine reads as empty. Software is buggy, I am running windows 10 on a fairly robust machine built for CAD work. The software crashes a lot, can take a long time to import and manipulate parts and currently i cannot print anything because the software will not complete the slice operation",Better than expected,BOOOOO XYZ

9127,"Bad Habits shows that Colin James has come a long way since his selftitled album seven years earlier 1988. The playing on this album has a definite edge to it. This album is full of some of his own tunes mixed with a strong respect for the blues and its masters.
The music on this album is very powerful. Throughout this album, he is able to mix in horns with his funky blues sound. ""Saviour"" heavy rhythm introduces us to this album with a large support from the horn section as well as some great slideplaying. The groove is pretty catchy, and you will have a tough time getting it out of your head. My favorite track from the album is James' own ""Freedom"". Again, the horns add depth, and his solos are soulful without being overwhelming. Less than half of the songs on this album are James' own, but he steps up to the challenge and plays exceptionally on Howlin' Wolf's ""FortyFour"" and Elmore James' ""I Cannot Hold Out"". He even does a heavy slide version of Robert Johnson's ""Walkin' Blues"", different but tasteful.
James is an exceptional guitar player. Listening to this album one can see why he opened for SRV. In fact, sometimes I can close my eyes and almost see SRV playing, like on the album's title cut.

9133,"For starters this product definitely does everything everyone raves about.  It is an excellent light coverage on my skin which goes between fair and medium depending on how recently I selftanned and blends in seemlessly.  It seems to soak in well an dI've never had problems with it running if I workout after applying.

The reason for the 1 star reduction is that I think it feels a bit chalky, almost like there is flour in it.  This does not seem to effect the appearance, and the feeling fades from my face after about half an hour, so it is not the end of the world, it is just not my favorite feeling.",Good product,"Love it, would be 5 stars but can feel slightly chalky"

9141,"I have had four previous versions of this product before online mapping sites made the pretripplanning portion of this software mostly obsolete. It has had a good run. It still offers something to those who want to plan long roadtrips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems. The mapping system does what it says it does, so that is fine.... What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works. Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky well, no, and unless you are driving in a convertible.... Finally, as a passenger in a minivan, I was able to obtain ""constantintermittent"" service. ""Huh?"" you might well ask. Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice even my old GPS has 6 smooth voicechoices for English that it was rerouting and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is. That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles. I tried the maletofamale USB cord they included to enhance the signal. It is 28"" long not including the connectors. This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your laptop and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful. Another loser component. There is no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2yearold Garmin has. That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and",Good product.,Witnessing the extinction of a dinosaur....

Albeit, a 19 year old can be awed by power, as in Marian's case.

9167,"In this story of American angst and family degeneration, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, father and husband, who hates his job, is getting fed up with his wife, and dislikes his life in general. One day, he snaps. He realizes how empty his life is, quits his job, and ceases to care about anything. He becomes free. First, the acting is among the best dramatic work you will ever see in a film. Kevin Spacey one of the best actors in film right now and Annette Bening have some excellent performances. By now, we know that characters like Lester are the perfect roles for Spacey cynical, attitudinal, sarcastic. The way he delivers his lines and acts is very impressive: managing to drop the subtlest notes of sarcasm and irony into his voice, being cool yet so acidic at the same time, and injecting his attitude with such cynicism and repressed emotion, he shows in this film why he is one of our best. Likewise, Annette Bening shines and is almost scary in how deeply she seems involved in her character, projecting her hyper uneasiness and the sense that she knows how pointless her life is, yet still tries to hide it. American Beauty discuss the image of the perfect American middleclass family, and the reality of it. In Lester's family and marriage, there is no American beauty. The film makes the case that true ""American beauty"" is probably not what you think it is namely, not the seemingly happy family or guy with a nice job. But rather, real Beauty is to be found everywhere in life, if one simply looks for it. Lester snaps because he is intelligent: he realizes that his life holds no meaning for him, he hates his job, and his marriage is fake.

9179,"Purchased this fan for our master bedroom. We wanted a fan with a remote control to make it easy to turn off the light without reaching for a pull cord. We researched fans at a local store but could not find one with the remote control included. The salesman explained that the remote control would work with any fan that had the room for the remoter control receiver but we were skeptical so we wanted find one that came as a package deal. This fan met the requirements. Reasonable price and a good brand we thought. We were somewhat disappointed that the light fixture only comes with the candelabra base. Candelabra bulbs are much more expensive. The fan was reasonable to install. It takes two people to hold it and position it. The remote receiver just barely fits in the fan. We had to push all the wiring through into the ceiling box to make room for the remote receiver. When we first turned it on, we were very happy. One surprise was that if the power goes off, the remote resets to off. This means if you want light or fan, you must use the remote. My first thought was that if the battery failed, we would have no way to turn on the lights in the room. The battery is also some sort of special voltage and design. Good luck trying to find a replacement. We did not have to worry about the battery. Two weeks after installation, the remote receiver failed. We had no lights in our bedroom and no way to turn them on. We had to call for emergency help to remove the remote receiver. Remember the part about pushing the wires up into the ceiling box? Well we had to remove the whole fan",Fantastic fan!,"Fan is great, remote is junk"

9192,"One of the things I dislike about concealers is that it can settle into otherwise invisible lines around the eyes and make you look older, but Vincent Longo Perfect Canvas Concealer rides the surface of the skin and keeps your complexion smooth.  It is capable of concealing shadows under my eyes even after I pull an allnighter.  My eye luggage is not very dark,  so I cannot speak for how well it covers darker shadows.  I have been using a dab on a freckle right at the edge of my lip and it covers that well, too. I also like it as a light foundation on my eyelids when I use shadow. It is light and sheer in feel.

My skin is quite fair but the medium works surprisingly well for me. I do not use very much and I feather it in. I rarely use any foundation mineral powder or otherwise with it yet the concealer remains invisible, blending smoothly with my skin.

Do make sure you moisturize before putting it on or it will not work so smoothly.

This concealer pen is a twisttype and has a sponge that let us beads of concealer come through. I love this style of makeup, but there are two things you need to know. First, do not think  as I did  that it is broken or dried up. It is not; it simply takes a LOT of turns to start it up the first time.

I mainly create short videos, mainly of the tutorial variety, and this had an easier learning curve than Corel. Do not get me wrong, though, there is still a steep learning curve, but at least the ""help"" is actually helpful.

The suite offers a slew of effects many of which I will admit to not having tried simply because they do not apply to me, but they do have the basic transitions one is likely to usefade, cross fade, so forthit allows for adding subtitles/closecaptioning, and for doing voiceovers.

Finally, rendering video was relatively speedy. To render a 15min. mpg took less than 5 minutes which was delightful, and the couple hour long features I needed to edit required about 30 minutes apiece. Your mileage may vary.

Irrefutable picks up where Fallacy left off, so you have to read it first to fully live the experience. Quinn Taylor is backed against a wall, where her decisions are not her own anymore, and the plan does not include Alex Conway, no matter how much she wishes it differently. Her life has spun out of control, and she no longer knows what to believe in anymore, and it is affecting her badly. Alex wants Quinn, but he is not sure he would survive another heart break. He realizes there is more to the story than anyone knew, but he is not sure how to get her out of it, when she will not tell him why she is marrying another man. Will Alex be able to get Quinn to see that she is about to make the biggest mistake of her life? I was so mad at this author for the ending of Fallacy, and although I am not over the wait, she exceeded my expectations to such a degree, that it was ALMOST worth the wait. The character development is fantastic, with the amazing and entertaining cast of secondaries. An emotionally charged, twisty, and very well written storyline flows effortlessly. Alex and Quinn's flammable chemistry is ever present, and thank God, finally ignites into FIERY FLAMES of sexy scene goodness again.

I am not looking for a return to ""Hello it is me""... but I am looking for Todd to get back to being himself The Individualist from a creative standpoint. This album reeks of trying to mimic a contemporary sound while I would be happy with Todd creating his own new sound. Sort of like Side 1 of ""Faithful"" yeah I was impressed but eventually it comes off as a novelty and I always just stick to side 2 of that album.

Always one to play with all the latest technology, TR occassionally starts slipping into areas where the technology takes over and, instead of enhancing the work, buries it. I sense some great songs buried underneath all the noodling and noise on this album while about half just are not up to his usual level of songwriting. I think everyone agrees that ""Liars"" was a benchmark and source of optimism for most of the hardcore fans State is his 4th album since and just is not up to those high standards. The good news is Todd never stays in one place very long so I expect his next body of work to be a radical departure one can only hope.

I have previously read ""Queen Victoria: A Personal History"" by Christopher Hibbert and found that hearing about Victoria from the vantage point of her relationship with her daughters painted an even more in depth view of this famous monarch.

It was generally an easy read, if you could keep the seemingly hundreds of relations and cousins and their nicknames straight. My one complaint is that the book read chronologically and it was difficult to switch between sisters sometimes especially when the author felt the need to skip BACK in time when changing sisters, completely throwing off the otherwise chronological nature of the book.

9252,"Remarkably for a book written in 1938, this amazing volume is as compelling today as it was then. Extremely wellwritten, passionate, and erudite, C.L.R. James's classic is still the starting point I would recommend for anyone interested in Haitian history. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the French Revolution. The narrative reads like a great novel, despite being a wellresearched history book. Years before mainstream YOU.S. or European historians saw Carribbean history as relevant, the West Indian James showed its import for both Western and Global History. First, James shows the utterly heartbreaking treatment the slaves of SaintDomingue now Haiti were subject to. Then he demonstrates the contradictions in Western Revolutionary thought which used emancipatory language but refused to address the issue of colonial slavery. Then the leaders of the slave revolution emerge in his story as true sansculottes, Jacobins and patriots in their own right; men and women who refuse to let Napoleon reenslave them and forge a nation. Their act of ""rebellion"", the creation of the first black republic in the Americas and the only successful slave revolt in history, would strike fear into the hearts of slaveowners everywhere. They would pay for taking the heady egalitarian language of the 18th century seriouslyin both the 19th century and the 20th and beyond, they would be subject to pay enormous indemnities to Europe for having ""taken"" the plantations of the whites, be subject to embargos, be forcibly invaded on several occasions, have dictators foisted upon them, and much more. But none of that could take away the fact that their courage, bravery, and love of freedom had earned them their freedom from slavery and that their history deserved to be recorded, admired, and preserved. No one has ever done that more skillfully","Great book, great story",Best History Book Ever Written

9254,"Currently, my kitten 5 mos old has just completed the toilet kitty... She is now peeing pooping in the toilet! To begin with, I will agree with other reviewers that not every single cat will adjust and go in the toilet. However, many of them can and will. It just takes a lot of patience, both with time and occasional ""accidents"" while toilet training your cat. The flushable cat litter I used was World's Best Cat Litter. The whole process has taken me about 34 months. I personally think that the kit progresses too quickly. One week in between rings is too quick. You should wait 23 weeks in between each ring removal. I started my kitten when she was 12 weeks old already had her litter box next to the toilet and when I set the tray on the toilet, I gave her a little ""step"" so she could easily climb up until she was a little bigger. Accidents to date: 5 she peed on a trash bag we had next to the door twice and in her large food bowl three times. I have since switched her to a smaller food bowl and she has not us any accidents for the past month. She did however use our little ferret's litter box 3 times as well during the process, but I do not really call those ""accidents"" because she technically went in a litter box. Thankfully, that did not because her to regress in her training.

9267,"I bought this 1/2""  4 foot long belt from another vendor.  I was getting some very annoying vibrations on my Delta contractor's saw. After about 15 minutes of loose measuring and removing about 5 inches from the Power Link belt, and then installing it, my Delta has never run better or smoother.  My other belt, which only had a few hours on it, is in the trash bin.

The 4 foot length should probably fit most any contractor's saw that has the motor out the back of the saw, like the Delta.  This Power Link belt is very easy to work with and has simple, clear instructions.  You remove your old belt, measure the Power Link belt against the old one and remove links if necessary. With the contractor saws, you seem to have quite a bit of latitude on the length. Mine ended up being slightly shorter than the standard belt that it replaced. Then you splice the belt together, which is very easily done, by inserting tabs into slots. I used a pair of needle nose pliers to work with the tabs. Install the belt on the saw, noting the arrows for proper rotation direction and you are done. Works like a champ.  I will be putting these belts on all of my belt driven tools.",Good belts,terrific belt

My wife said it felt dry rather than creamy when applying, so much so that she felt she had to apply another moisturizer on top. There was also a noticeable smell which she did not like at first  not unpleasant, just strong  but gradually became ok with her after a few hours.

I did not notice the dry feel to the degree she mentioned. It is not as liquidy or creamy or greasy as some other moisturizer lotions but I did not feel like I needed to apply another product on top. I have used ""intensive care"" moisturizers before which had a similar feel. I noted a slight sweetish odor similar to some beauty soaps or talcum powder, but to me it was unnoticeable within a few minutes.

I recently saw Gary Clark Jr. in concert for the first time more on that later. I was generally aware of Clark, but cannot say that I was a huge fan, as his type of music heavy bluesoriented rock is okay but not my top favorite.

""Blak and Blue"" 13 tracks; 68 min. starts off with the excellent ""Are not Messin' Around"", which immediately reminds you of music you might expect from Cream today if they were still around. ""When My Train Pulls In"" is a heavy tune which at 8 min. goes on about 34 min. too long. Much better is the title track right afterwards. Other highlights on here for me include ""The Life"", which comes with a lighter touch, ""Glitter Are not Gold Jumpin' For Nothing"", with an infectious chorus, and the last 2 tracks, ""You Saved Me"" and the album closer ""Next Door Neighbor Blues"". In all, this is quite the album. From my own perspective, as a casual fan, this album could have been even better with tighter editing. An hour and 10 minutes is just too long.

This past weekend I saw Gary Clark Jr. in concert at the Verizon Center in Washington, opening for Kings of Leon. He and his band mates played a thundering 50 min. set consisting of just 6 songs, 4 tracks from this album including a mighty ""Are not Messin 'Round"" and a version of ""When My Train Pulls In"" that seemingly went on forever, certainly over 10 min. and 2 covers, ""Catfish Blues"" and ""3 Of the clock Blues"".

Here are our thoughts: Me 52, do not wear makeup, normal skin, no real issues. The product seemed too oily to me, I worried it would cause break outs if I used it regularly.

9278,"NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Bluray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the ""show all reviews"" link and then sort by ""Newest First"". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review: First off, I have always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this. The film looked ""okay"" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the then new featurelength documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been ""restored"". Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film almost four times!. The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Bluray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and highdef of the special features. So if you do not have a BD player yet you will not miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away.

9289,"Steelheart released their sophomore record ""Tangled In Reins"" in 1992. While the chances of the record making it big were slim, that did not stop Steelheart from cranking out a buttkicking party rock record.

I will agree with some reviewer's here that said ""Tangled in Reins"" is not as good as the debut album. They are correct in some ways; however, this record is definitely worth adding to any popmetal collection. With their sophomore album, Steelheart dropped some of the overthetop campiness of the debut, and simply went for a more straight ahead rock approach. The change works well for the band on this album, and as with the debut, Michael Matijevic's vocals steal the show. ""Tangled in Reins"" does not have that ""I will Never Let You Go"" type of hit on it, but the harder rocking approach adds a breath of much needed legitimacy to the band's repertoire. Songs like ""Sticky Side Up"" ""Loaded Mutha"" and ""Late for the Party"" are favorites of mine, but the rest of the album is not totally terrible either.

I would recommend this to all fans of the late 80s/early 90s melodic rock scene.

""I Believe"" 3/5 : She starts out beautifully!! But then she starts going off on vocal exercises and the ""yea yea yeas"" and it tends to make the song less enjoyable. Plus, this song shows her vocal limitations. She cannot hold notes for very long, and that is very evident here.
""Chain Of Fools"" 4/5 : Fantasia's take on this song is very fun and upbeat. She does a really nice job on this Aretha classic!
""Summertime"" 5/5 : Fantasia's unique voice REALLY makes this song shine! This is the infamous song that Randy hailed ""The Best  Performance on Idol"". Her voice is effortless in this song, and it is just as good as her live performance!

9297,"So I ordered this case with high hopes.  It was perfectly clear to show off my sexy new metallic blue HTC One.  It was immediately clear when I received it, however, that something was wrong.  I read other reviews that described their cases as ""used"" or ""dirty"".  I do not think that is the case though.  I think the clear version of this case is made out of a strange TPU that is prone to oxidation.  My perfectly clear case was extremely hazy on the inside phone side when I received it.  I polished it with a micro fiber cloth and all the haze went away pretty easily.  After a few days, however, it was back.  Another polish, another few days then back it came.  The shape, fit and feel of this case is great, but I am afraid the clear version just is not manufactured properly.  I uploaded some pics to try and show the difference between a polished side of the case and the unpolished side.  Likely be returning this case in the near future.",Great case,I really wanted to like this case :-\

I did not see a  substantial improvement in my shave until I would been using it for more than a week  but I have seen a marked change.  My shaves are more comfortable, and yes, much closer. Enough to say that I do not get a ""five'o clock shadow"" anymore, and that I can actually get away with not shaving every day.  The one drawback is that my skin is a bit dry and I need to use more moisturizer when I am using this product daily. But it does a terrific job removing dead skin and flakes.
I am on the fence about the scent  initially it smelled kind of lemony, but that dissipated and was replaced by something a bit more plastic as I continued my was. I may like it more after I have gotten used to it.

9326,"Let me preface this review that the JLab Bluetooth Earbuds I purchased were intended for a very specific purpose, and though they did not work for me, I do not think this is an indictment on the product in general.

I purchased these solely for running with an Apple Watch and no iPhone.  I loaded my music on the Watch, fit the earbuds in my ear, adjusted the back strap, and off I went.  At first, it was a disaster.  The sound clipped in and out, endlessly.  So, assuming that the bluetooth module was on the right of the earbuds, I switched my watch to my right arm.  Better, but still not perfect.  So I decided to remove the cord clips that shorten the cord length, again thinking that maybe the bluetooth module might hang down lower without obstruction if it was not close to me neck.  And again, better, but with my arm by my side, still the music cut out.

At that point I had to give up.  Sound is great, fit is good, ear clips are average, but bluetooth range for the Apple Watch which was not an issue with the Jaybird X2 was the killer.","Good product, good fit",Poor Range with Apple Watch

than what the critics in this town have to say,"" and that, frequently, was true in the case of Leonard Bernstein.
It comes as no surprise that Lenny's discussion of Beethoven's
creative genius in making the ""Eroica"" is informative and insightful.  Bernstein was the most masterful teacher of music
we had.  But the real revelation here is his performance of this great work.  It crackles and sings with vitality and is devoid
of the stylistic excesses Bernstein indulged in late in his career.  The pacing of the movements, the shaping of every phrase
and the weight of the dynamics all blend perfectly to make this
one of the best ""Eroica"" symphonies on record.  It outshines Solti's, and is so much better than Karajan's, both in its pacing and in its clarity, that to compare the two recordings is
just silly.  Only Toscanini's 1952 performance rivals this one
in its faithfulness and brilliance.

I Am going set aside the debacle that followed the launch of Evolve and concentrate on the game since it went FTP, which is when I started playing it it was on my wishlist and I probably would have bought it eventually. Coop gaming lives or dies with the team. They can be great fun to play provided you have a decent team, but if your team does not cooperate, or is poorlymatched, well, it soon goes down the pan. In this respect ES2 suffers more than most. If you are lucky enough to get a cooperative, wellmatched team of hunters, against a wellmatched monster, it can be really enjoyable. If you do not have such a team it can be extremely frustrating, especially if poorlymatched hunters are pitted against a highlevel monster. Due to the low number of players it averages around 400 at the time of writing there is no matchmaking to speak of and teams are often badly balanced as a result. There are also too few players who enjoy playing as monster which can lead to long waiting times. And yet despite all of these gripes I keep going back to the game because I love coop, and when it does go well it really is a satisfying game. I think Turtle Rock missed an opportunity with Evolve: there is the basis for a really good game here but, for whatever reasons, they dropped the ball. And I can understand why many people lost patience or grew bored with the game. But if you enjoy coop, and have a little patience, EVOLVE STAGE 2 is worth a try.",3.5/5 I've decided to take the game on for something like this,Survival of the mismatched

I saw my cousin play the old Playstation version years ago and was unimpressed but for the Gamecube the graphics have been rerendered to absolute lifelike perfection. The shadows, the sound, the ambience and those thunderclaps...all highly, highly realistic. Play this with your Gamecube hooked up to your home theatre. And like me, you will totally jump out of your skin at the scary parts many of them. My main hint is conserve your ammo. If you see a zombie, put it down right away no funny stuff and burn it. Take care of them one at a time. And if you do not burn them they will soon come back as Crimson Headsfaster, deadlier, scarier. Much like the Myst series, Resident Evil is one of those games where you have to keep your eyes and ears open. Clues and puzzle pieces are scattered all over the place and you need to pay attention. Do not be put off by the size of the mansion. After a short while it is easy to get your bearing and find your way through rather easily.

9363,"I just went to a local seminar hosted by an estate planning law office this week and found out how much better a living trust is if you have more than $100K in assets that includes the equity in your home, but not IRA, 401k, or life insurance value. If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catchall, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up note that was plural. The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That is huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription. The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that is understandable for a local law office. But put that into a wellrespected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process.

They actually mean that you should drill with a 3/8 bit, to a depth of .400 measured the part with calipers before I installed. DETAILS I usually use Fender/Schaller style straplocks on my guitars and have never had an issue with those, other than the nut that holds the top half to the strap can come loose but when it does it is typically obvious before you would ever have an issue. You tighten it with a socket on one side, and an adjustable wrench holding the other side and it will stay tight for a long, long time. The only problem on an SG the strap lock is on the back, facing your stomach, and the Schallers stick out about 3/4 of an inch, and poke you in the stomach. Or possibly worse if you like to hang your guitar more at groin height. Can I get a snare hit? Dual design Dunlops also stick out too far, really, on the SG. I tried those first but finally came back to the Flush Mounts, and in the end I am very glad I did. However...

9373,"Thank you Ron Howard! Obviously you touched a national nerve with the outstanding ""Apollo 13,"" and took that concept and extended it into this wonderfully filmed and acted semidocumentary account of the NASA of the 1960s that was seemingly unstoppable. In this film the actors do yeoman's work, and come across as the enigmatic guys they were: serious yet pranksters; competitive yet team players; in command yet able to follow orders. The beauty of this, of course, is that is exactly the truth. Conrad and Bean come across as great buddies, Armstrong comes across as a hypercompetent, serious and retiring test pilot and everyone else seems similarly true to form throughout the series. My hat is off to the actors: they nailed it. Another favorite feature of the series for me is the evenhandedness, rather than an almost exclusive focus on the 'Biggie' missions Apollo 8, 11, and 13 that are most commonly dealt with in film. They are adequately addressed, but so are many other equally dramatic events that seldom enter the public's consciousness. A perfect example is the depiction of the stuck thruster incident encountered by Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott on Gemini 8, in which a thruster sent them tumbling in all three axes, and which became so severe that only Armstrong's quick thinking was able to salvage the situation before they blacked out due to excessive G loads. According to some inside NASA it was this quick thinking that earned him the CDR spot for Apollo 11. Of further note are the special effects, which, similarly to ""Apollo 13"" are excellent. Try watching the Gemini 8 segment on a big screen TV and not feeling queasy and nervous. Overall a super job.

It is a pattern that takes place over roughly a decade wherein a new Zelda game is released to universal critical and community praise, then scrutinized, then bashed, then loathed and hated as ""the black sheep"" of the series, then reevaluated and slowly accepted again, until the final step wherein it is viewed as a beloved cult classic. For a long time, admitting you liked Twilight Princess was a statement you had to qualify and justify to others right now it is Skyward Sword's turn on the hobbling wheel, judging by internet comments anyway. Not now though, because we have finally gotten to the point in the Zelda cycle where Twilight Princess is now rightly viewed as a high quality classic. The same thing happened to The Wind Waker as well, which is now universally loved, and rightly so Wind Waker is my favorite entry in the Zelda series, which is my favorite game series of all time. For the record, I have loved Twilight Princess since I first played it roughly a decade ago, and my love for it has only grown each time I have played it since which is about 5 or 6 times with a couple completionist runs in there, and I have played both the Gamecube and Wii versions. It has always been one of my favorite Zelda games. Now that everybody is generally on board in liking the game, it is the perfect time to release an HD remaster.

So with that, I have tried a variety of different feeders with some working better than others in their design and durability. So I was definitely interested in checking this out to review to see how this bird feeder performs. This particular feeder is made of a lightweight clear acrylic that you can attach to a glass window with 3 large suction cups that allows you to watch the birds feed up close and personal. In the shape of the house, it is a nice attractive design with the perch inset about a half an inch into the feeder. I do think the front of the roof should be extended a bit more a half an inch maybe to better protect the seeds from the weather and maybe a few small drainage holes of some type at the bottom to prevent water buildup would be beneficial. The feeder opening is large and works for both larger and smaller birds. Although I have learned never to say never when it comes to squirrels accessing feeders, unless a squirrel has spidey powers and can climb straight up the wall of my house on the second floor, I am fairly confident they will not be able to access it. As some reviewers have indicated that they have not attracted any birds with this, the one thing I",Awesome feeder,Nice way to see birds up close and personal
9391,"I have been raising Bonsai for over 30 years and misplaced my 30 year old concave cutters. My plants needed pruning and I thought I would try this set until I can locate the concave cutters again. I knew not to expect bells and whistles, but these tools are subpar.

To begin with, as I was unpacking the heavy duty shears, I got a nasty little cut from one of the handles at the point it should have been touching the base to complete the loop of the handle. All points such as described, are very sharp, unfinished edges.

The concave cutters are utterly worthless and the main reason I purchased the set. I do not know what other reviewers were cutting, but it crushed and splintered the branch I was attempting to cut. I had to cut through the 1/4 inch branch NUMEROUS times, just to finish the job and it looks horrible.

The knob cutters are sharper and they are OK, but nothing more than that.

This should not even be considered a beginner's set, because a beginner should have good quality tools. This is just a very cheap set and as the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for.""

This set is being returned and I will buy a new concave cutter from a reputable Japanese Bonsai supplier, not ones made in China.",I'm still a beginner and will get what you pay for,Worthless as real Bonsai tools

9396,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully...They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2.I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here do not make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads ""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful"". Not that these are not great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early daysfor example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles work, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuffbut I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan! The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is topnotch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch. My only criticism of this album is that it is a bit long.

John Cleese also appears in the role Robin Hood. This wonderfully imaginative film follows a boy who gets caught along with a group of dwarves on a journey of time travel.

Clearly, AWLaughing, big grin or laugh with glassesoR is the best, most refined AW game to date, and so far, it is the best strategy game I have ever found for the DS. It definitely deserves a full 5 stars, as I have been glued to it nonstop for about a month. If you enjoy strategy games at all, pick up this title, you definitely will not be disappointed. And yet I have to admit, I am a little disappointed. The two major improvements were to the touch screen control system and to the online capabilities, both taking greater advantage of the DS platform. Unfortunately, I am just not that interested in either advancement. I do not use the touch screen for this game at all, I definitely prefer the direction pad and buttons though I have to admit, the touch screen option is very well done and fun to use. I also do not use the wireless options of any DS game. It is not that the wireless options are bad, just that I prefer singleplayer games in general as there is no need to coordinate schedules, no delays at all. The DS in particular is an excellent system to fill dead time during bus or air travel, neither of which work well with other players. The multiplayer options of this title are actually very tempting not only can you compete against your buddy in another location, but you can voice chat while doing so!, but multiplayer gaming just",Best strategy game I've ever found for DS,"Best tactical strategy game on the DS, but just shy of perfection"

9434,"Even before its official release, Fiona Apple's third disc was widely hyped as a victim of recordcompany cluelessness, a la Wilco's ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.""  The story of ""Extraordinary Machine's"" recording, partial rerecording, and final release is familiar to most people who care, so I will not repeat it.  What is worth noting is that unlike the Wilco ""Extraordinary Machine"" more than justifies the hype.  Stylistically, Apple is a cabaret artist; she blends cabaret's emotional openness and intimacy with pianobased, bottomheavy settings for added expressive power.  The two Jon Brionproduced tracks, which open and close the CD beautifully, stress the musicaltheater aspect of Apple's talent; the rest, produced by hiphop guru Mike Elizondo, go mostly for the ""heavier"" sound.  Apple's material  toughminded, wryly funny songs on the theme of romantic disaster  has enough dark undercurrents and graceful melodies to support both sonic approaches.  And her conversational contralto delivers her lightly bitter yet unbowed lyrics in a perfect deadpan.

9442,"I Have been using TurboTax for many years to file my returns, and had always been satisfied with them prior to this. I Have used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that I Have had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and I Have generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee. This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product. First, in some situations Intuit will not let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless you have paid for the current years product. I cannot remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is do not just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records. The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I could not file because a particular form was not ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but EFile on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for EFile, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available.

9483,"Changeless is a fun followup to Gail Carriger's brilliant Soulless. Once again we join Miss Alexia as she hunts down the because of a most outrageous outbreak of 'humanisation' amongst London's supernatural set. All while dealing with an errant husband, a most irritating entourage, and a fabulous, but most unfashionable, parasol. Alexia remains her wonderful prickly self, and we are introduced to an array of very fun new characters notably a rather flamboyant millinercuminventress, and the story expands on some favourites from book one Biffy and Tunstell both show up a bit more here; and I think Biffy is rather Spiffy. I loathe Alexia's sister, Felicity, but I rather than that is the point. Also, where DOES Miss Hisslepenny GET these hats? As many have noted, the book ends on an huge cliffhanger, and I would not like to be reading it while having to wait for book 3. Do yourself a favour and make sure you have it on hand. While I would prefer a nice tidy ending a la book 1, said cliffhanger involves events which are only plausible, and, regardless of how I feel towards certain characters' behavior and reactions, all parties in question do act true to type. I suppose it had to happenI just wish it had happened in one nice, neat book. I am not a fan of this kind if ending, but I am a fan of Changelessonce I look past the last 5 pages of the book. Lastly, everyone else has said it, but it bears relating: do not read the blurb for book 3 before reading this, and please, please, please, whatever you do: do NOT read the last page of this book first I am looking at youyou know who you are.

9491,"I have used Roxio's products for years, starting with Easy CD Creator 15 or so years ago.  They had a really good product back in the day, as well as a pretty good video editing component for home movies to DVD, but over the years each new upgrade brought more and more problems and their technical support unit never would help you unless you paid them a fee.

While not directly relevant to the review of this specific version of the software, it does set the stage for this version as I was apprehensive about trying it in the first place.  To put it in a nutshell, it had a heck of a time trying to install on a Windows 7 machine  it would not install at all and the software aborted the installation after about an hour of trying no kidding.

I did go to Roxio's online support board because they will not answer a phone, and I saw a list of similar issues / complaints from other customers.  I was unable to resolve the issue and am no longer trying to install the software.

At least Roxio is consistent with their software product and lack of customer support.  I am very glad I received a review copy vs. paying the recommended retail price of $99 or even one dollar for it.  I would give this one a wide berth.",Good product,Stay Away and Keep Your Sanity

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",Just a little bit of work,Eats Lint

9507,"I have been using pomade or similar types of hair product since discovering it as an alternative to LA Looks hairgel back in high school. Pomade gives hair a good hold while avoiding the helmet hair look and feel of the 1990's. My current product of choice is American Crew and I am directly comparing Crew's product versus the Baxter of California. PRODUCT: The Baxter Pomade comes in a heavy glass container that some will probably find more of an annoyance than anything else. I tend to leave my hair product on the bathroom countertop in the mornings and my wife already commented that she almost knocked the container off the counter while using her hairstraightener. Other than the container the product has a slight pink hue and has a distinctive floral scent. Applying Baxter's pomade for the first time is interesting... the product had sort of congealed into one mass and took some pressure to dig any amount of the pomade out. Once started though it was easy enough to get more pomade as needed. HOLD STYLING: The pomade blends into hair easily enough. I apply pomade to slightly damp hair and the Baxter is as easy to blend as the Crew brand that I traditionally use. Baxter's pomade dries clearly and does not give a wet appearance to hair. Hair remains soft and does not feel oily. I had no problems with this pomade holding my hair in place all day. Though I have relatively short, thick hair so this should't be much of an issue for any decent pomade product. WHAT I LIKE: Does exactly what it is supposed to do hold hair without feeling oily or leaving residue or helmet hair WHAT I DISLIKE: This is marketed as a premium product and it is priced accordingly...",OSHASH FOR THE HOLD STYLING,Premium Product at a Premium Price...

9528,"When shopping for wrenches, sure finish and more importantly fit are important.  If you compare say Snapon top of the line to Craftsman barely a step above made in china, you will notice the snapon fits a fastener just slightly tighter, meaning less wobble, meaning less chance to slip and strip.  As far as finish goes, snapon is a work of art, polished beautifully, got them all beat.

Next, comparing the quality of steel, which I had the opportunity to do.  I gave a single $40 snapon socket and one from a $20 craftsman set to a metalurgist.  I do not remember all the jargon he rattled off but, I do remember he said much better much stronger.

Next, how is it feel in your hand while being used.  I compared side by side snapon, matco, craftsman, and sk on a very tight bolt with a 15/16 inch head.  The snapon and matco both looked EXACTLY the same except for the name on them.  I pulled really hard on the snapon, the harder I pulled the more it flexed and failed to loosen the bolt.  Same result with the matco.  The craftsman I pulled, then harder as the sharp edges dug into my fingers, until I surrendered.  Then my sk I pulled harder than I did with the craftsman, then the fastener moved and loosened.

Lesson learned is the thicker sk wrench did not flex, so the force being applied by my hand was not being wasted into making the wrench flex.

It is this reason all my wrenches, at least most above 10mm are sk.",I like the solid sk wrench,thick

Yeah, not the most original story but like Lunar, it is sort of a story that makes sense given the graphic style but you kind of wish there was a bit more deepness than this.

While sprites are not the most detailed, it is certainly a very bright and colorful game and there is a few anime cutscenes interspersed throughout the game as opposed to just an intro/ending duo.

The only problems I have had have been occasional dropouts for a second or two. I believe this is related to the fact that, in my apartment building, there are over a dozen reasonably strong signals competing on the 2.4GHz RF band which this also transmits on. You can download free apps online on your computer such as inSSIDer which shows you how many people nearby are clogging up the band and which part of the 2.4GHz spectrum they are using. It is probably worth changing the pairing settings if you are having trouble to get the best connection. There are three to choose from in the SAir menu: A, B and C, representing the three nonoverlapping 2.4GHz channels, 1, 6 and 11. If you have WiFi at home on 2.4GHz, I would set the wireless router to the channel at one end of the spectrum and the SAir unit to the channel at the other end e.g. SAir set to A, wireless router set to channel 11 to minimize interference.

The fabric is similar to that of a khaki work shirt. The sleeves are lined with sweatclingy fabric, when they ought to be unlined.

9570,"THE QUICK TAKE: Instant Immersion Spanish offers a lot of content for a reasonable price. Like all language programs, you get out what you put in it takes work. This package is a reasonable option if you are looking for a lessexpensive way to start to learn Spanish. FULL REVIEW: Instant Immersion Spanish has a number of features that reflect their experience in offering language programs: There is a diverse range of content and different ways to learn, which is important with language: computer software, tablet software for Level 1, a DVD and audio. A PDF of the audio script is included, so there are written materials as well. I like to see the words, not just hear them. This new version allows multiple members of a household to use the software. In my opinion, that is essential for language software, so each individual can pick up where they left off. The software can be installed using a download, which is very helpful for the newer devices that blur the lines between tablets and computers such as our 2in1 laptop with no optical drive. The tablet software is fairly nicely done, though it could be a little better. It offers a few different learning approaches listening, speaking, spelling, multiple choice. I find the tablet in our case, an iPad works particularly well with children and easy to pick it up and get started, anywhere. No need to sit down at a computer. Of course, it makes me wish it covered all of the levels. But there are some concerns: The DVD seems to use Spanish as it is spoken in Spain, rather than in Latin America. While the differences are modest, that is a surprising thing to do to new learners. The DVD lessons are OK and worth doing, but",QUICK TAKE: Instant Immersion Spanish offers very nice content and different ways to learn,Multiple methods to begin learning Spanish at a reasonable price

Unfortunately, after the barrel designer finished his/her job, the person in charge of hoses and hardware screwed it up.  The clamps are too small and very cheap....... you will need to purchase proper clamps from a hardware store.  The drain hose is cheap and too small.

The blackest black color is wonderfully rich, yet the product just wobbled off at the end as I opened the cover. I thought perhaps it was an error, or it was damaged somehow. As I touched the piece that fell off, I noticed it is very soft, which is understandable since it is advertised as gel. As I touched the piece that fell off, I noticed it is very soft, which is understandable since it is advertised as a gel.  And I applied what was left exposed from the pencil to my lash line, and I found it looking very nice.  However, as carefully as I was trying to apply it, product would find itself under my lower lash line, and it would not remove. I tried make up remover towelettes which have very good emollients, yet after two towelettes I could not remove the black.

I was guessing that because a gel needs to dry well before setting,  I would be able to remove what was underneath my lower eyelashes.

All Microsoft's smooth scroll wheel mice are extremely irritating after about a week of use. The resistance becomes uneven and it is difficult to scroll smoothly. The experience for me is like scratching your nails on a chalk board. Microsoft usually says nothing in their product descriptions about the scroll function of the wheel.

When Cam arrives at home he finds Shay, his wife, and one of his best friends Jacob in a passionate embrace, Cam kicks j
Jacob out telling him that Shay is his wife.

Even though he is back Cam is a changed man, he is violent and has almost duel personalities but Shay thinks he s suffering from PTSD from what he went through but rather than say anything to anyone she keeps it to herself living every day in fear of which one of Cam is with her that day.

9621,"I am in love with this conditioner. The foaming aerosol device is fun and easy to use. I have to use conditioner daily since I have very silky, straight hair that tangles really bad. My biggest issues with conditioner is that I use WAY too much. I do not really mean to, it just comes flying out of the bottle into my hand. I waste a lot of it. That does not happen with this aerosol foam formula. I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It does not feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.

The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I did not notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles.

We have not yet seen the new Monsters University movie, but are very familiar with the original movie, so it was really fun to play with this book and enjoy the new characters while learning about nouns, verbs, and playing scaring games.

The only reason I did not give the book a full 5 stars is that I think the 3D feature is really neat, but the glasses are really flimsy, and I wish the book would have had a little pouch to store them in when not in use.

9635,"I have been a regular user of Adobe Photoshop for over 10 years. I still use Photoshop for most of my quick image editing jobs because I am very comfortable with the menus, layout, and image corrections. But last year I added Corel Patinshop Pro X5 to my software list. I ended up loving the HUGE set of plugins and oneclick image enhancement macros. This year's new X6 edition adds even more plugins! So when I want to make my photos uniquely different I play with the dozens of different macros that Corel has. As you will learn, some of these same plugins for Adobe Photoshop cost more than the Corel software! So it is a deal in itself! The biggest improvement that I noticed in the X6 version this year is the better menu system. I am starting to get a lot faster using Corel. This gets me using the software more often. I will be curious to see how much I continue to use Adobe Photoshop as the year moves forward. The bottom line is for under $100 you cannot find a better image editing program! For those shoppers looking for image editing software, my advice is: If you only edit images on occasion and just want to resize, perform white balancing, or leveling then GIMP is a free imaging software that will work for you. GIMP is fully loaded with all the fundamental correction abilities that a basic image editor will require. And the software is free. Keep in mind that GIMP runs slower than Corel and Adobe... and does not have the plugins or cool macros. Of course you can also use the online editing tools like Flickr and Picasa.

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

I was hesitant, promises to lock in moisture, I figured this meant still greasy at the end of the day.  I have combination skin.  My skin is fairly sensitive, I typically avoid harsh perfumes.  My tzone is oily and everything else is dry, flakey, and peels.

I washed my face with a gentle exfoliator.  I used 80 aloe vera and my Nuface.  I washed my face again with a chamomile bark, I patted my face dry, I put a small amount of Vichy on my face.  A little goes a long way.  The scent was strong in my opinion but it fades quickly, and did not because my face to feel that burning sensation normally associated with strong perfumes.  After I put the serum on  which is a thick, milky cream that spreads evenly, I let my face air dry a little and put my regular day cream on.  At the end of the day my face still smooth without feeling overly greasy.

I did wash my face again at night with an oil based cleanser, pat dry, put on serum, air dry, put on night cream.  In the morning my face was very smooth and still youthful and dewy.

9659,"DUST MY BROOM: Boozoo Bajou made a bit of a splash hadeha a couple of years back with DIVERS, a skanking reggae refit that found its way into a lot of DJ boxes, and ended up featuring on their debut SATTA album. SATTA was a mostly mellow, fairly lowkey affair, appropriate when you consider that ""satta"" is a Jamaican term for ""sitting"", often used to indicate meditative repose. Where the debut album was mostly made up of shimmering, dusky instrumentals with occasional voices floating by deep in the studio mix, DUST MY BROOM employs various guest songwriters with predictably mixed results. The tantalizing pairing of sound system legend YOU Brown, and Fat Freddy's voice of milk and honey, Joe Dukie for TAKE IT SLOW ends up being rather pedestrian  nice, but no revelation  while DJ Top Cat really mashes up the firing KILLER in fine style. Elsewhere, Tony Joe White lends a suitably menacing voiceover to the opening KEEP GOING, while Ben Weaver tries much too hard with a third rate Tom Waits impersonation that borders on embarrassing. Willie Hutch is sadly underemployed with the forgettable TREAT ME, but Wayne Martin, making a return appearance after a cameo on SATTA, fares much, much better with the lowdown, slowburning blues number, MOANING. The remaining instrumentals are gems, especially the atmospheric interlude, BIWAK, and the frosty NINE BELOW ZERO. All in all, DUST MY BROOM is a decent effort with at least a couple of outstanding highlights  worth checking out.",DUST MY BROOM 'Pasty Delightful,DONE & DUSTED

9666,"Had this keyboard for a few months and was loving it for the 1st month.  Its SOLID, keys are quiet yet firm. By the second month I started to notice the S key was showing wear, by the third month the S was rubbed off, and the A key began to show wear...  Here I am 4 months later looking for another keyboard because the W in now rubbed off, and D is next W,A,S,D.
I had a cheap $19 M$ keyboard that is been going strong for 3years and even though you can see the WASD wear the letters are not faded in the least.  A keyboard manufacturer clearly marketing to gamers, should anticipate someone was going to game with it.  I find it inexcusable that the paint rubs off the most popular keys in the gaming industry, and you should to.

9667,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still was not enough so Ill end up spending $60 dollars on this kit which is not terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....that is overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you are not an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cannot be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Do Not force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. 1 You have a large bend in your duct or 2 you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE as you have probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint you have broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum",Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit which is not terrible if you factor what I would get charged out of town,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

Yes, some parts were original, nicely shot, yes, there was some good acting, but darl comedies have been better filmed before, like ""Happiness"" for example.

They have good reasons.
It is expensive for a SINGLE use hand mask.
That is right: you are paying $10 for one disposable treatment.
You can justify it by saying that a similar treatment in a spa might cost 25 times more.

1. You must tear mask at the seam.
2. Wear the gloves
3. Secure the straps
4. Add the massage oil
5. Wear 1020 minutes or longer for intense treatment.
6. Throw everything away.
7. Do not wash away the residue. Let it work its way in.

I used to be so afraid of playing this game alone seriously, it is not scary, I was just a really sheltered kid I used to be so afraid of the gruntydactyls flying dragonlike enemies, with big noses, that I would have to pause the game and wait for someone to come sit with me. The game has a dark undertone, but primarily focuses on humor using jokes and funny phrases... I mean, one of the characters is named Jiggywiggy!

Anyway, it is a fun, timeless game! I am a bit disappointed that Nintendo gave it up to another company, it would have been cool to play it over the Nintendo Wii...

I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for an older game to play, again, it is one of the best!

So far, I have not had any trouble feeding it or printing with it.  The only thing I can find fault with is that it changes color.  That is, the color of the roll is a bright, glossy, red.  Printed objects, however, are a flat, faded, red color.  This is not a really big deal, but since I do not bother painting anything, I like to have several different colors on hand to fit my preference.  Previously, I had a DaVinci printer that required use of their proprietary filament.  In this case, the printed object color was the same color and gloss as the filament, bright red.

It is possible that the nozzle temperature is too high since I am running it at the Lulzbotrecommend temperature for ABS, 240 degrees.  The maximum IC3Drecommended temperature is 230.  I may also check out other filament brands to see how they perform in my new printer.  For now, IC3D seems to be of good quality and reasonably priced.",Not for printing,Seems To Work OK

9714,"If you are like me, then your favorite way of listening to music is to listen to an album start to end and have it move you at it is roots, and intrigue you throughout. Besides that, the whole album must be content filled, and pleasing. This CD is one that I can listen to over and over again, start to end, and never think about turning it off. I also like this because the studio is seen as part of their instrument and style. They utilize the tools in the studio to create the sound they want, which is not that tightly engineered, flawless, fake sound that comes out of most studios today. This may well have been recorded in his parents family remember Rudy Van Gelder and I would not know, or maybe I would, but I would love it more because of this. Anyway, enough blabbing... The Shining is just simply beautiful, a masterpiece nontheless. But that does not mean you should overlook really cool and fun songs like ""This Song"". People who think music does not always have to be serious are my friends, and they definately accomplish that. Also, the musical, nonlyrical interludes make the album a joy all the way through. You can just sense the bands depth and vastness througout. And how diverse... To me the album makes me wonder what Beck earliest works would sound like if he were born in England, and had a real studio. Or better yet, what about Burt Bacharat weird huh, Beck, The Beatles, and Xavier Boryer of Tahiti 80 would create in a studio in Omaha if they did their own engineering.

9723,"Among Splash's lineup, this is the case that provides the least amount of protection.  The only reason I wanted a case was to protect the camera lens with minimum impact to usability of the phone.  I do not care if the rest of the phone gets the usual dings and scratches.  So this case does the trick.  Since its thickness is 1mm, that is how much space it gives you between the camera lens and whatever surface you place the phone on.  It was setting the phone atop and sliding it across hard surfaces that scratched up the camera lens on my iPhone 4, so I did not want to make the same mistake again.

There is virtually no protection on the front of the phone.  The back is fully enclosed and protected, with the exception of a hole for the camera and flash.  The sides are also fully enclosed except for openings for the buttons, connectors, and whatnot.

The case fits securely and dimensions are spot on.  The material feels like silicone in that it is lowfriction, so it is easy for me to slide the phone in and out of my pocket.  Yet when I am holding the phone sideways as a camera, it feels more secure in my grip than it does without the case, probably due to the extra gripping area.

It includes a really nice screen protector.  However, I failed at applying itI got a bunch of dust underneath it.  The dust sticks to the screen protector and once it is there, you are doomed to a lifetime of air bubbles.",A beautiful case to protect the camera lens,Minimalist case

9733,"The best Pixar score I have heard from their glorious period of the ""naughties"". A lot of it is ""occasional"" or ""travelling"" music, rather than anything more structured, but it is absolutely delightful. Part of this comes from the sheer loveliness of the playing, including a section of more than 50 violin players. Sumptuous sound! See the wellinformed review at allmusic.com. Particularly beautiful is playing from a bank of harps, not to mention the massed flutes.

And that is not to mention classic cuts from Louis Armstrong, and a broadway show. That show has been described as mediocre, but the music fits extremely well into the context of the film, and serves to set a romantic and optimistic mood.

9746,"This CD is amazing, Thug Life is definitely one of the geatest rap groups of all time. The group consists of Syke, Macadoshis, Mopreme, The Rated R, and of course 2pac! Every song is outstanding these guys are for real. Some people complain that there is not enough songs, but that is because there is no filler, no skits, just 10 great tracks which is plenty. All the songs have hardcore bangin' beats that go perfect with the group's hardcore rapping style. Any 2pac fan should definitely have this album, but do not sleep on the other members they are all sick. My favorite song on this album is ""Pour Out a Litte Liquor"" a solo track by 2pac which is one of his best songs ever.

9749,"I have purchased 3 of these dual meters. All work fine. However just for the heck of it, I put all 6 sensors in a single bucket of water after calibrating them and they vary by more than 10. TDS of the water was around 220, and the sensors showed from 200 up to 220. The description claims 2. But that is a 10 range. So it is not as accurate as claimed.

Also during calibration I could never get both sensors to read the same, they were off by 10 points between them.

9774,"I have been running OS X on my G4 Powerbook for over a year now, and I love it.
Jaguar 10.2.8 was running great so there was no stability reason for me to upgrade. Basically I just had to have the latest version just because it is the latest type of thing. Yes the system is quicker and there are some useful features such as expose, but I am not sure it was worth the cost of the upgrade.
If Apple is planning on upgrading OS X every year then I probably could have gone along with 10.2.8 with no complaints and done a upgrade on the next version. I think Apple should have offered a upgrade version for those with 10.2 for about half the cost of what is charged for Panther. To pay full price for a OS  you expect major changes, like from Windows 98 to Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry.
So if you are happy with 10.2 and the new features in 10.3 are not something you need then I would stay with your current version and see what comes along next year.

In the overview, I make mention to useful references and its numerous improvements over the 2012 issue. This should enable small businesses to decide what their company needs. One of the questions I wanted to know about the AutoCAD Revit LT was what exactly was included in the subscription, something that no one at Autodesk seemed to know. One benefit, that I found by default was the outstanding access to technical assistance. I went online, got myself into a queue and received a call within minutes. Back to the subscription plan before I head off into specs and feature of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 in comparison to the AutoCAD LT 2013. There are three levels of support that Autodesk offers via subscription: Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority. The subscription included with the purchase of this particular version of AutoCAD Revit LT is the Basic. If you wish to upgrade your level, you may do so by contacting Autodesk directly, purchase online, or through a local Autodesk reseller. This was one seemingly simple question that took me several weeks to get answered. As I mentioned before, the web and phone access to technical questions is prompt and excellent. All software, regardless of subscription purchase or not, includes what is called UpandReady. It does include installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables. You will also receive phone and online resource support.

Having the option to vary font sizes and even have multiline text is great!

My only skepticism is related to the tapes this machine use and their adhesiveness.

I do not know why it is, but I constantly had to raise and lower the volume. I have not had this problem with any other DVD, so this was a real disappointment for me.

Graphics:

The graphics are AMAZING. You can see textures in the clothing and reflections on the storm troopers armor. even small objects reflect light different depending on the angle. In the first level you walk through a tunnel with windows on the sides and it is pouring rain outside. The effect on the water sliding down the glass is one of the best water effects I have ever seen. The graphics are crisp and vivid and convey the look we have come to love from the Star Wars movies.

SounTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry

Sound effects are awesome. The voice acting is pitch perfect and you would thing you are watching a Star Wars movie. The cut scenes are UNBELIEVABLE!

Gameplay:

Building upon the first game's gameplay, a a resounding success. Better force powers. You always feel in control, the force push and force grip are one of my favorites. Launching stormtroopers in the air, Mind tricking them into attacking their comrades or committing suicide, or simply impaling the with your lightsaber while you lift them in the air never gets old.

Story:

Mindblowing. It explores on the gaps between the movies and events take place in the Star Wars universe following Star Wars cannon. If you are a fan, you will enjoy the story line.

Its format is such that importing a GED from other genealogy software often leads to loss or of data or data being improperly located. For example, personal notes may be converted to ""Events"" for some reason. There is lower rated genealogy software that is easier to use and often can import data directly from another application. I have been doing genealogy research for at least 20 years during which time I have used many genealogy applications.

After removing it and reapplying it a second time, all hope for a clean install was lost.

I had some sort of cloudiness on the film but it also would not go down correctly regardless.  The irony was that I cleaned the phone perfectly before applying it the first time but I guess the static electricity from the deinstallation process contaminated the second install.

9826,"I purchased this heater to use in my cargo trailer/camper at high altitudes.  While I have not been camping this winter I use the heater to warm an 8' x 12' insulated she would at home altitude 8600' on low, with outdoor temps in the single digits it keeps the building comfortable.  It is rated for use at altitudes up to 12,000 feet, there is no odor and it uses very little propane!

My only complaint is that there is no standing pilot or way to regulate temperature thermostat it is either off or on.  There are three settings, but that is it.  I guess this is due to the design of the catalytic pad and a small tradeoff for such a great heater.

This heater is well constructed with quality materials and I expect it will last a long time.  I would not hesitate to buy another and highly recommend it.",Great heater,Great Heater!

9837,"Notwithstanding Paulsen's overuse of punctuation which made smooth reading awkward, I enjoyed the early part of the book.  Early in the book the reader is treated to the stepbystep painstaking hand manufacture of a rare ""sweet shooting"" American Revolutionary War rifle.  Indeed the rifle falls into service against the British enemy and serves well.

Having secured reader interest and established a fine starting base, Paulsen now rips his mask off.  Using a convenient ""lost in the attic"" tool, we time warp ahead a couple hundred years to current times.  The American population now appears to be littered with guncrazed lookingfortrouble fools.  Indeed the noble War of Independence rifle has now become just another filthy instrument of death.  Paulsen nakedly suggests some equivalent between rabid progun idiocy, and love of Jesus Christ. I am not kidding!  A stupid and insulting generalization.

In the end this primitive black powder gun, which has been loaded for 200 years, discharges while hanging over a residential fireplace mantle, penetrates a couple of walls through and through, and shoots the boy next door in the head. Another stupid contrivance.

What a shame to turn an initially entertaining and potentially very educational young people's novel into a crude leftwing antigun propaganda rag.

9840,"I am rather fanatical about all things Disney so I jumped at the chance to read this book. I enjoyed the author's journey through her many careers at Disney, the company's philosophy and how things are handled in the Disney parks.

The writing style is very easy to read. What I appreciated about this book is that the author uses several darkened ""asides"" pages to expand on something she is describing and every paragraph prior to one of those asides ends in a complete sentence. I hate it when you get something like these little asides and the thing pops up right in the middle of a paragraph! Then you are left with the dilemma of finishing your sentence and then reading the aside or stopping to read the aside and forget the point the author was trying to make because you left off in the middle of a sentence. However, that is just me.

I agree with other reviewers that I wish this book had more anecdotes about the author's time at Disney. I would think that could fill a book in itself! I realize this is geared toward self help but I still wish there was more Disney interwoven among the pages. That said, I went through the phase of ""one more chapter before I go to bed"" several times and wound up staying up into the wee hours to sneak in a little more Disney. That says something about the book and the author.",My favorite Disney book,Enjoyable read but I want more Disney stories!

9853,"Gosh what can I  say about these pencils? I do not know enough superlative to do them justice. Seriously these pencils are the BOMB and no other company has anything close to it for comparison. These are similar to watercolors in that you activate them with water but there the similarities end. These are actually ink in pencils form, so keep that in mind when using them. They are permanent once they dry which means you cannot rewet them and move them around. That might seem limiting but it also open up new possibilities. You can layer to your heart's content without worrying about disturbing the color underneath just make sure to activate all the pigment first!.

The colors are vibrant and intense, much more so than traditional watercolors. You do not have to press hard on the paper or do many layers to get vibrant colors. These are great for adult colorists who want to experiment with WC but are put off by the translucent nature of watercolors. I can finish a page much quicker with my Inktense than any other medium, except markers of course! I do not have to go over them with colored pencils to bring out the full effect as I find myself doing with watercolor pencils. Overall a great medium if you like working with intense pigment/inks.","Works well with the colors, but they are not a good medium.",Best introduction to wet art mediums

9889,"I love this epoxy. It bonds quickly once wet, and it has a pretty good hold. I like to use it with the underwater epoxy putty from the same company: I mix the putty, pour some CorAffix on it, and then immediately put the frag in place in the tank. The hold is great after a few days.

A few lessons I learned the hard way, though. First, this stuff will bond skin to skin once wet. If you notice immediately which I did, thankfully, you can easily separate the bond and just peel the CorAffix off a few hours later once it dries. Some CorAffix ran down the side of the bottle and I took off my gloves when putting this away and did not notice the spill. It stuck two fingers together after two or three seconds of contact, but I easily separated them and all was well.

Second, this stuff bonds fast underwater and that means if you use too much, you will get a trail of CorAffix hanging off your bond like a sweeper tentacle. Be sure to use an appropriate amount and, if you want, use fragging scissors or something else to cut the excess trail off do not pull on it, you might pull the bond free.

Overall, I recommend this product to others. As I mentioned, though, I prefer to use it in conjunction with the epoxy putty.",Great for a week,"Bonds fast, hold well, but wear gloves!"

When I switched from my Vox AC15 to a 68 Deluxe Reverb, the Twang King was not cutting it anymore, it was just too ""flat"" sounding. After reading about a lot of pups I figured I would try a noiseless single coil because, why not? I do not think I have ever heard a bad Dimarzio pickup. I have definitely heard bad Duncans and others so I rolled the dice on the Dimarzio. Pros: Perfectly clear and balanced sounding, very similar to a Fender Twisted Tele but with more warmth and a touch more mids, just a touch. There is no dullness or lack of feeling from this pup at home in my quiet apartment, I cannot imagine being able to discern a difference in a live setting. This pup gets raved about for a reason, it is great. Con: Just 1 con, Dimarzio ships ALL their pups, regardless of their height, with these SHORT springs instead of tubing to mount the pickup. I do not care that its a spring and not tubing but they ARE TOO DARN SHORT, DIMARZIO!! The Area T neck is TALL so when you use these SHORT springs you literally have no adjustment range whatsoever; they are either right under the strings or flopping around. I ended up using some old rubber tubing to extend the springs. There is a simple solution Dimarzio, make the springs LONGER. That is it. Since a spring can be practically flattened, unlike rubber tubing, make it LONG and it will be FINE. Sorry for all the caps but the boys and girls at Dimarzio can be a stubborn lot. Their customer service can be downright abrasive but they",Great tele neck pickup!,All the Tele neck pup you'll ever need

9932,"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years olTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",Good product,Eats Lint

9942,"I am a professional musician, keyboard player, and keyboard collector mostly vintage poly analog, but also a ton of mono phonics, modulars, and built your own kit units shrugging, ambik etc not that that has a lot to do with a pedal, however, I do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that I use to make my living. have purchased every brand and style of pedal for the purpose of this, we will stick with sustain.. Compared to other units, it is heavier than most and I find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic. It is just an on/off switch, so no half modeling here, The only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20 of the market who will get home and , if they had not thought to check, may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed. A backward sustain pedal is not fun. Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse switch that would eliminate that potential headache. These days, most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on, you may very well because an issue you do not expect and are confused by turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases. So build quality, excellent. Durability excellent I have had a bunch of cheaper pedals used on stage break at the switch point or at the jack, this Yamaha endures.

9947,"I bought this to replace the battery for my US Cellular Galaxy S2 SCHR760 which is pretty much the same as the Epic 4G Touch. The battery in my phone had the same model number as the one pictured. The battery in my phone was not original. At some point I had utilized the US Cellular now defunct battery swap program at one of their stores to get a freshly charged battery, so who knows how much abuse the battery had received prior to me receiving it. A few months ago, I noticed decreasing battery life and the occasional screen flicker followed by a crash. A couple weeks ago this became an every day occurrence whenever I would play games, and eventually the phone could not be on for more than 5 minutes without it happening. The phone would only function normally while connected to a charger. The battery was noticeably bulging and was giving off a pretty strong odor. I have read that this could be the result of heat damage, but I do not leave my phone sitting on my dashboard or put it inside of my oven. I did occasionally plug my phone into my Nexus 7 charger which does provide more juice. This is something I do not plan to do again in case that was the reason why my battery was damaged. The battery from Amazon arrived in a simple plastic wrapper inside of a small, formfitting box. It appears to be the exact same as the battery in my phone minus the bulge and smell. There are no apparent signs of previous use. I installed the new battery in my phone and it powered up right away.

9950,"I spent quite some time looking for the perfect car mount for my new S4 that would also accommodate my phone and not leave me broke. Pros: Inexpensive Love the Rubber grip inside the clip so as to not damage your phone and make sure it is held securely Love the fact that it accommodates my phone and does not stick out far when the phone is in it. Since it is a clip and not a whole apparatus, you can center your phone and make sure it is not interfering with any ports or buttons which was another problem I was running into while looking for mounts. Since it is a clip it also allows me to keep my case on, which was hard to find one online that was as accommodating Cons: It is Cheap, I tested its strength a bit and, just be careful things can snap if you are too aggressive, you do not have to baby it either, but just keep in mind that it is not really sturdy, it is adequate The nut that attaches to the suction cup is hard to fasten/adjust when the phone is in it, and hard to adjust ""period"" The suction cup does not really seam to want to stick to anything at times and at other times it seems inseparable When applying this to the dash or window the lever has to be in the down position, and then you pull up on the lever to ensure a strong connection.

9955,"With their last issue for Blind Pig, Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King have probably produced their best effort so far. No many concessions to any other gender here, just blues as it should be played. I personally believe that the combination between the two different styles of this two guitarist works very well giving to the sound of the band a very distinctive flavour. The more aggressive and aloud stile of Joe Kubek that recalls to me something in the between of SRV and Albert Collins finds a fantastic counterpart in the more jazz infected and relaxed stile of Bnois King. Bnois vocals are excellent throughout the entire album and the rhythm section plays its part in creating a fantastic sound. Having said that all the 10 songs included in this CD are equally good and that I do not think you will be tempted, during your listening, to skip any of them, I would like to mention ""Standing in my door"" a slow blues in which both of them have the opportunity to show us how their different styles could be blended together with fantastic results.",Excellent rock sound,Texas blues at is best.

Also, being a ""semi""portable / compact designed unit there are no reasonable places to clamp jigs, guides, etc. and the fence is too flimsy to clamp to. The saw is still a bit heavy for a portable50 awkward lbs. If you are moving it a lot, you will probably need to get or build a stand with wheels. The last complaint is that the miter gauge is pretty lame and could function better in the miter slot. On the upside, it is well built overall. and most parts are high quality. When all parts are secure, calibrated and aligned it cuts like butter. Summary: if you are doing basic jobsite cutting this saw would be hard to beat.

She could not do anything with her computer without a popup coming up for something she did not want or her mouse intermittently becoming unresponsive prior to running that scan and cleaning out the malware files. That free program picked up 645 issues, but I felt like she needed something more so I bought this Premium version.

This version works quietly in the background and can be installed on up to 3 PCs with a 1 year subscription. Setting the schedule to automatically update the program is something that is done when the product is installed.

I suggest going into Settings, then Automated Scheduling to Edit the automatically set times. For me those were set to times when I have powered down my PC. I would also suggest adjusting for two scans a day 6 hours apart versus one a day. The scans do not tax the PC's resources so they should run quietly int he background.

I like that this program adds an effective layer of protection to my PC. It is userfriendly and works as expected. Along with an antivirus program, it offers great security and peace of mind. Highly recommend it!",Awesome!,Adds another effective layer of protection

I have just a few observations I would like to share with the author not that she will ever read this: What is the obsession with rape all about? Has any woman ever been the victim of so many attempts without actually being raped? After awhile, it is just one big yawn ""I see you have got yourself into a fine mess again, Stanley."" And we get the passionate marriage thing, but do you have to drag us through every detail every night? Ever heard of leaving SOMETHING to the reader's imagination?

All of a sudden, the bass began to appear and tighten.  The highs began to settle in, and the stereo stage began to widen. It sounded better and better the more albums I played.  At Around 50 hours, it began to really hit its stride.  This cartridge can really sing!  I have been playing predominately Jazz music with it and I find that some times I cannot wait to hear my next LP.  I highly recommend this cartridge to someone who wants a taste of High Fidelity without paying a very high price.
NOTE: my previous cartridge was a Shure M97xE, while many others found it to be an outstanding cartridge, I found it to be a little to layed back.

I am gigging 34 times a month and find that the soft case allows pedals to shift so much during transit that they come loose from the board.  The padded flight case would hold pedals down more securely.

But there is more to the problem. First, the Velcro is not anywhere near strong enough to hold down heavier pedals e.g. a Digitech Whammy, even a CryBaby, which come loose even when picking the board up to put it in its case. I have ended up using cable ties wrapped around the crossbars to augment the Velcro.  Second, the glue on the back of the supplied Velcro is not strong enough to stay attached to many pedals.  I have ended up using Gorilla glue to get the stuff to stick.

I am not sure there is any solution to these problems, since any pedalboard would have the same issues.

Having said that, it is a good solid pedalboard, probably the best available.","Solid and sturdy, but didn't work properly.",Only if you're a garage-rocker ... otherwise get the hard case
