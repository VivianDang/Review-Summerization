30,"Janet Morris has a loveaffair with the histories, cultures and mythologies of the ancient civilizations, and she brings this love to the genre of Heroic Fantasy Fiction with this wonderful story. Characters such as Tempus, Niko and Abarsis are richlydrawn, memorable, and iconic. All the action, human drama, and pageantry of the ancient world is portrayed in Wizard Weather with the loving eye and hand of a true artist. Janet Morris has a fascinating way of taking us on a voyage into the world of mythology. I loved reading about these characters she has created and put them into her captivating story.

33,"We have had these over a year now. My daughter is 7 now and still enjoys to play with them!

They are simple figurines and they do not make any sound.

This set includes a Graham and Rescue Bot Boulder figurine.

Graham does not move

For Boulder:

The arms lift up and down and can turn in a complete circle. The wrists can turn in a complete circle.

While you can somewhat bend each leg...you really can only move them at the same time up and down...or have the legs standing and lean the rest of the body forward and backward.

The only other part that can move is the head also in a complete circle.

I have posted pictures with some other random toys I personally like to have size comparisons when purchasing stuff online, so hope it helps some Happy face or smiley

34,"I bought this pen to use in my small home office.  The smaller size and rectangular shape of the pet pen works well in smaller rooms like my office where a larger playpen would be overwhelming. My tiny poodle pup used it from 10weeks until she was fully pottytrained, so it was only used for a few months and was still in great condition when I gave it away. I set up 3 playpens in the rooms I use most frequently, and took the puppy with me from roomtoroom placing her in that room's playpen.  So, while she was mostly confined to one playpen or another, she was not unsupervised.  Collapsing this particular pen was very difficult and it was impossible to fit it back into the carrying case that came with it. When I finally gave it away, the carrying case was alongside it, because I never could stuff it back into that case.  This pen is durable, but I can recommend it only if you want to set it up and leave it in place.  If you have the space for a larger pen, I highly recommend the Graco child playpen our Graco has seen 16 years' service with no rips in the netting which is much easier to put up and take down, stores, cleans and travels easily, and costs about $20 less.  We still use the playpen now that she is fully grown.  We take it camping to keep her safely confined while we sit outside, to motels where she needs to be confined, and we take it visiting when we do not want her wandering their house or yard unattended.","Nice little pet toy that works well for small!!.! for for the small pet pet, not for larger cats!

45,"It works great regardless if you use from scratch batter or the dry pack. Cleans up in dishwasher, you need to clean it with a brush before putting it in the dishwasher This is some what disappointment compared to pressure steam cooking. The outcome product is OK but my wife will not eat it. I am from Northern parts of India where we do not make idlis and other South Indian dishes at home. But I am a big fan of South Indian delicacies. They are delicious, easily digestible and on top of all, maintain the nutritional value of the food.

I have never cooked idlis at home and decided to give this idli maker a try. And I admit that I failed terribly first time but learned a lot from the mistakes and since then, I have never had to go to a restaurant to enjoy the idlis.

THE GOOSadness
1. The quality of the plastic used is very good and it does not smell when you cook the idlis for longer duration in microwave owen.
2. Each plate has four slots and there are three plates so you can effectively make 12 idlis in one go.
3. The container as well as the plates are easy to clean and assemble.
4. There is a small vent at the top to let excess heat escape the container so that one does not get hurt by accumulated steam

THE BAD not exactly!!:
1. Having some way to secure the lid with red bottom container is desirable.
2. A handle on the top or small flaps on the red bottom vessel would make it easy to remove the whole setup from the microwave easy specially when its hot after cooking.
TIP: Make the batter a little thinner and try making small size idlis. They cook approximately in 712 mins depending on the thickness of the batter and the power raying of the microwave oven used.

In short, I would say this is the best 20 bucks I have spent in buying any kitchen item !! I CAN SUURE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET GETTING THIS IDLI MAKER !!!","It works great, but it doesn't!!.!,!

47,"Got this to replace an inexpensive Timex digital watch.

This is ... OK.  Given the cost/etc., I was not expecting much, and it delivered that for sure.  It keeps time, is not too difficult to set similar to other inexpensive digital watches, really.  I have a largeish wrist, and it just fits barely, but it is comfortable, so no complaints there.  I got it specifically for the larger time display  after cataract surgery, I need reading glasses to be able to read printing/etc., and at night without my glasses, it was impossible to read the Indigloilluminated Timex numbers.  This is a lot better, as long as the light stays on long enough.

And therein lies the problem.  The light on the dial stays lit for 1 second when the bottom button is pushed, but you can change it to illuminate for 3 seconds and it does not matter how long you hold down the button  just tapping it or holding it down, you get 1 or 3 seconds depending on teh setting.  OK, GREAT!  That is just what I need.  Except that the button you use to change the illumination period is the same button you use to switch from ""regular"" to ""military"" time or reverse you know, ""13:00"" instead of ""1:00pm  the button on the lower right side of the dial.  To change the light setting you press and hold that button for 2 seconds, and a little ""marker"" shows up to tell you you have succeeded 3"".  Unfortunately, it also switches the time setting.  No problem, just press the button once quickly, and you are back to your preferred time setting.  Unfortunately, this then causes the light duration setting to switch back to 1 second  but not right then.  It waits until the next time the time shifts from 12:00 to 1:00 or 13:00  and it shuts off automatically.  I have tested this 3 times now with the watch off my wrist, so I know it is not caused by accidentally pressing the button that activates the change.  This makes it difficult if you change the light setting before hitting the sack before midnight  and then try to look at the time, say, at 3Happy face smiley0am after the light setting has changed back.

This may seem like a minor thing, but it was one of the major reasons I purchased THIS watch  lighted dial, big numbers.  I do not use the other features stop watch, etc.  I just need a watch I can wear andread in the dark.  If this is not a concern for you, this might just be the perfect ""everyday"" inexpensive watch.

The search continues  This one works fine for day use, but I will likely have to spend a little more to get excactly what I need.","Not as good as I thought, but it,, not not, only, ( ( but not as fast as it should ), and and then then, a little bit too slow, then just a bit bit longer, to have the unit digging bone pawn recruitment presentations pairs uncle Rapid Wholeographic Regulation Base gunshot","Not bad for an inexpensive watch, but ..."

58,"This does not work for ceilings. The suction from the shop vac caused too much suction on the pad making the sanding strokes almost impossible because the head was suctioning to the ceiling. The head has an adjustable vent, but I still had too much suction even after adjusting. Took the pole out and tried to sand just using the head while standing on the ladder. I still could not get the proper leverage to overcome the suction and effectively move the head across the ceiling wallboard. I ended up using my old wallboard hand sander and putting up with the dust. This dust free drywall vacuum is such a great idea I really wanted to love it, but it just did not work for me. This sander works great.  I went with the nonpole version to allow for a range of sanding circumstances and I have been impressed with how well it picks up mud dust as it comes off walls and ceilings.  You have to be careful to adjust the amount of suction I have a 5.5 hp contractor ShopVacor it will suck the screen too tightly to the surface and you will end up taking more off than you wanted to  especially with a course grit.  As long as the vacuum filter is clean to allow the vacuum to draw, this sander will do a great job. Worked as well as can be expected for something like this.  It was a bit tiring to use over my head as the suction increased the friction making sanding more difficult.  I had it attached to a large 6.5HP shop vac with some serious suction power.  It was completely worth the extra effort as it resulted in virtually no dust.  I would recommend it but expect more effort.","Works great for the price.

80,"Synology manufactures some of the best networkattached storage NAS devices around, and has spent considerable resources making the user interface for their devices convenient, intuitive and powerful.  Among the software features bundled with their NAS operating system is a ""Surveillance Station"" software package, which can, when used with one or more IP cameras, turn the Diskstation into an internetenabled video security system.

While the ad copy for the Diskstations may discuss the maximum number of cameras each of the different models can accommodate, it may not make clear that, outofthebox, each Diskstation has a ""license"" to use only one camera.  You simply can not connect more than one camera to the software without buying a ""license"" code for each additional camera.  Why Synology would choose to intentionally cripple one of their software titles, and charge such an exorbitant ransom to enable it, escapes me.

For example, I have anbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/DS1511/dp/B004GKLT4G/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""DS1511/a, currently Synology's flagship 5bay SOHO NAS.  According to Synology's specifications, this device is capable of supporting up to 20 ! IP cameras.  The word ""support"" here is used generously, as very few cameras are fully ""supported""  with many you will not be able to record audio, or stream a live view to anything other than Internet Explorer with ActiveX plugins.  As with every Diskstation, the DS1511 only includes a ""license"" for 1 camera.  To fully enable the 20 'supported' cameras, one would have to purchase 19 of the CLP1 license packs.  Do the math Amazon does not like people mentioning prices in their reviews, and you will discover:

THE LICENSING COST FOR THE CAMERA SOFTWARE WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE ETongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberryENSIVE DS1511 HARDWARE!

According to the Synology moderators who locked ! a discussion thread on this topic in their support forums:

""The ability to use 1 IP camera per DiskStation out of the box is for evaluation purposes and is not provided as a license key.""

Therefore, the Surveillance Station software that they advertise so proudly in the ad copy for each of their NAS devices is properly understood as an EVALUATION TRIAL COPY.

This came as a surprise to early adopters of Synology products, who previously enjoyed a copy of Surveillance Station that was unburdened by additional camera licensing requirements.  Much to their surprise, a firmware update pushed out by Synology disabled the functionality of their software, and rendered their previous purchases of additional cameras wasted.  Imagine how you would feel if you updated your Windows operating system, only to be told that now you owed Microsoft an additional $50 printer ""license"" for a device that previously functioned, and was now disabled.

Will Synology push out additional firmware updates in the future that disable additional components of their operating system?  Will they begin charging a perharddrive ""license"" fee for their multibay units?

If history is any indication, they might.

89,"This is a fantastic tool for weeding in spring, when those seemingly endless patches of teeny tiny weeds crop up after each spring rain. It is also great for weeding in gardens with landscape fabric, because the landscape fabric keeps the weeds' roots from growing too deep. The KenHo scrapes them up quickly and makes weeding in areas with landscape fabric a simple task.

What I love about it:

Handle is ergonomicallyshaped
Stainless steel blade does not rust
Bright red color is easy to find in garden
Rubberized handle has a nonslip grip

It is also good in vegetable gardening  for weeding, creating seed furrows, and planting starts.

It is great in helping you avoid that repetitive pinching motion from weeding lots of tiny weeds, and I love that I can keep my wrist straight when using it, which helps avoid carpal tunnel or similar injuries. I run a landscape maintenance business, and have all my employees carry one of these in their truck for those marathon weeding days.

Here is just a quick explanation about what eBooks are, "" From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, As a generic term, an electronic book variously: ebook, eBook, eBook, ebook, digital book or eedition or a digital book[1] is abookpublication in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on computers or other electronic devices.[2] Although sometimes defined as ""an electronic version of a printed book"",[3] many ebooks exist without any printed equivalent. Commercially produced and sold ebooks are usually intended to be read on dedicated ereaders. However, almost any sophisticated electronic device that features a controllable viewing screen, including computers, tablets and smartphones can also be used to read ebooks. Nowadays, both print as well as ebook selling is moving to the web. For instance, in the United States of America more ""books are published online than distributed in hard copy in book shops"". The main reasons that people are buying books online are prices, comfort and selection process. Notwithstanding that most people appreciate higher regular ""bricks  mortar"" bookshops, ""yet almost every single one of us is buying books online"".[4] Based on this information it is almost certain that the epublishing will soon overtake traditional publishing.""

96,"I am a Ryobi fan, do my own lawn, seen several good cordless products out there, read these reviews before purchase.  I purchase my last 2 lawn products here on Amazon.  Hell, I even know the family that owns Ryobi and am friends with them so I am bias however after contacting them, they do not have a 40v lithium/cordless to be developed.

I owned the Garden Turbo cheap combo that came with 24v NCad battery  it was sufficient to start.  The blower was 8/10stars  lasted for 15 minutes of leaf/debri blowing. I put the 4 star review on that here on Amazon. Here is the product link:

[...]

I own the Greenworks Extended hedge trimmer so I had the expensive 40v lithium battery already and that product is sound.  This blower is weaker than my 24v NCad powered Turbo Garden blower $140 for 3 tools compared to this 1 blower $180.  The blowing power is about 40 less and the blow width is much narrower which prompts me to swing/sweep the nozzle over the same area 23x more times.  If your leaves spread out across 20 feet  the nozzle covers a spread of 12feet max then it requires much more attention.  Another poor design is the dial 15 power that is not necessary for real gardening, only for detailed work.  Lawn/yard work is not gardening, you want to finish quickly and clean things up.  Dialing from zero to 5 each time is unproductive. The quickly on/off switch of the Ryobi's blower is excellent design.  The Turbo was activated with gripping the handle so it is instant...like the way it should be.  Dialing with a finger may not sound laborious however there is not one yard work tool done with only 1 small muscle. Pruners use entire hard, spade uses palm/grip/shoulders, most are major grips or muscles.  Imagine dialing a rotorary phone 15 times in a hour while laboring outside in the sun...it is stupid.  Greensworks blower has a narrower tube/tunnel to encourage more force which is not optimizing its strong lithium battery.  Motor is subpar.  I regret buying this because it is weak performance compared to my older/previous/weaker motor blowers, plus now I have to spend time reselling on ebay.  If you are doing your own yard/lawn, this is not worth the money. If you need something for dog hair and very light/little clean up, I recommend other brands that are better and less expensive: Black n Deck, Ryobi, anything.  In summary, if this was the 1990s this would be a latest technology product.  However even the 1990s technology I had NiCD powered is better than this.  The competition's products are 40 better AND 35 cheaper.

I found this review very helpful because he has owned/used other Greenworks/brands and is a professional that yard works every day. He needs his tools to work well, work effeciently, and make him productive:

I am a handyman and use cordless tools on a daily basis. I purchases 4 of the greenworks 40v tools and they are lived up to the hype except for this one. It does an ok job. If you already have some other tools and batteries then you can purchase this blower without the battery and score a good deal...that is the only way its worth the money. It does not blow at 150mph..it does not blow at 100mph either...it just does an ok job...get it if you have other greenworks 40v tools and batteries and if you have a small area and are not in a huge hurry.","Not bad for the price, but it ',, only, not,.., less than a half - power power, no no blow blower, and less power is added.

98,"good value for the price.. Arrived a little bent up but the steel, or should I say tin is pretty thin so I was able to bend it back into shape with my hands. I was not expecting much when I purchased this as I was not going to use it in the shop or overload it with heavy tools. I mounted the top shelf upside down so the top shelf was flat and mounted our key cutting machine on top. This only weighs about 20 lbs so it certainly does not overload the unit. We keep key blanks and other key making supplies on the cart and it serves that purpose well. I doubt this cart would hold up in a more severe duty application in a garage or woodworking shop where it was in constant use. The metal is pretty thin and would not survive the impact of dropping heavy tools or being banged around the shop. But hey for under a hundred bucks, what do you expect?","good value for the price.

Megaman Legacy Collection

Please Leave Thought Comments Down Below This is a great game, fun to play. Classic megaman, you cannot go wrong. I love this. Its a bit different playing it with a ps controller versus the old NES controller but you quickly adapt. Still a great experience. If I have one gripe, it would be that I wish all of the 8 bit games were on there and not just 16, or if I were being extra greedy, all the 8 and 16 bit games since the games are tiny compared to what a ps disc can hold. But all in all, still a great collection of games to play be you a new or old player of the megaman series.","Great game, great value.. not great,. A,, A A Great Game, Great Graphics - -.

104,"A simple yet fun game! If you are looking for a simple  usual game of sports like badminton, beach volleyball, etc, this is the one! This game had become a daily game for me. My 65year old mum enjoys it too, especially when playing it together with her kids  grandchildren. Simple to use  do not have to worry about finding the venue or the time the selected venue closed for the day. Just on the TV  console  you are ready to play! I definitely recommend it! If you worry about using only one hand to play, you can always challenge yourself by pitting your right hand against your left hand with two remotes like I did! Hee Hee!

It is easy to put up and is very light weight. So I have given this one to my son to take on his monthly boy scout campouts. It takes up less space and adds less weight to his backpack so it is a perfect use for that. The material is a strong nylon type sheet that is good for camping as it dries very quickly.  It all folds up and is easy to slip into the attached pouch that is sewn on to the side. At each end are a hook and knot that you cinch the cloth up the side and then you can slip the hook through the loop under the knot and pull it tight. The hook then easily attaches to a loop in the hammock strap of your choice. Both set up and take down are quick and easy. We got the dark green colored one and love the way it looks as well.  I have multiple light weight hammocks and this one is the first I have gotten that is made like this. It is effective and works though. I think I prefer the texture of the parachute material in the others though.

I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This opinion is my own and is in no way influenced by this discount.

121,"No wonder so many people  have game this game and its expansions One star.  There is a major bug apparently that causes ""some"" users to get stuck on an infinate loading loop when trying to load a neighborhood/world in the game.  Nothing i did fixed it. uninstalled, reinstalled, redowndownloaded, cleared cache, even reinstalled WIndows, Nothing.

turns out it may be a bug specifically for the origin version of the game. Even if you use a non origin Sims 3 base game version and install apparently ANY of the origin expansion packs i.e. those downloaded from EA's origin platform it will get stuck.

Its terrible when a nonlegit version of the game works better then the legit one!

the problem is now i doubt ill be able to get any sort of refund because i technically did not buy the product from EA and i doubt Amazon is going to give me a refund.

I will demand one anyways just saying something like EA customer support did not help as i am sure they will not be able to since i did  EVERYTHING myself to try to fix it on my own

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AS A DOWNLOAD AS LIKELY YOU WILL NEED ORIGIN TO INSTALL IT AND THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE WHAT YOU PAID FOR SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK!

no wonder so many people hate EA!

I think i will NEVER buy another downloaded product by EA again.

and i am not a fool, i am good with computers i know how to troubleshoot and look up information on the computer, the game simply will not work.

126,"Not a light garden use only tool. It was made in Austria to be used on the small farm. The carbon steel is good quality and holds an edge well. The serrated teeth allow it to cut very thick weed stalks by using a sawing action. Caution, the tip is very pointed and it is easy to poke yourself in one hand while using it in the other. I would advise blunting the tip with a few strokes of the file to avoid that.
The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the bent over tang is a bit thin and it pulled out when I rared back to cut a heavy stalk. I was probably using it wrong. After refitting it into the handle  and bending the tang back over I use the sawing moton on heavy stalks rather than yanking back and it has never pulled out a second time. Be sure to wipe it down and coat it with oil after each use. If left out in the weather it will rust.","Good tool for the price.. not a.,. but. only not as good as it should have been designed for using the metal, but it's a good tool.

127,"These are beautiful cards.  I like the jumbo index, the design that goes to the border, and the off white center of the cards.  You should know these are very stiff.  Actually just a little too stiff for my liking, but I love the texture.  It feels papery, not glossy and plastic like.  The Italians make the best playing cards and my favorite are Dal Negro.

Something very interesting I noticed is that every card is exactly the same size.  You can see this when you square up the deck they are perfectly aligned.  I took my Dal Negros and I could see that some of them were roughly 1/100th of an inch different, possible less.  The Modianos square together like a block of wood.  You really have to hold them in your hand to see this.  These are a 5 star card as I have noted, but I still like Dal Negro better.

131,"There really is in my opinion the only thing that I liked above other security software is the email checking.

On the negative side the software is constantly updating itself which on my PC slowed it down or stopped other use.  When doing a virus check with only 25G in use it would completely stop all other use for over an hour I could play solitare if I did not change games. I lost trust if a company failed me twice.
As many users found out update version 7.0.047 is a piece of junk, I must roll back to version 7.0.462 to make the software work again.
This is the second time ZoneAlarm did to their customers or at least, me.

My side job needs me to try out many different security software and recommend to my clients, so sorry ZoneAlarm is currently out of my list.
Also, I need to call and follow up the rebate or they just think it is their money.
Although Norton is a bit bulky, their software is as good as ZoneAlarm and rebate check arrived within a month and worry free big improvement compare with past history. I went to Zone Alarm because I was unhappy with another product.  That was a big mistake.  I run VER 8  it has caused loss of internet connectivity. This is very similar to the problem that occured in July when they put out an update that conflicted with a MS Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry update.  I lost many hours on that fiasco.  This tim it did not take me as long to try turning ZA off.  Sure enough after turning ZA off I was able to connect. I run ZA on two computers one still has Ver 7 , no connection proble with this one.  The one updated to VER 8 is the one that would not connect.

A second issue is I am constantly bothered with warnings about suspicious program activity. ZA says that it does not know what to do about this but yet I am supposed to.  I bought the program to do this for me.

What a piece of junk.

At least the other vendor would talk to me and did finally offer me a free upgrade. Unfortunately I had already bought ZA by that time.  What a mistake.","Not bad, but not great.

147,"These are yummy pretzels. What is wonderful about these pretzels is that they have zero fat and less than a gram of sugar. You can eat about 20 for 120 calories, so they are a guiltfree snack.

Sodium is only 10 of your DVR, so that is fairly low.

20 pretzels are satisfying. When you are hankering for something crunchy and salty, instead of having potato chips, think these pretzels instead.
They do have dextrose in them which is a negative. Otherwise, the ingredients look okay. 4.5 stars

INGREDIENTS: Enriched flour wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid, water, salt, malt, dextrose, canola oil, yeast, soda. Superyummy, very fresh I cannot say enough good things about the GF pretzels from Snyders. I have tried Glutino and some off brand in a blue bag when the Glutino distributor raised their prices. Glutino was good, the off brand was horrid. Synders is by far my favorite. It has a nice crunch and a great flavor. I dip these pretzels in mustard/horseradish dip. I am from Pennsylvania also and pretzels of all kinds are a snack staple. I have bought these multiple times since 2011. We enjoy Snyder's snacks, especially their flavored pretzel pieces  yum!

These mini cheddar pretzels were very tasty  much better than plain pretzels, i am going to! There was just enough cheddar to keep you grabbing another handful to munch, but not enough to make your fingers bright orange. The cheese powder DID leave a residue on your fingers, but much less than many other 'cheesy' snacks.

When buying pretzels in the future, I would definitely pick these cheddar flavored ones over plain ones.","Yummy, but not as good as other regular cereal cereal,, and and yummy yrunchiesy as as they they are good, good gingerie - y y'' s - average average OOKS floz Internet special Honolulu Advisorttered 1882 metal sidespoweredalty 640 emerging",Low Calorie Tasty Snack.

"" Some of us did that""
"" A few of us did this""

165,"I bought the soundtrack last night after listening to samples of the tracks on this website and, as I LOVED the movie see my review on it, I was EAGER to own the soundtrack to one of the greatest musicals of all time, now a major motion picture. It features all of the major songs which are in the film minor ones like ""Little Lotte"" and ""Don Juan Triumphant"" have been omitted, for convenience of those who have not seen the film, with dialogue bits from the film which, fortunately, do not reveal anything close to climactic because some may not have seen the movie and bought the soundtrack, anyway just to get an idea if the film would be good; that is what I did before I saw ""Titanic"" [see my review on it]: heard the music before I viewed the movie. It is like you are seeing the images from the movie those who have seen it, of course that correspond to the song you are hearing. If you have not, you are just hearing the music and IMAGINING what happens on screen, which is great. I enjoyed the soundtrack as much as the movie itself. All the songs on it are great, but my personal favorites are: the riveting ""Overture,"" the lovely ballad ""Think Of Me,"" the wickedly dark title song ""The Phantom Of The Opera,"" the heartwarming and tender love song ""All I Ask Of You"" as well as the reprise, the soft ""Angel Of Music,"" the heartwrenching lament ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,"" the seductive ""The Mirror Angel Of Music,"" the passionate ""The Point Of No Return,"" the climactic ""Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer,"" the sad ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" performed by Minnie Driver over the end credits of the film; the only song written by Andrew Lloyd Webber exclusively for the movie and of course, the Phantom's love song, ""Music Of The Night"" the famous song from the Broadway musical, the one that everybody remembers.

175,"Having finished the main story, all of the side missions, and played a few rounds of multiplayer, I wanted to share some afterthoughts:

The game combines several different styles of play  real time strategy, hack and slash action, open world exploration, and there is even a bit of racing thrown in.  In my opinion, this is a good thing.  It keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Progressing through the main story allows you to upgrade your weapons and car along the way, and there are several secondary missions to complete that will also help you upgrade.  The main quest is fairly short roughly 10 hours but completing all of the side quests and finding all the hidden objects will take nearly as long.  As a whole, the game is a lot of fun.  The story and voice acting are good you will recognize a lot of voices besides Jack Black, the characters are likeable and the soundtrack features some great heavy metal tunes.  My only gripe about the game was the RTS battles.  The controls were confusing at first and even when I managed to figure out how to control my army, the battles felt more like a chore than something I should be having fun with.  I had a blast with every other part of the game though.","Good game, but not as good as I,,..

189,"Its a good beginners guide to day trading. I am learning this. From this book, you can get idea about what do you need to be a day trader, how to set up a brokerage account, some things to know first, looking at graphs, trading patterns and strategies, trading on margin, day trading in options, day trading on the foreign exchange market. All needed information is here. I got this book because I have started dabbling in smallbudget investing just to see what would happen. I wanted to get more information about what day trading actually involved and if it would be something I would be interested in.

First of all, the book definitely cemented my belief that I am NOT a day trading investor in style. I am more of a longterm investor.

Second, the book provided a good overview of various techniques to help beginners get a taste of the techniques that are part of day trading.

The book is missing tools and resources, though. If you are someone who is familiar with investing and wanted to get an overview of some techniques that may want to look into. If you do not know a lot about investing like me, then you might know a couple more strategies that come with day trading but you will not know exactly how to do them.","Easy to use, easy to read, and quick Quick Quick, Fast, Easy, Enlightening, Quick A Lot of of Interestss, Interesting, In Installation, And Intustructions by Fast Changing SoMB Um江cin grandfather kicks manipulated corporationnant tendencyopceded","Day Trading.

I do not have any concerns about the workpiece coming loose or kickback occuring.  The only suggestion I have for Milescraft is that adjusting it needs to be made a bit easier.  My experience has been the bolt in the curved track is not the easiest to adjust.  It appears to be binding down in the aluminum slot below the plastic that fits into the miter slot of the saw.  But other than that, it works well enough for me that I would order more should I need them. It works as advertised, but adjustments are difficult/annoying.

The set up was simple; breaking the feather boards down to reconfigure them was a simple task.

The boards worked exactly as they should have. At at $26, they were a heck of buy.  They seem to be wellconstructed and sturdy. I expect to get some good service from them.

199,"With all things that come from Leigh Ann..... I anxiously anticipated THIS book. And am happy to say...... I was not let down!!

Starting this book was an emotional read for me. Just because I know where Emma came from. That being said..... This book is ALL Emma and Will and the author did a fantastic job at making sure to let the reader know that it is a stand alone.

Emma and Will..... What can I really say about these two??? With superb descriptions and full fledged emotions, it is hard not to love them. With an increasingly dramatic plot line that had me riveted and fully invested in this story, it is easily one of my favorite books. I would venture in saying that Emma is every single reader who is had a vested relationship with a family member. Actually, I wonder if Emma is me? Her outspokenness and her no shades of grey personality really shines through in this book and I am thinking.... Emma is me!! Will is the perfect compliment to Emma. He is reticent and loyal and blindingly in love with Emma. First as a lifetime comrade then as a love interest. The conflict these two go through is enough to make you take a deep breath, a step back and root them on and pray that all is able to be over come. I love the flashes of ""other characters"" they truly does endear me to be more into the story. The author gave a lot of gusto into this story and I am willing to bet.... A lot of heart. I am sure I say this a lot but I love that the author makes this book something like a realistic fictional read. These two characters have the love of a literal lifetime and the love they have is certainly entrenched into this story. 5 stars and more!","A must read book!! I absolutely love!.!,!

I liked the way Ms. Kaye hooked her readers in so fast with Mickey racing to her coffee shop with a baseball bat when the store's alarm went off only to see a dark shadow standing in front of her shop and starts racing toward it only to remember it is almost day break and the shadow and her are the only ones up!  I thought Mickey let everyone walk over her from her business partner to her best friend as she never asserted herself enough.  Clive decides to take some time off at the worst possible time as bills must be paid and there is only breakins up and down her street and she has a unsecure lock on her door.  When she meets Artie Banks, she assumes that he is from the security agency and one thing leads to another bad situation as the one time she felt a spark of interest in a man, she learns that he is engaged!","I liked this book because she didn't t, '!!

Sure, it may not be as polished and innovative as some other FPS for the system but it holds its' own and, for that, they should be commended. I will admit, I am a diehardhardcore Medal of Honor fan myself. It was not exactly what I thought it would be, either. That is, probably, why so many are disappointed with the game.

230,"It is easy to buckle and/or snap the metal blade but it could be useful in an emergency or if used with care. Since the blade is only supported on one side unlike a bow saw the thin metal is easily damaged during the push stroke when the thin blade is experiencing compression forces. The holes in the handle allow this saw to to tied to a branch or pole enabling a longer reach which is a nice feature. Great for doing finish carpentry work not good for cutting firewood when camping.  I bought this because the back of the package said this was made for Gerber by Fiskars which is one of the best cutting tool companies out there.  I have a Fiskars saw similar to this which could cut through 34"" diameter limbs like sticks of butter so figured this saw would be the same.  This saw is absolutely worthless as a camp saw and especially as a backpackers saw.  My Fiskars had the same length blade but the handle was slightly shorter overall and around 30 lighter overall. The blade was thinner which reduced friction.  Most importantly the Fiskars saw had much more aggressive and large teeth for ripping wood not fine cutting like this one.  Unless you like to do finish carpentry work in the middle of the woods this saw makes no sense.  It would take you literally twice as long to cut the same amount of wood as the Fiskars version of this saw.  The only redeeming quality is this has a hold to put a caribiner through to hang it on the outside of your back park. Being unnecessarily heavy it still would not be the ideal saw for packing.  Now I am going to be looking for replacement blades that are thinner and with larger ripping teeth.  If I cannot find them this is going in the trash since it serves no purpose.  I am not sure if they had better blades on earlier designs or if other reviewers have just not used a good saw before but this one sucks.

Update 9/3/14

I emailed Gerber asking if they could send me replacement blades or refund my money since the blade that comes with the saw hardly cuts.  I never got a reply.  I went on Amazon looking for replacement blades with fast ripping teeth and could not any.  I also Googled replacement blades and could find nothing for this saw.  It is worthless as a camp saw other than maybe cutting small skewers for roasting hotdogs and making smores.  I do not need a saw for that.  I cannot believe they would EVER put such a worthless blade on a camp saw. This is inexcusable.  If you buy this saw you will be sorry you did unless you have never used a good saw before and even then I would think you would have to suspect there is an easier way to cut wood.","Not worth the money for this saw is a not,, not not. not as heavy as it is supposed to be.. but it's a bit too heavy for the wood or the handle.

234,"This is a great under eye concealer for those who are on the lighter end of the skin tone spectrum.  It helps reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eye, and helps improve the texture of the skin.

I have been using this twice a day for two weeks.  My dark circles are purplish in color, and hereditary thanks, Mom!.  They are not terribly obvious since my glasses hid much of the marks, except with winter pale skin.  And winter is coming.  So, when offered the chance to try this product, I decided to get it.

The cream is a pale, creamy light beige color, and goes on smoothly with the applicator.  After application, you blend it into the skin with the fingertips.  If your skin is darker or particularly pale in tone, it may take a little more blending so the cream is not noticeable.  I have to blend more than my daughter does she is really pale.  It does cover the circles, but, as others have remarked, it does not fade them or make them go away.  I have noticed an improvement in the texture of the skin under and around my eyes.  It is smoother and less crepey looking. I am allergic to most under eye creams and this was no exception.  But it seemed like a decent product.  I think the more a cream attempts to do, the more I am allergic to it. I am not sure how La Roche can claim this product reduces the dark circles.  I thought the metal applicator was the revolutionary process plus maybe the caffeine.  Not so.  It may be used as a concealer and, as such, it is not light enough for me.  I tried it several times, morning and night and found no difference.  I added a concealer on top of this product and it seemed to work better but, honestly, I could not tell if it was the combination of the two with the added enhancement of another texture.

The pigmenatclar has a smooth texture and the actual case is sturdy and of high quality.  Unfortunately, it was not the miracle to erase years of genetics, age or irregular skin tones This is a very nice undereye concealer cream.  It goes on easily, and covers well.  In fact it does a better job than anything else I have used and lasts all day.  Another majorr plus is the fact that it is unscented; fragrance is the last thing I want near my eyes.  It is pricey, though you need very little, so I expect it to last a while.  As far as I can tell, it just comes in one shade, which suitw my skin well, but a variety of shades would be nice, as women are not all one color minus a star for that. I have tried many brands of dark circle correctors and had given up finding one that would work. Most left a filmy or tacky look that was worse than the dark circles.

The La RochePosay system is different. It combines a quality concealer with gentle eye massage to move the fluid and puffiness away from under the eyes.

The concealer blends cleanly, absorbs quickly, and did not leave a trace. It noticeably brightened my skin. It is fragrancefree and nonirritating. I wear contact lenses and this did not bother my eyes at all, even when I got a little too close and some got in my eye.

Using the metal applicator to apply the cream worked well, but I found it a little awkward for the massage and ended up using my fingers to gently massage out from the inside of my eye.

After using the cream and eye massage twice a day, morning and evening, I definitely see a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.","Works well, but requires some extra effort to to, for,.. but it to conceal on the skin, and and it doesn't look to be visible, too too much sunscreen, or greasy skin / pepperard Man subfamily Federicoroninal Georgetown applies Parks fold Vega kg slide",Good concealer and under eye cream.

237,"These are great curtains although when you take them out of the packaging, they are folded so they look weird when you hang them.  That will fall out over time I am sure or maybe I will iron them.

What I am not happy about is I ordered 3 for my 3 windows and find that there is only one panel per order so I need to order 3 more.

I read other reviews that they emit smell. The smell is very mild though and not every one will notice. The smell may get strong if I put them in the dryer.
two of these will not cover a 80 inch window properly. The actual width after hanging on the rod is less than 42 inch. And when you try to stretch these on the curtain rod, they will not drape well.

242,"It is a well made hair wand but your hair slips off. It is difficult to get a curl when your hair slides around. Mine came chipped on the barrel I returned it I love love love this wand! I have used curing irons and have never been able to keep my curls for the whole day or get nearly as much volume as I have with his wand! I love that this wand it has temperature control so you can choose the heat setting you want. My hair never smells burnt after I use it either. It gives my hair so much body and volume and the waves stay all day! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and looks so healthy and shiny! This wand did come with a glove but I do not use it. The wand does get very hot but I love the fact that it has a hot free tip so you can rest your finger on the end and its not hot! Seriously the no heat tip is what sold me. I will never go back to a curling iron. At first it was a little tricky to use but I watched some youtube videos to help me see how to use it properly! Trust me use this and you will not regret it! The price was great and I like it better than any other brand. The chi runs about 65 bucks and my roomate has both this and the chi and I tried them both and loved the hot tools! Great investment! I have never used a curling wand before using this one. This one works very well!  For hair that is heavy and straight, I can walk out the house with hot Louisiana humidity with tight curls and end the day with soft curls still intact.  No complaints there. It takes a minute to figure out how to use it, if you have never used one before, but for an amateur, I did a pretty good job the first go around.

244,"Of all the ""femme fatale"" action figures I have owned and photographed, none has the appeal or realism of MAFEX's Selina Kyle! OK, ""realism"" is used with artistic license Wink or smirk but I am referring to the ability to stand as if she was midway a ""catwalk"" appropriate for this figure. To understand what that means, feel free to see any model do the walk during a fashion show. Maybe slow it down or pause when both feet are on the ground. The foot that is loadbearing shifts the hips and shoulders in a way that everything works almost like a ""counterbalance"" while maintaining the center of gravity between the two points of contact. While walking in a straight line, how the one foot is positioned other foot  is something most figures cannot do See Pictures
My basis for comparison are the handful of Revoltech, including a few ""Fraulein"" figures alongside a few Figma figures. All of witch I love. I have tried in many occasions to do something similar, with limited success.

Why 5 stars?
Although I would not consider myself a ""Batman fan"", I have a huge appreciation for action figures. I am mostly a Star Wars figure collector, but as you can tell from my Revoltech/Figma acquisitions, I make exceptions for the exceptional highly articulated, awesome, etc.. Although I loved the Dark Knight movies, I never would consider buying any of the figures. Or collecting. I believe this is an exception. I just could not passup. I am glad that I did not.

Why was this almost 3 stars?
Wrist joints!! The joints the figure came with might have been ""gen 1"" ?. They were so frail, they broke the first time I tried changing the hands. Thankfully, Amazon assisted with a  replacement figure. However, those stressed and broke too no matter how carefully I did it. I did learn from a YouTube review that the parent company: Medicom Toy does replace broken parts  but be prepared to pay for shipping. I also learned that their ""gen 2"" joints are better. Would have this stopped me from buying this figure? No. She is so awesome, it was worth the trouble. Joints may be the one ""weakness"" that neither Revoltech nor Figmas have  as their joints are pretty solid by comparison. OK, I broke a revoltech joint once only by forceful error  but otherwise, I they are the ""best"" I can think of although aesthetically not pleasing at times.. more at my Boba Fett Revoltech review  when I get to it Wink or smirk 

Who is this figure for?
Any Batman/Catwoman fan.
Action figure fan with an appreciation for high articulation/detail.
Anyone who needs a ""plastic muse"" for action figure photography

Is it worth at the price? Yes.
Where are her weapons? I am sure any other 1/12 figure's weapons will work. I do not think any other action figure will mess with her anyway, so she is OK Wink or smirk

Lastly, if you get the Batpodnbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/MedicomTheDarkKnightBatpodMafexVehicle/dp/B00LYT87G0/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Medicom The Dark Knight: Batpod Mafex Vehicle/a, this figure is a MUST.

245,"A very good GPS system that has robust tracking data and a very good interface. The ability to see driving for the past day combined with the ability to download data is great. It also has some nice features like replay and the a quasi scoring system for your drivers. It can set up alerts and other cool things to alert your fleet manager or a parent if certain events happen or thresholds are broken.

The downside to this unit is the 20 bucks a month subscription, This is pretty affordable, but I have also seen full featured sets like Zubie that are much cheaper.

The other downside is the pretty bright lights on the front of the OBD unit. At night, it can light up and constantly blink becoming a distraction and an annoyance. I had to put a piece of back tape over the front. Just FYI.

Otherwise, it is a very nice system that is very full featured, has great tracking results and great tools. it just might be a little more expensive than other trackers. So compare the features carefully for what you will need and not need. Oh yeah and those darn lights .... I had the chance to review this vehicle tracking fob and let me start by saying the idea is great, you plug this into your vehicles ODB port, which is very easy to access on most modern cars. It simply plugs in and you are done. It uses a cellular signal to broadcast it is location, speed, braking, etc. It does a good job at that.

So why have I knocked a few stars off? Accuracy, I used this solely for a period of 2 weeks, while it was running I had Google Maps with another tracking app open on my phone and monitored my speed real time and over 50 of the reports of speeding were inaccurate when traveling in residential and rural areas, most of the time the speed limit of the road was not marked correctly within the map so it reported a false positive. The device got it right every time on the interstate, but on local roads it consistently said I was speeding when I was not, and there was a variance of 10mph in many cases.  Additionally when looking at the ""route replay"" feature on the app my tracks did NOT match the roads on those rural roads, in a few cases I was driving between 2 roads, in a few other cases it had me on the next road over, the accuracy for me was NOT reliable. Perhaps I got a bad unit to test.

This IS useful to get data on your braking and driving, but after my use of this I would highly recommend you NOT use this as the judgement of whether you punish your teen, fire an employee, etc. It is simply not as accurate as it should be in my test scenarios, and I state again, I did these tests solely monitoring my own driving, I was not observing anyone else's driving and then took their word for the results, this was done carefully in different controlled scenarios. This tracking system has to be similar to the one used by Progressive Insurance to monitor your driving. I decided not to use Progressive's device when I worked out that the savings to a driver were minimal.  Now this device has a reasonable upfront cost and a monitoring fee of $20/month. With that you get quite a useful tracking system.  You can monitor your kids driving  speed, braking locations. I guess if your car gets stolen and the thief does not disconnect the device you also have a way of locating your car. You can also do things like check your car's battery.  I have to confess that I have not got around to actually installing this device and if the folks at Aware read this review, I will gladly return the device to them even though Vine reviewers get 3 months free monitoring. Why? You may ask. Well, the last month has been hellacious what with a storm coming through our neighborhood knocking out power for a week and requiring days of yard cleanup and repair in 100 degree heat. Then the hard disk on our main computer crashed. Somehow, I ran out of time to give this very impressive looking device a fair test. So, be warned, other than reading up on the device and comparing with Progressive I have not driven with this installed in my car.  Also, I have an ax to grind on the $20/month monitoring fee. IT IS SIMPLY TOO HIGH. It may be just fine for folks with regular jobs but I am on Social Security and watching my expenses. I fail to see why the monitoring on this device should cost more than the cheapest cell phone service out there $10/month last time I checked. So, reasonable purchase price, exorbitant monthly cost. Lovely system  works as advertised  be sure that this is a system you can afford the monthly charges for. If you have wanted to know how family members are driving your car, this product is for you!  It is also great for small business owners tracking employees.

Insurance companies have been using these devices for years.  It plugs into the ODB port in your car.  That is usually by the steering wheel and is part of any car made since 1996.  If you have a car made before then..well kudos for keeping it around so long!

It uses an onboard cellular signal to report back diagnostics on the car.  To receive that info, you need to be a $19.99 monthly subscription fee.  The description is confusing.  Without paying that fee you get absolutely no features.  It does not use Bluetooth or have a Bluetooth backup like Automatic or other devices.  If the manufacturer raises the price on the monitoring, you are stuck.

Once you install it, the device tracks the car's location so long as it has mobile signal.  It tracks the car and usage, not the drive.  I like that because if the kids borrow the car, you will know if they are driving too fast.  For business owners, it checks the idle time and number of stops.  That let us you know if they are wasting gas or running personal errands.  It even includes geofencing, so you get alerts when it goes near a particular location.  You can view the data from the app or the web

The maintenance features are just a way of manually tracking things like oil changes.  It does not read information from the ODB port as far as I could tell.  This device is just about tracking.

Overall I liked the product.  I did not have good experiences with support. It took days to get a response and they were confusing.  Fortunately, the product is easy to use, so my support issues were only related to the review.

A slick idea the fulfills a need. This is pretty awesome for a business or nonprofit owner. It is a fantastic way to keep track of your vehicles and mileage. It could also be a great way to track your teens if you do not know where they are a lot of the time. I am not that good with technology, so it is a little complex for me, but I can certainly see that the program is created well and set up is pretty simple. Just too tech for my small nonprofit organization. This is actually a really great product... I was not expecting it to be as useful as it ended up turning out to be. I installed this on my wife's car with her knowledge in order to get an idea of how this worked. After a few days, we looked through the data and were amazed at how accurate the reports were. It gave detailed accounts of where she had been, how long, and how she drove. I had complained to her for years that she breaks too hard and to our surprise, the software claimed the same thing! Overall, she ended up with an 80 safety rating. She had one issue where she went to Virginia Beach and got lost... I was able to pull up the AwareGPS software, pinpoint exactly where she was, and direct her on the route to get home. Really amazing...

Two weeks into the use, my wife called to inform me she thought her battery was dying, and that it was difficult to start her car that morning. I pulled up the AwareGPS website and was able to see that her car was sitting in her workplace parking lot, and the battery was a bit low. I told her I would keep an eye on it and after a couple of hours it dropped below 12v. I was able to call and warn her so that she could go out and start it up to recharge the battery. In the end, this device definitely saved her from having a issue as she was able to get over to the dealer that day and have the battery replaced.

Overall, it gives a good, detailed account of the car's trips, location, and status, as well as how well the driver is driving. It turned out incredibly useful in just the first month for a private user... cannot imagine how useful it would be to a company who needs to keep track of their drivers and vehicle. I use this on my car car when my kids drive. Knowing where they are is a great satisfaction. This is easy to plug into your car. Now I have relief of knowing where my car is.","Great GPS GPS tracking system, good performance,, and, with, ( (, only a little bit of GPS accuracy, but it's a bit bit too slow and slow in tracking, not great, does has a quick upgrade, maybe slight violin500 wear western Landsshirt Nickelodeon Virginia Interactiverielemanrrick","Really good tracker, but more affordable options exist with varied feature sets, compare carefully for best value..

247,"FUN. even better with spanish commentary!! always the game Good game I have been playing Fifa for many years and I always get it when it first comes out. This is the first time I get one with so many glitches. The online single player seasons occasionally freezes and requires long waiting time for searching for an opponent. The gameplay online also frequently lags, noticeably more than Fifa 16. The Friendly seasons also frequently freeze and you will have to restart the game and try again. As for The Journey, which I was very excited to play, it gets boring really quickly and it does not really incorporate your choices into the story. There are minimum interactions with other players and the story itself is very basic.
The gameplay and graphics are okay but there is not much improvement from Fifa 16. To Be Honest, it is all about expectation, especially with the way they marketed Fifa 17 as a huge step forward from Fifa 16, using a whole new engine and adding a story aspect, which might be why I am so disappointed. great...!!!","Good game, but not great for the first,,..!!?!.??. get a chance, and and have not to like the game ; not as much as I've already already re been watching, get overall then beast Custom Reconnaissance los Cinderella Restoration strugglingoration 1772む Falls Pradesh",Five Stars.

The other difference is that the slots for supporting the iPad in the proppedlandscape position are a little shallower, but they support the iPad mini just fine when it is propped up.

I called customer service and Ed was quite helpful.  I ended up taking the three sensors and the monitor to my car and set the system up there.

277,"This is an excellent box set for anyone who wants the best of the Beatles before the Sgt Pepper album. What a perfect way to celebrate 50 years of Beatle music in the USA. After doing an extensive side by side run through, I discovered that the two songs ""MISERY"" and ""THERE`S A PLACE"", are only available on the UK CD stereo, good luck tracking down the mono UK CD ""Please Please Me"".  These two songs did not make it on to ""Past Masters"".  Since these YOU.S. CDs are both stereo and mono on the same disc, if you want the mono versions of these two songs, that could be hard, or pricey to obtain. If you want them at all, you`ll have to purchase UKs ""Please, Please Me"". As a Beatles completist collector, I bought this box set and am enjoying it for both its packaging and the music.

At the same time, I know this is not a recreation of the music as originally released on Capitol Records.

For anyone who owns both the 2009 stereo and mono CD box sets of what basically amounts to the original UK Parlophone releases, you really do have all the officially released recordings. If you chose to selectively buy the 2009 individual CD stereo releases, I make the assumption you are happy owning your favorite Beatles albums.

If you are a Beatles collector, I hope you are happy with whatever products you have. There is much to collect in various formats as well as releases internationally.

In the end, there is going to be some sort of disappointment. That does not mean there is absolutely no value in whatever is released.

Having said that, I believe the normal or average buyer of music would be happy with, at most, those 2009 box sets and the two volumes of Capitol Albums.

As for the The YOU.S. Albums release, I Am glad all of the duophonic tracks have been replaced. I did not like duophonic back then yes, I Am old, I do not like it now.  I am disappointed that many YOU.S. oddities have gone missing though some are there.
I Am also disappointed that Magical Mystery Tour is missing, or at least, the individual oddities that are not present here. For me, there should have been a Rarities type disc included with this set.

As far as any live stuff goes, I Am hoping for that reissue of the Hollywood Bowl album, but, also any additional material that may exist at Capitol and/or EMI which is basically Universal now. A nice live package would be of interest to me.

For me, I Have had enough of the vitriol and rancor. It does not serve any purpose it really does not. Having had correspondence and conversations over the years with various Beatlerelated parties, I still find courtesy and professionalism can produce results maybe not on anyones set in stone timetable. This is a beautiful product, the packaging is the exact way the original LP's were and looks identical to the format of my Beatles Mono Box Set.  I think they should have left out the foam padding at the bottom of the container box because it made some of the CD outer boxes to stick up to where when the factory slid the inner box into the outer box it mashed some of the outer resealable plastic wrap nothing that cannot be fixed.  The booklet is very colorful and full of information and pictures.  The only complain is that I had to immediately buy the Beatles Capital Album Box Sets Volume 1 and 2 to get the original Capital Album releases thanks to some great reviews I read as the set was arriving at my door.  Some people like the crisp sound of the UK masters which are identical to the 2009 Stereo Remastered CD's but after hearing the differences on you tube between the Capital and EMI versions of the songs I had to get the American Capital songs.  If you just want crisp remastered sound in perfectly reproduced original album artwork then this set is for you plus you get the other 5 albums not released in the Capital Album Box Sets.","This is a great CD, but..,, ( (,. but, not as good as the original releases, especially, it's not the best album of the late 70 years.

287,"For some reason, books both nonfiction and fiction that are supposed to heavily feature a historical woman, have not focused much on that woman, but on everything else.  This was definitely the case with The Goddess Pose.  I agree with other reviewers that say that this was more about the journeys she went on as opposed to the actual woman.  On top of that, the book was disjointed and dense.  The latter is what kills a nonfiction book for me.  If I find it a chore to read, then I am not really going to like it all that much.

296,"I found this book very enjoyable. It is a rather long one, and perhaps it dragged on at some points, but it did not bother me at all. The author always managed to bring about some excitement after a seemingly flat chapter and i always looked forward to what is about to happen in the next corner. It is amusing and touching at times and i did not like having to put it down. The characters, even the secondary ones, were well developed. I really liked Laynie. She is innocently lovable, sweet, and caring. I loved how the author introduced her as plain and unexceptional to her family, and gradually allowed her to blossom as if we the readers were actually witnessing her transformation. The sister Beth played out her role very well too, and although she wore me out more than i ever sympathised with her, i could not bring myself to hate her, for eventually, she would do something to soften me. The characters are far from perfect, not even Laynie, but as i read on, i could imagine these people and behaviours actually existing in the time period, even today, such as Beth's conceit and jealous streaks. The author subtly built the romance up between Laynie and Daniel. In fact, the whole book is clean, and i love that as a reader i get to feel the romance yet spared unnecessary explicitness. The book is very well written, and the dialogues sound true to the period. There are some small editorial issues but not to the point of distraction. I would definitely read other books by this author.","A very enjoyable read. I enjoyed the ending!!.! I!

To prolong its life, I first wash my hair my body gets wet turn off the water and scrub/soapup my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful lifespan. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash.

310,"Tom was once a reporter, very handsome and good at his job, going to war torn areas filled with strife. All that changed the day he was up close and personal to an RPG fired from the hands of a teenager.

I was skeptical at first, a blind lawyer? How could he have completed law school and read body language? However, I was most pleasantly surprised by the book. Two sisters arguing over a coowned house, one wanting to sell and the other holding onto it with both hands...and also trying to purchase the house next door. A young man searching for his birth parents, not letting any conversation of how bad these parents might actually be dissuade him.
A murder that seems random, with no connection to any of these other things going on in the novel.
Tom's relationship with Barbara, his receptionist, which is filled with abuse and sarcasm, yet instinctively the reader knows that it is a ""safe"" way to show their friendship, even as she basically calls him a manwhore, wondering if he was ever going to get a case that, you know, actually would help pay the bills. But the sarcasm, he shares that with everyone, loving to use the verb ""to see"" because how uncomfortable it makes everyone to hear a blind man refer to visual stimuli.

And then the bullets start flying. Everywhere Tom goes, especially in respect to the property he is trying vainly to find the owners so he can fulfill his clients request to purchase. He has no idea why he is being shot at, and the mysterious calls give no answer.

Somehow, all these things are tied together, even the orphan Ian's search.
This is the beginning of a promising new series, and I hope the next book is just as interesting.","A great read, but there is nothing to,,..,!!.!

320,"My 10 year old Hayward Navigator was hanging up at corners and steps even after replacing the shoes. wings and flaps so I dug deeper to see what else might need replacing.  The intermediate gear meshed with the others but slipped easily so I added that to the list. The orange bushing looked worn so that went on the list too. The gear box looked OK but the red disk looked worn So I included that too. Lastly, I added the bumper since mine had some holes.  After assembling the unit with these new parts it runs just like new.
  When I compared the new intermediate gear and bushing to the old ones it did not appear that there was too much difference but once installed I could see the improvement before even closing it up. So just because it might look OK does not mean that it is not worn out. The gearbox stopped working after about a week.

326,"Always easy to use and accurate. Here is an update on what I have learned.
As I understand 2014 Deluxe Turbotax they did not remove Schedule D and still provide all the same forms as last year and data can be entered using the interview process or forms method and your return can be Efiled. HOWEVER if you sold stocks, bonds, options, or other investment assets and if you are using Deluxe YOU CANNOT EFILE.  In order to Efile starting this year you must enter stock, bonds, options, or other investment assets sale data using the Premier version. Some potential buyers will miss this subtle change. I did suggest that Turbotax clarify this new limitation on their web site and Amazon should do the same. It will save a lot of returns and a lot of unhappy customers. If you do not want to upgrade to Premier and pay the price look at the highly rated HR Block program for $44 that imports data from Turbotax.

An update  12/6/2014
I bought HR Block Deluxe Mac disc version for $40 at Amazon and love it. Read my five star review on Amazon's HR Block Deluxe site. This is a basic Turbo Tax package including one state.  I do several taxes annually for the family.  All of these are pretty simple and have very ordinary deductions.  It is well organized and easy to use.  It guides you through the process and does not require a whole lot of thought or expertise other than what is in the box.  I Have used Turbo Tax for about five years and found this version comparable to previous one. excellent year over year  highly recommend it as the most comprehensive and consistently accurate software in this category I am disappointedin the direction Intuit has taken with the most recent round of products.
Rather than ""Deluxe"" offering you all of the forms and interviews you would require, the word ""Deluxe"" now just seems to be a differentiating brand on the packaging. In other words, Deluxe in the context of the description on the box does not mean what Webster's Dictionary says it means.

This will be the parting of ways for Intuit and my family. If you buy the Deluxe version, rather than being Deluxe it is going to wait for you to need a form that they say are not typical and offer you a chance to buy the forms and interview required to complete your taxes. I suppose that those extra interviews will make your version ""More Deluxe"". Maybe ""Super Deluxe"".

deluxe also de luxe  dlks, looks
adj.
Particularly elegant, luxurious, or elaborate for its kind; of superior quality or refinement: deluxe accommodations; a de luxe automobile; a hamburger deluxe.

Nope. I first experienced Intuit's belligerent behavior when I upgraded my Quickbooks Enhanced Payroll last year and found that I would now be charged more to write checks and get to waste a half hour of my life on the phone getting myself off the automatic annual renewal treadmill. Now, with Turbo Tax Deluxe, the very same product I have used, and been very pleased with in years past, I find that I can only efile half of my taxes, as schedules C and D can only be efiled with an upgrade to Premier. You got me, Intuit... Classy!

To be fair, if you search out the product listing for Deluxe, it does what is described in the listing, which is great for folks that are experiencing their first rodeo. However, there are probably thousands upon thousands of people who have been using this product for years and expect to get what the product has always been. Instead, these loyal customers get a healthy punch to the abdomen. In my opinion, if you want to squeeze more money out of your regular clientele, just spit in their face up front by charging more for the product they are used to, as opposed to luring them into buying a product they think they know only to hit them with a gotcha half way through their tax preparation.

What in the world did Intuit think the public reaction to their new money siphoning tactics would be? I, for one, cannot wrap my mind around any sort of justification.

Intuit has always made great products, nothing has changed in this regard. It is their mischievous, back door money grabbing that will be the death knell for this brand. If for no other reason than to show that you will not support a company that is obviously trying to take advantage of the loyalty of its customer base, do not buy this. I do not know what all the disappointment is all about.  TurboTax pulled info from last year, I put the numbers in and it crunched them, everything all nice and pretty on the correct forms, done.

So the people with rental property, some kind of hobby or small business that makes you money, or you are a day trader or play with stocks, this is not for you as you need the next TurboTax up.

This one is for the blue collar guy that works for a living, the person that owns a home and has a 401k or IRA, donates time and/or money to charities among other things.

I did use Block's program one year and it was not quite user friendly, yes it cost less but it did not have a good user interface for me.

I do think that if TurboTax is going to make multiple programs then they should price it accordingly, make this one $30.00 and the premier could be $50.00 as to be somewhat competitive with other tax programs, if not, TurboTax may price themselves out of the tax business. As other have complained, Deluxe is now pretty much the basic package and if you have any stock or other investment income, it will not work for you AT ALL. It makes you pay $30 to upgrade.

Intuit has apologized and offered to refund $25 why not all of it? This is a huge nuisance

I would forgive them for all that, but the customer service has been HORRIBLE.
After waiting online for over 20 minutes to find out why I did not get my upgrade confirmation number, the incompetent CSR who barely said two words to me in 5 minutes accidentally hung up the phone. Now I am back in line again for another half hour...

Other years, I would have given them 4 stars, but this year is a bit of a nightmare.

What a complete and utter screwup. Excellent Tax Preparation software. I have been using it for years and never had any major issues with it and never got audited. I think it is the best tax preparation software out there. Yes you can get cheaper software, but you get what you pay for. Intuit removed Schedule K1 for reporting income from the Deluxe version after having it there for years and years and wanted me to buy the Premier version instead. I opted to buy the HR Block product instead. Intuit has ripped it is customers off again! This is NOT the same product as last year's model! They have eliminated things I need. I buy the SAME version every year because I know it is what I need. Now they take that away and want to charge DOUBLE to get what I need.
I want my money back and will never buy Turbo Tax again. You people are fools shooting yourself in the foot.

Free HR Block software if you bought TT and want to switch! I am in.

Pass the word around. Why call this ""Deluxe"" when it feels rather stripped down? The program itself works...no bugs. We have been using Turbotax for over a decade, so the similar format is comforting and familiar. The Deluxe version is stripped down and so you need to study very carefully the version comparison charts and the rabid feedback which is justified due to the unavailability of necessary Schedules without expensive upgrading or repurchase of a more expensive edition.

Good news: On 2/5/2015, Turbo Tax sent a further ""apology"" email which you might have received. Here is an excerpt:
""Beginning February 7, 2015, you can buy the same product you would normally buy, and if you need to upgrade for your tax situation, we will help you do that at no additional cost. This means you will get all the forms you need, including Schedules C, D E, and F, without paying anything extra. Learn more."" Delivered as advertised. TurboTax Deluxe 2014 Fed  State  Fed File was a very easy to use software that helped you though each step.  It was you some questions and you just enter the information.  If you had not used any TurboTax before then it creates a folder for you and places your information in it.  If you have use it before, then it will import your information for you.  What I did not like about it is that it will not efile in some cases. with stock transactions buy/sell you can no longer efile but we pay for efile. is intuit that crazy to raise the price and for some eliminate efile even though the user paid for it. why does intuit every other yer or so come out with a customer hit that costs them customers. hr block here i come. helps with taxes every year good product and easy to use This year Turbo Tax Deluxe was easier to use than in years past.  I think part of the reason might be for the very reason why Turbo Tax took a real hit this year because as most of us we just buy what we have always purchased without looking at it.  Intuit changed their products this year.  While this product in the past included home business schedules this year you had to upgrade if you had income from rental property or investments.  In years past I had stocks and bond investments but no more so the TurboTax Deluxe worked great for me.  It figured out with a few questions who I could take for dependents, in these hard times we have helped to support more people so we needed to know who we could take and who we could not.  And then of course the new big elephant in the room, healthcare.  With one or two questions that was also taken care of very easily.  Thank you for a great product that keeps on helping with these burdensome rules and regulations that are so complicated that to do it on our own would probably be a real nightmare.  I might add that Intuit sent me an email, because I created an account to tell me that they were offering  to help you buy the upgrade if you purchased the Deluxe and really needed the Premier.  A very nice gesture. As a freelance photographer, I have used TurboTax Deluxe for over a decade for federal and California state income tax filing, including Sole Proprietor Sched. C and equipment depreciation schedules.  I just ordered it again because TurboTax now says if you used TT Deluxe last year you can use it again this year and they will FREE UPGRADE you to Premier or Home and Business, if necessary to do what you used Deluxe for in the past. I had already bit the bullet and purchased TT Home and Business, but did not open the package or use it, so now I am returning it to Amazon for a refund, less return shipping.  If I had opened the package and installed it, then Turbotax offers a $25 refund as long as you use the software to file by April 20, 2015.

Clearly, TurboTax got the message from negative reviews and complaints from the thousands of angry customers who bought TT Deluxe and discovered it no longer does everything it did in the past, or read all the product details and found they had to buy a more expensive version than Deluxe.  They are very apologetic and trying to repair the PR damage caused by the sudden product change. First came the emailed apology and offer of $25 refund if you bought a higher product. Then today Turbotax emailed the free upgrade offer if you buy Deluxe and need functions not included this year. The TT chief also promises that the features we are accustomed to will be restored to TTDeluxe for next year.

I have been happy with TurboTax Deluxe every year in the past, and expect to be happy with it this year. If not, you can be sure I will post an update. I am docking them 3 stars for the messy situation and giving 2 back for doing the right thing after all. .
 Update Feb 1, 2015: I just got my 100 free copy of HR Block Deluxe Federal  State 2014. It is for anybody who used TurboTax in 2013 and wants to switch. You just send them an email with your 2013 invoice or product key. Google ""HR Block Giving Free Tax Software to Disgruntled TurboTax Users"" to see if their offer is still open and the correct email address to use. 

This year TurboTax Deluxe has removed support for Schedules C and D. You can still fill in the forms in the software and file your return on paper if you want.

I might give it 2stars, except I just got their ""We are sorry and we want to make it right"" letter chocked full of weaseltalk.

Instead of being honest about why they removed support for Schedules C and D, they say:

""However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.""

In essence, ""we did this to avoid confusion and help us be more innovative.""

Right. Rather than paying higher fees at tax preparation sites, I have used TurboTax for the past 15 years.  This year's TurboTax proves to be no less capable than previous versions, with very easytofollow questions and opportunities to claim multiple deductions.  Our situation is slightly atypical in that we do claim a minor tax credit for hosting an exchange student, but it is merely a matter of researching the correct form and you will find it in TurboTax accordingly.  For your more runofthemill deductions, TurboTax takes it easily in stride.

They also back their product by covering any errors should they arise and they update their software frequently if any changes do arise in forms/calculations.  They also facilitate importing wage/earning forms by utilizing your employer's ID along with your SSN to locate and extract the relevant data, saving you the hassle of having to manually enter it yourself.

Overall, it is a great lowcost tax preparation solution if you do not want to sift through stacks of paper and fill everything out by hand or pay higher fees at a tax preparation site.

EDIT 1/23/2015

One Amazon customer pointed out that this year's software does have limitations, and I quote:

""No full schedule C,
No schedule D,
Cannot enter K1 income,
No schedule E,
No schedule F.""

If these schedules apply to you, then please be aware that you have to pay more for it or you may wish to get alternative software or go to HR Block.  Or do it the ""oldfashioned way"" by hand.  Cheers! Now how can a review get a dozen thumbs down in less than a day and then suddenly stop?  I believe I was targeted. Seems very suspicious to me.  Anyway, my review follows.

Schedule C is missing from this year's Deluxe version. I had to purchase the expensive Home and Business version currently priced a penny less than $80 to get it. It was included last year. Not happy about that  minus one star.  There is a $25 refund available, but it is conditional and only applies if you bought the Deluxe version last year. Since I bought the standard version last year, I am not eligible for this new price gouging version.  Minus another star.  They sent an apology email to me, but that did not sway me in the least  just made me more angry, especially when they would not give me the $25 refund because of the version of TurboTax I bought last year.  I should take off another star, but it does function. So that is where I will leave it for now.  Their apology is conditional.  They are not really sorry about anything in my opinion.

I cannot envision using any other tax preparation product this year.  Next year I will not buy it if they continue this new tactic.  But I think they are not backing down in spite of all the negative publicity.  I strongly recommend Turbo Tax, but it depends on what price you have to pay. I have paid for it every year for the past 20 years or so.  I plan to switch to HB Block next year. I hate price gouging by splitting up an existing product and selling a tiered product line.

Otherwise, Turbo Tax takes most of the pain out of filing and paying taxes. It has a question and answer stepbystep style and is generally very easy to follow and understand. You can also manually fill out forms at random and skip through some areas. It imports key data from the previous year's taxes and automatically inserts routine entries such as names and addresses. Of course you can modify or delete those entries.

It is very thorough and complete and has a rigorous check for omissions and problems before you officially file the tax return. On some previous annual versions, this check has been annoying because it thought there were some omissions when there were not any. I had to create an alternative entry just to satisfy the software. In previous years, and probably this year as well, I will have to make fake entries simply to satisfy the software because somebody at TurboTax is completely misinformed or probably way out of date about the real estate procurement procedure to buy property in China. They seem to believe an individual cannot purchase property unless they go through some government approved agency. Not true. Starting in 2006, I have purchased and sold more than one property directly. I know this does not apply to most people but it affects me. If they cover it in the software, at least it should be up to date. Turbo Tax does a good job for us. FWIW, you should study those areas of the tax law that affect you. By so doing, you will be able to vet the results of Turbo Tax rather proceeding on blind faith. Good I have spent the last 15 years doing my own taxes, as my life got progressively more complicated, including tax situations that most people do not ever encounter. It is simpler now with just the SO, kids, and three jobs across two people and several states. This software is really straightforward to use. You just assemble all of the documents which you would have to do anyway and then start answering the thousands of questions that you have to answer the Tax Man every year. And then the software fills in the fields, and you get to file your return. Bingo bango boingo.

Is this software necessary? Clearly no.
Does it save me a substantial amount of time as my tax status changes from year to year? Clearly yes.

So, this is a good product for everyone? Not really. But if your tax situation is fluid or tends to change from year to year, it is probably helpful for you. Not if you are a CPA of course. Not if you file a 1040EZ or a 1040A if you file either of those, you do not need tax help, you just need a calculator and to toughen up a little. But for others, it is pretty useful. As you have no doubt read, Intuit has decided to ripoff their long time customers this year. Here is the info that they have finally decided to share...

""The change we made to our desktop products, both the download and CD versions, includes removing Schedules C, D, E and F from TurboTax Deluxe, which some longtime customers had relied on to report business income, investment sales and rental property income. As a result, you may now be required to upgrade the version of TurboTax you use even though your tax situation has not changed from last year.

Here is why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.""

They offer a $25 rebate if you filed with TT2013, TT2014 and filed both years using a CD/download version of the software  AND proceed to spend the additional $40 to upgrade to their Home  Business Edition. Though if you call them, you will likely get a free upgrade. However, this does not excuse what is blatant corporate greed, knowing full well that most people will just fork over the money and be done with it.

I made the mistake of attempting to file with TurboTax for 2015 only to have error after error with the final process. See separate review. As much as a person can enjoy tax software, I really enjoy Turbo Tax.  Every year, it is easy and straightforward.  Our taxes are that way too though  easy and straightforward.  I probably do not need this version, could probably go one step down, but better to be safe than sorry, better to have than have not ... so and so forth.

Thanks TT ...  you have a continued / continuing customer.  Especially since you put out all that effort to satisfy all those unhappy customers, one of which I was not.  I hope they are all happy now.  I definitely recommend Turbo Tax. Intuit seems to be trying to milk this cash cow.  They do not allow discounts from any seller.  And now they have split up the packages more depending on the need., but not cut the price.  Will not know how well this new version works until I start doing taxes at the end of the month TurboTax Deluxe does not work this year.  They removed ability to handle 1099 B income.  Watch out!  They have also raised E file fee for state! By now you have likely seen a ton of negative reviews and/or comments noting that the makers of TurboTax have apparently gotten a little, well, greedy.  Features that used to exist in the Deluxe level now require upgrading to the Premiere level.  Depending on how much you complain you can probably find an inexpensive upgrade to get back the features you need, but in reality it seems that plenty of people got upset at having to pay more for what they used to get or having to complain to get those features back no matter what had to be done to do so.  I am trying to be fair here in noting that for an average user, the features that were taken away from the Deluxe version of this software probably are not needed, but average is a highly unpredictable thing and many people might find that they actually do need those missing features and now they are expected to pay more to get it or switch to a competing product.

Realistically both products will not see serious use from me for a few more weeks.  Once employers make the earnings statements available I will get to spend serious time working on returns and determining the good or bad news about the tax situation for my family.  While I hope for good news in that area, I am also hopeful that Intuit will yet again learn the lessons of not upsetting their customer base.  We will see about that in future years though, assuming I continue to willing to give them a chance.

I would note that at least one competing product the HR Block application, for example seems to be making a serious push to take advantage of the possible missteps here by Intuit.  I cannot say that I blame them as it surely seems to be a golden opportunity some people might remember how ""New Coke"" helped Pepsi make inroads against their competition handed to them.

I suppose I could have come here and chewed Intuit a new one like others have, plopping a onestar review here and just moving on but I would prefer to be honest in my review and note the issues that I have with the product rather than just dogpiling on here.

I have been a user of TurboTax for many years now.  Long enough to remember more than just this current year's issues with the application and stupid things that Intuit has done.  I remember a big fuss over the equivalent of a rootkit that was installed compliments of one year's version of the product.  Apparently current management does not remember that mistake as they make a similarly upsetting move with this year's product differences compared to last years :/   Given this year's missteps, and some problems I had with last year's product, I am not sure I would remain a TurboTax user.  I seriously had intended to switch to a competing product this year that earlier mentioned HR Block software, already purchased as part of an Amazon Gold Box deal not so long ago.  I felt forced into using that product last year and I did buy it last year as I had issues with a never fixed 'bug' in last year's TurboTax software.  While last year's taxes were a little more complex for my family than a typical year, they should not have been that confusing and yet last year TurboTax caused me a lot of grief with my state tax filings and in the end caused a serious delay in getting the refund I was due.

I hope this year's version is better in that area but will not know for sure until a few weeks from now when I have all of the required paperwork in hand.  Given that I have both the HR Block product for this year and the copy of this year's TurboTax product to double check things with, I am pretty sure I will be able to efile this season without issue as one product or another will work for me I am sure.

I have installed both products and have a couple of thoughts about both that I will put here.  Both products irritated me a bit as they both wanted my personal information for product registration and/or activation HR Block wants an activation code to be entered.  Neither product was smart enough to actually look for last year's tax return files to grab my personal information from to prefill that information out.  Given that a few steps later in the process the applications both read last year's returns and import personal information from same it seems both could make a little more effort to save customers time in that area.  I can note that the Block product did not ask the questions about what product I used last year and/or where I purchased my products from.  It really does not take long to complete the information but it bugs me that I have to sit and type in information that is there for the taking if the apps used a smarter process for starting up. GET IT EVERY YEAR AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM good product and service worked just fine I have been using software for tax preparation for years. For the last few years through 2012 I used an HR Block product Tax Cut and although I was generally happy with it, last year I tried the online version of TurboTax. That experience was positive enough that I was happy to give the packaged version of TurboTax a try this year.

Although I need to wait for some additional documentation from my bank and employer before I can finalize my 2013 taxes, my experience with TurboTax this year has been even better than last year. The interface is clean and the process is intuitive. TurboTax imported my tax returns, and all my personal information, from last year's return. And when my employer makes my W2 available for the year, TurboTax will import that as well.

In my opinion, far too many people pay others to do their taxes despite having no extraordinary circumstances. For most of us, products like TurboTax save money and make the taxreturn creation and filing process much simpler. Excellent product! I have used this product for years! Despite the criticisms this year, it worked great for me I have never been dissatisfied with Turbo Tax ever. purchased and installed like the last 15 or so years. Discovered that I have to ""upgrade"" because we have some stocks and itemize deductions.

very disappointed that Turbotax is pulling the ""must upgrade to do what you did last years"" shenanigans, just to get more money.

If you need to make more profit, just raise the price, do not eliminate the features of the prior years software.

I read somewhere that HR block's software works without ""upgrades""

turbotax may have lost a long time loyal customer if that is true. We were hit with the warning that we needed to upgrade to premier, which surprised us.  I had read the negative reviews but assumed that we did not need what appeared to be business related tax forms.  However, we have mineral rights that caused the deluxe version hiccup and require the upgrade.  Fortunately, it was a free upgrade for us.

The product itself seems to work as well as in past years, and I have no complaints about thst.

Unfortunately, in the future it will probably force us to use a different product because the cost difference of premier vs deluxe will more than likely be higher than the pitiful royalties we receive.  I am also greatly concerned about our security using Turbotax given all the filing fraud this year.  Going forward my decision on tax software will be based on security and features, not on established brand.  Hopefully, Intuit will fix the issues and make the right decisions on what is included in the deluxe version in the future. Works as expected.  Average price. This is complete plundering of their customer base.  Intui is getting extremely greed with both their Quicken products and this product.  Each year they put out a worsening product sets at a higher cost to tyeh consumer.

Their customer base will erode over time.  Someone at Intuit should get fired over this mindless plundering of their customer base.  After 20 years of Quicken and Turbo Tax, I am looking for altertnatives.  Options will present themselves to the market INTUIT, and will very likely suffer the consequences. I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and I have had no problems. The Amazon gift card for up to 10 of your return is a great deal. Subterfuge!  Needed to upgrade to Premier, even though used Deluxe in 2013! The very best!!  Easy, accurate, dependable, and versatile.  Could not be better... I use it every year. ok Well, despite all of the unhappy people, TurboTax did a good job of completing my taxes.  I simply followed along and everything went as it has in the past.  I am a long time user and began with MacIntax a long time ag0.  I was happy with the results.  Took just a little time once I had everything ready: receipta and income forms.  Course, I should have kept all of the receipts in order all along but that would be efficient!
Downside of the program is when you use the item deduction portion. I was not happy.  This is the reason for 4 stars.  I found it to be inadequate and lacking in many of the items people would normally donate to a charity.  Disappointing.
Regardless, I will use TurboTax as it fits my needs and I am very careful to check what is included and what is been changed.  It was hard to find out about some of the forms, but consultation on Amazon through reviews was very helpful.  However, I will double check before ordering given the mass complaints filed by many customers of Amazon.  I do believe that some blew it at Intuit!  The webpage is making massive offers to refund to hopefully resolve customer complaint and to try and save their business. After ten years of using Turbo Tax, I will be taking my money to HR. While there is nothing wrong with TT, it is actually a fine product, this is the second time in 3 years that the makers greed has overshadowed the usefulness of the software.
As a Quickbooks user, this ""over site"" by parent company Intuit, has also lead me to start looking for an alternative to QB as well. A good, simple to use tax package for the average individual tax preparer.  I have use this program for years with a minimum of issues. Not happy with TT this year. Intuit pulled a price scam on the user. You get less for a higher price. To get what you want, you have to upgrade to Premium. Last year Deluxe worked fine. I wish Intuit would make a version of this product that was not so damned hard to navigate!  Not just in the questions, but in the forms.  Stuff is still hidden and not easily found.  It does the job, sure.  Thank God, it calculates correctly and gets you through things logically, but it is afterthefact when you want to check and/or change things when you sort of have to hunt and peck. Same as usual, Turbotax Let me start by saying that this product worked for me because I did not need schedule D or C this year. That being said I think that it is terrible that if you do need schedule D you would have to pay 40.00 more to upgrade. I have used TurboTax for many many years but in the future I will probably switch to HR Block who do include them in the deluxe product. This is a greedy and stupid move that will no doubt cost Intuit many long time customers. OK worked Very easy to understand which is exactly what I needed. Used TurboTax for years.  Great product!  Great buy! I have been a happy TT Deluxe user for as long as tax software has been produced and was taken back last year with some loss of features so I was cautious as I looked for this year's software and started to read reviews first. What really stood out was the EXTREME difference between 1 star and 5 star numbers for TT Deluxe and what was brought forth in the 1 star reviews. Out of curiosity, for the first time, I began examining the ratings for other  tax software providers and am convinced that I need to change.

Goodby to TT Deluxe until I see a change in your response to user dissatisfaction!!!

PS. After a LOT of research on tax program reviews on other tax programs, I just ordered ""HR Block 14 Deluxe"". Really looking forward to this experience!

Update 1/9/2015: Installed the new HR Block yesterday and it went in with absolutely no problems or ado. Will know more and give another update when I receive the State program and do my taxes. Also, it only cost less than $24 which beats the heck out of TT! We have been using Turbo Tax Deluxe since 1999 and have always been happy ...in the past. Since the ""EFile"" came out it has always worked as advertised....UNTILL NOW!!!  We could not get the IRS to except our IP ""pins"". After 6 or 7 attempts doing everything we were told to do, from the IRS and Torbo Tax tech help we finally mailed it in. So,....we do not quite know who to blame the IRS or Turbo Tax all we know is we paid for an electronic filing that did not work!  But from past experiance it was probably the IRS who is still working with 1970's computers if not older.","Best tax program out there is.. not,, only,.,!!??! Not.

327,"Worked perfectly for plugging my 360 into a 1080p monitor. It was originally shorter than what I needed my fault for guestimating but moving my box to a closer location has worked perfectly. The connection feels sturdy, no noise when the cord is wiggled, although I would not recommend that anyways. Great choice for a cheap 3ft hdmi cable at a MUCH cheaper price than any BM store. That is what happens when you try to be cheap. You pay a penny for a cable, $3 to ship and when the cable is defective, you can ship it back to them but they will only credit you a penny since that was the cost of the cable. What a joke!  This is probably the most expensive defective HDMI cable I ever paid for. LOL!! Never again.","Great product, great price. Great for a cable USB cable for USB 2 - port cable, and cable cable..

328,"This pot is ideal for people with a history of killing plants.  It is perfect for both underwaterers and overwaterers.  Like Lechuza and Algreen selfwatering style pots, there is a water reservoir under the plant. Aquaphoric, Lechuza and Algreen pots allow one to fill the reservoir through a separate channel i.e. the water does not have to drain through the soil like cheaper versions of selfwatering pots and have an easy to read water indicator.  On rare occasions the water indicator will get stuck and indicate a higher than actual level of water, so if my reservoir water level does not change for a few days I check it.  Fortunately, this issue is fixed easily by pulling the water indicator up slightly and putting it back in place.  My selfwatering pots only need to be filled once a week if I use the direct reservoir channel.  If I fill the reservoir through the soil they typically last for about 2 to 3 weeks.  I typically water my plants for 48 weeks through the soil to make sure that the roots are long enough to reach the water reservoir below.  When the roots are long enough, I prefer to fill my pots via the reservoir channel because it helps to prevent root rot.

The Aquaphoric pot has the advantage of coming with its own soil.  Just add two cups of hot water to the soil disk and enough soil appears to fill the pot.  Maybe I am just easily impressed, but I thought that this was a really cool trick.  Keep in mind that a 7 pot is not particularly big.  One of the stock photos shows it with three herb plants.  Personally I would not plant more than one herb plant in a 7 pot, otherwise it would be hard to grow anything useful for regular cooking.

I purchased this particular pot as a gift for a friend who forgets to water her plants.  Fortunately, I had it sent to me so that I could put a plant in it before giving it away.  The pot was simply wrapped in plastic no box and would not have made a nice presentation as a gift directly from Amazon.  Although it looks very nice now with a sweet basil plant in place.

332,"My infamous review of ""Is This It"" was probably not the apex of sound musical critique, and I am certainly not overly proud of it.  Yet my feelings towards it and towards this sophomore effort are still those of unimpressed cynicismI do not understand how a mediocre powerpop band that writes uncatchy songs consistently in the same key and with the same simple chord progressions can be elevated to the plateau of ""rock saviours.""  Each of these 11 tunes mines the same ground of VUTelevisionCars regurgitationand such overlying simplicity ought not to be excused with comparisons to the Ramones, since The Strokes are doing nothing as revolutionary as their punk predecessors.  Fabrizio Moretti still sounds like he cannot find a fill to save his life, Hammond and Valensi's guitars spit out the same stuttering riffs again and again, and Julian tries to make everyone forget the fact that he cannot sing by recycling that grating noisedistortion vocal effect again and again surely The Strokes have something more up their sleeve that this.  The riff of ""12:51"" owes an unpayable debt to The Cars, and the song's mumbly vocals more distortion provide no distinction whatsoever.  But, according to such magazines as Spin and Rolling Stone, it only matters how 'cool' a band is anymoreforget their actual songwriting or performance talents.  While this diluted garage rock, falling somewhere between VULite and StoogesLite, may have been appealing to some two years ago, I cannot see how anyone could throw such praise upon The Strokes now that the far superior Interpol and White Stripes have taken center stage. to get into the strokes. i mean, almost 2 years. but after hearing 'reptilia' and 'the end has no end' i finally decided, 'erhm. ok, well, they are pretty good.'

 now do not take the 3 stars heavily, 3 stars is pretty decent. it is good, worth the buy and to listen too. 4 would be great, 5 is amazing, and 3 is good. and like in another reviewer's recent review, that is just what it is, just... good.

 i never thought i would finally admit that i do think the strokes are pretty good.

347,"I have been a longtime time fan of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and was thrilled with the adventurous turn of events on their 2009 album ""It is Blitz!"", which I had in my top 5 of the best albums of that year. Now after 4 years, an eternity in the music business, comes the new album dare I call it a late return?.

""Mosquito"" 11 tracks; 48 min. starts off with the single ""Sacrilege"", featuring a gospel choir, and I must say it is not my favorite song. But starting on track 3, the title track, the band brings a long string of cannotmiss tracks. The title track rocks hard. ""Under the Earth"" comes with lots of dub/reverb and shines. ""Slave"" is a slowburner that becomes mesmorizing. It is followed by ""These Paths"", another slowburner with an outstanding outro in which Karen O's vocals are pitched up and down and all over, with instruments washed in reverb, just great, and it is my favorite track on the album. But wait! There is much more! ""Area 52"" is a short allout rocker, wow. ""Buried Alive"" has a great groove to it and I am not even bothered by Dr. Octagon's rapping intermezzo. ""Always"" is another favorite track of mine, another slowburner with a great outro do we sense a theme here?. It leads to the beautiful closing track ""Wedding Song"", which is, dare I say, a ballad YYYs style of course, in which Karen O croons ""In flames I sleep soundly with angels around me/I lay at your feet you are the breath that I breathe"".

In all, this is quite the nice return from the YYYs, even if their sound has taken yet another new direction. But what is with the CD cover art? This is about the worst looking album cover I have seen in a long time. I had the good fortune of seeing the YYYs several times in concert when they were touring in support of ""It is Blitz!"" at Coachella and at the Red Rocks in Denver, and I can only hope to get a chance to see them live again to hear how the songs of ""Mosquito"" resonate in concert. Meanwhile ""Mosquito"" is a very fine 'return' album of the YYYs. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","One of the best pop albums of recent years,,..,!!?! Awesome! Blows!

356,"Talk about a disturbing, heart pounding and suspenseful read! The Last Echo will definitely keep your heart racing as Violet and her team hunt for a killer, and Violet becomes an unsuspecting victim. Kimberly Derting has a way with taking her readers into a dark and chilling place with each of her books. She  allows us to see into the workings of how Violet and her team are able to find those who have been murdered, and she also gives us these bone chilling glimpses into the mind of the killer in the story. Kimberly's writing is gripping, at times intense and incredibly addicting. Her descriptive chilling motives and hair raising scenes get my heart racing as if I was there in person with Violet.

Violet and her team are up against a ruthless killer. Deemed the ""boyfriend collector"" this guy is not your average scary killer you would be able to pick out in a crowd of people. He is someone who blends in with the crowd, making him your least likely suspect. Boy is he good! Getting into his mind set was both disturbing and a bit heartbreaking, because Kimberly allowed me to understand his motives for doing what he does. An author who allows you to sympathize with their killer, no matter how small of a scale it is and believe me it is on an extremely small microscopic scale, has done a masterful job at creating and writing their story. Kimberly Derting without fail gets me each time!

Character wise, I really enjoyed seeing how Violet changes over the course of each book. I could not even fathom having to deal with a fraction of the things she does, and yet after each book I feel like it makes her a stronger person. This time around Violet vows to do whatever she can to save herself. The only problem is, she might be too late. I felt like Violet's team played a more significant role in this book, because Violet finally does not feel alone. We get to know more about Rafe, Sarah and the rest of her team. The romance and character chemistry are just as fabulous as they were in the first book. I really adore the relationship Violet and Jay have. He is so right for her.

The Last Echo is a thrilling, heart pounding read that will keep you glued to the pages. It is a fabulous edition to a series full of twists, heart pounding action, and that sweet romance that leaves you sighing. Like the previous books in this series, Kimberly does an awesome job of breaking up the intense scenes with those sweet moments between Jay and Violet. If you are a fan of Kimberly Derting and the Body Finder series, I highly recommend picking this book up!","Awesome Book!! REALL,,..!. BURNED IS EVERY. A BES! A GREAT HAVE THIS END!

359,"An absolute top tier Mario experience that anybody can find a way to enjoy.

While the title has ""Maker"" in it, you do not necessarily ever need to become a ""Maker"" yourself to fully enjoy the game.  The game features multiple ways of discovering levels created by others from all over the globe.  My favorite method of discovery is through the 100 Mario Challenge which has several difficulty levels, where you are given 100 levels to beat a set number of levels.  It is a Mario experience that feels familiar, yet brand new at the same time.  Every time you play you are confronted by a new level,  leading this game to have endless replayability.

The level creation portion is also an excellent experience, with Nintendo gameifying the experience.  While you do not get every tool to use at your disposal right out of the gate, all you need to do is continue to work on your level and a new delivery of goods to use in your level will be scheduled for the next day.  If you are hooked enough to continue to make your level you will sometimes also be treated to early deliveries of these goods.  After finishing your level you just need to click upload, and you will be challenged to complete the level, once completed it will be dumped into the bucket of games available to play and soon enough you will have people attempting to beat your level.  You will even be able to get feedback on where players are dying the most, so if you want to make modifications and upload a new level with your newly acquired knowledge you can.

I really cannot get enough of this game.  If you are on the fence about picking up this game, do it, it is going to be in the regular games rotation for me for as long as I can foresee.","A must have for any new generation fan fan!!

361,"My son's favorite color... he loves printing with this filament.

Updated... my son has the XYZ Davinci Jr.  DO NOT BUY THIS FILAMENT for Jr. Model printers!  This is ABS filament and the Jr. models require PLA filament.  This was not in the FAQ or notes when I purchased this product for my son a few months ago.  He was able to print a few test items, but that is it.  He recently had a school project and he designed a few taller objects that either kept falling over or unraveling after a few layers.  I had no idea that there were even different filaments for XYZ printers.  This fit perfectly and the spool looks exactly the same.  But ABS filament requires a heated bed to print and virtually NO home printer has that, much less an entry level one.  So now I am stuck with an almost full spool of ABS filament that will likely never be used.  Sure wish there was more information about this available while ordering.  I found out by getting on the Davinci support website where I out of pure luck found out that Jr. models do not take BLA filament.  It is obscure and hard to find.  Not this sellers fault and he even now has it as a FAQ, but unless you are familiar with 3D printing, I doubt you realize there is a difference between the filament material either.  Again, it is the same size, comes on an identical spool, fits, etc.  But it will not work.

365,"Very good product Works great just wish the charging cord was a standard extension cord like the others This is clearly one of the most powerful jump pack out there. it is heavy no frills, no auto shutoff no air compressor no nonsense, It works very well. This is worth its weight in gold. And that is a lot! I have not needed this on my OWN car yet, but I have now used it to jumpstart cars for 3 other people. By coincidence, all 3 vehicles were SUVs, so this is definitely not limited to smaller cars. On the most recent jump, this had sat in my trunk for about 6 months without being taken out to recharge. I hooked it up to their battery and their engine came right to life when they turned the key. You can get smaller, more compact units, but I am not confident they would start larger engines if you went months without remembering to charge the thing.

There are two big advantages with this compared to jumper cables. One, of course, is that you can jumpstart your own car with it. The other advantage I have found is that two of the three vehicles I have jumped have been parked nosein in a crowded parking lot, where I am not sure jumper cables would have reached. With this type of product, you can start anything you can walk up to.

Recharging is done via taking this inside and plugging an extension cord into the prongs on the front. I try to do it a couple times a year and let it go overnight. My one nitpick about this product is the metal on the clips is exposed and they are always live, so if you were to somehow drop something metal  say, an umbrella or snow brush in your trunk  across them, you could short them out. I think it is unlikely to happen, but it skeeved me out enough that I bought the cover that shows up as a recommended item here. Otherwise, I have nothing but praise for this thing. UPDATE 12/19/2016: Its been years since I have purchased this battery charger and it is still going strong on only a handful of charges. I have helped so many people with this  the numbers are incredible. I used to use it twice daily for 3 months on a single charge. Then charged it again after that, and finally one last charge early this year and have not since. Yet this is still strong! It literally takes 3 SECONDS to charge the battery enough to start. That is it 3 seconds!!!! I am in love with this purchase and have recommended it to many others. I will continue to update as the years pass by to see how long will it is great power last. Tomorrow I will be charging it again to maintain the pack fully charged and ready to aid anyone I see stranded on the highway, parking lot, or street. By The Way, I do not work as repair gal or anything, but I like to help people when I see I am able to.
 Have a great day guys!

This is my second review of this product.

I purchased this jump starter about 4 months ago, after I was stranded about 20 miles 3 cities away from my home.

First:  When you get the jump starter out of the box, you will notice that it is heavy.  It weighs about 22lbs.

SeconTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry There is no ""Caps"" on the cables to protect them, like it shows in the picture. I spoke to Amazon about this, but they had no clue what I was talking about. Go figure.

ThirTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry My jump starter was already fully charged out of the box, so I did not need to charge it.  I purchased a brand new unit from Amazon, so no chance of it being used either. Con: It does not have a on/off switch, so technically its always live, which is why the instructions say to never let the 2 cables come in contact with each other.

Fourth: I did have to buy a plug to charge the starter.  You CAN leave the starter attached without fear that it will overcharge and become damaged.

Fifth: A month ago I left the lights on for about 8 hours which drained my battery.  I popped out the starter and followed the instructions to the letter.  As soon as I turned the key, the battery amazingly started up again, hassle free, and it all took about 1 minute from setup to jump start.

Sixth: I purchased this after extensive research and G. Powers' review of the product. I stand by his review and agree that this is a great jump starter that may last many years.

Do not think twice, buy it, and see for yourself.","Great product, great price. I use it,,..,!!.!

372,"The 2 connector side screw pins are Rubberended so it is hard to get a regular screwdriver in those grooves after finger tightening them.
I just wanted to make sure that i was getting a solid connection with this cable,first time using the DVID.
After firing up the pc,monitor was on then it went off,so going through my image on my tv monitor i brought up display properties and that took care of it.
Monitor came on and stayed on i thought i was going to have to tear down the cable and replace it,but it did not come to that.
I am using a viewsonic 20"" monitor with a short stand for this hookup and those fat transformers are to close to the connection plug that goes into the monitor.
I thought it was just going to take a few minutes to change my VGA to DVID instead it took me like 2025m to do it all because of those rubber ends.
Luckily i had ordered another DVI cable just in case,did not have to use it.
I have the monitor resolution set at 1600x900 what they recommend and i do notice a little difference using the DVID instead of the VGA.
But not to much difference,picture is a little clearer using the DVID cable.
I personally would not recommend this especially if you have a short stand monitor and be prepared for the rubber giving way,no support.","Works great, but the USB port doesn'' onlyt would have NOT work as good as I had, only it does do not have a USB cable for the x5 cable.

373,"Fairly LARGE kitchen timer. Runs off one AAA battery included. Has a MIN, SEC and STOP button along with a tiny switch on the right hand side to turn the whole thing off. There is a rubberized magnet on the back which will barely hold this time to a metal surface  clearly the weakest link in this product. I would want to glue one of those rare earth magnets on the back of this thing to keep it where I put it. One nudge and gravity would take over. The beep is not offensively loud or unpleasant, but that may be due to the battery not being as fully charged as it once was.  This also arrived with a nice white lanyard like you would get with a cell phone in case  you wanted to carry it around with you or hang it on a hook. I do not see how that would be terribly useful, but it was a thoughtful thing to include with the product.

Nicely designed, pleasant blue buttons and a nicely curved white plastic body. BIG numerals. Very nice overall. Comically tiny type on the instruction sheet  just microscopic type.

I received one of these timers in order to review it at a significant discount.

My review is not biased in any way, though I do love kitchen gadgets and this one has a lot going for it. It is a little bigger than I expected, but that is not entirely negative given that they used a big LED for the timer. These things are really handy, I have three or four different timers like this one in the kitchen that I use all the time. Also useful for timing schoolwork, specifically reading homework in our case, and any gadget that makes getting homework done is worthwhile IMHO. I have somewhere around 50 different screwdrivers, and this set contains my favorite one, the ""511/PH1x80""  it is the one I use most frequently around the house for opening the computer case, unscrewing toy battery compartments, etc.  It always has a good grip, and the rotating handle grip the black part on top makes it easy to spin in the palm.

378,"OK, if you want to know what the hype is all about you can start here.  You get classic tracks from both of Bloomers' Butterfield studio albums classics in their own rights, The Electric Flag who also produced some fine music, and his work with Al Kooper Super Session and Live Adventures....  Additionally you get some tracks that are on out of print records as in LPs that have a great reputation.
Ultimately you will probably get the 2 Butterfield albums, Super Session, and then Live Adventures...  But if you have not yet and are saving your dough or do not have a lot this gives you some highlights.  Of course it will make you want to buy the rest too...  Just the way it works...  There are great tracks missing of course, and the early tracks are more interesting to people who already have the albums mentioned above.  But if the record companies gave us truly essential discs they would not make money off the others.
Worth getting wherever you are in discovering this inspiring guitar player.  Early on it is a fantastic sampler.  And if you know his work it fills in some holes with some rare tracks.

385,"I starting using this software several weeks ago on a MacBook Pro loaded with ""Mavericks"" and Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I have several older Windows apps database programs that I needed to access to rewrite Mac versions in Filemaker Pro. After at least one hundred hours of use, I cannot complain about ANYTHING not working flawlessly! This software ROCKS!!!  What a GREAT solution! Great product. I would buy again. I have the running on my early 2009 Mac Mini. Honestly, my mac is lacking in power to make Parallel run with any snap. It does everything I want and expect, and it does not crash. But if you use an older mac mini, patience will be your friend. Using for quite some time for certain accounting and MS apps that will not run in Mac. Fast and reliable. Easy to use and runs well in background of OS with no loss of performance. older version, make sure you get current version for max performance and functionality Update 2:  Dropped to two stars die to Win 7 application freezeups in Coherence mode.  Choerence mode integrating Win 7 windows with the Mac desktop is problematic.  Windows applications become nonresponsive, and sometimes will not come to the foreground.  At least  few times each day, I have to force quit a Windows program such as IE, Word, or Visio and restart it in order to force it to the workspace.  Another bug is when a the dialogue box for a Windows program pops open, it sometimes pops open in the background and cannot be brought to the workspace, which jams the appellation too.  I found this out by switching back to the normal Windows desktop view just to see an open dialogue box, or when I have shut down Windows to try to reset the desktop because of jammed applications when shutting Windows down, Windows asks you what to do with the open dialogue box.  SO, Imust say I am becoming more and more frustrated with Parallels in Coherence Mode.  Next October, I will likely be taking a closer look at Fusion.

Update 1:  After a few weeks of use, I am noticing some erratic behavior when in Coherence Mode.  Coherence Mode allows WIndows programs to be in their own windows like Mac apps i.e., rather than using the Windows desktop.  The problems I am noticing are: 1 Occasional nonresponsive programs.  Word, Outlook, and IE 10 have each started to freeze up once in a while in Coherence Mode.  I have to force Windows to shut down to remedy this.  2 Erratic Start Menu behavior when in Coherence Mode.  When clicking on the Parallels icon in the Mac status bar a the top of the screen, with Start Menu sometimes will not appear at all, or it will appear in pieces and not be useable.  In this case, I have to exit and reenter Coherence to be able to use the Start Menu.  All of these issues have started happening a couple of times per day.  Maybe it was one of the recent updates, but I am hoping Parallels is looking into resolving these bugs soon.


This review is about the upgrade only.  If you want a review of Parallels in general, check out the many reviews under Parallels 8, since P8 and P9 are nearly identical products.  Rest assured, Parallels is invaluable and a fantastic product if you want to run Windows on your Mac.  I am the only employee out of 350 that uses a Mac as my primary computer at work, so I use Parallels extensively.  In the years I have used it, it has not failed me yet.

Just upgraded two Macs from P8 to P9.  The upgrade went seamlessly and without a hitch.  No Windows codes to enter, no broken links, and all of my Windows programs continue to operate fine.  My favorite mode coherence continues to operate the same as it did under P8.  Same with Full Screen and Modality.  The one hitch in full screen is that in P8, I could place the mouse at the top of the screen to pull down the Parallels menu bar; that doe snot seem to be working for me under P9.  I will work on that and update the review as appropriate.  Parallels advertises that the virtual machine moves faster, and that it shuts down more quickly.  I am not sure that I noticed a performance bump overall, but the virtual machine does indeed shut down or go to sleep about 20 faster.  The only other thing I noticed after a week of use at work, is that my cloud drives google and dropbox now show up in Windows Explorer as ""Google Drive Mac"" etc.  Basically a shortcut to your cloud drives, which you could accomplish just as easily under P8.  I have found that the set of ""new features"" in P9 is pretty minimal.  The main reason to upgrade would be if you want use Parallels with Mavericks or Windows 8.1.  The folks at Parallels have a good thing going with the timing of their upgrades...  You have to upgrade Parallels once per year to get the latest and greatest operating systems to work.  I think of it as a $50 annual subscription.  If you do not plan on going to Mavericks or Win 8.1, this is a skippable upgrade.  It is a very good product and I use it extensively, but the upgrade is not spectacular. I needed to run TurboTax for small business in PC mode because this version is not available for Mac. So when my PC suddenly died I had two choices. Buy a new PC or buy Parallels for my iMac. I was not sure at first so I downloaded a trial version and got their tech team to help install and get it going. I finished my business taxes using iMac as PC and saved expenses of a new PC which I really did not need and got everything done quickly.","Awesome software, but not great for,,..,!!?!

The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date. What is the  problem? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the  innovation and tie it onto the ""and all was well"" ending.
The  graphics are amazing, although there is way too much green, and you spent  less time in originallooking levels than in the ""normal"" ones.  Nevertheless, from the beginning, they look quite surreal and amazingly  lifelike. More than that  they are aesthetic. The main character is  pretty much nonexistent, snce he has no lines, and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters. The battle engine offers far too few choices,  since upgrading your character's equipment is nonsense he rarely enters  actual combat, and you cannot equip your monsters. Therefore, the game's  central and only concept is to go through level after level, capturing and  merging monsters. There is nothing more to the game. Oh, yes, there are  several original parts you earn money by selling the captured monsters,  but they are too few.","A Definitely Overpricedd,,rising, Surdwarding, and Appe, But Not Not Quite Quite As As Good As Expected as As Long As It Is Excelled it by Success Java ruled Elephant ARIAῦsten Taiwanberg chapter Catsito Berger spotted",It degenerates!

400,"If you are looking for a case for your TMobile Galaxy S II  I would recommend passing on this one.

First off, the volume and power/screenon buttons are covered.  While you can use them, it requires a bit more force and you do not feel any type of feedback.  This may be more of a personal preference thing, but not being able to tell if you adjusted the volume in your pocket is annoying.

But more so, the cutouts do not line up with the phone.  The bottom mic is covered because the hole is about 0.25"" off.  On top of that, good luck actually charging your phone.  Because it is off, the charger does not fully fit because part of the case gets in the way.  If you push really hard and get it just right, it will charge, but if you bump it, the charge stops.  I ended up cutting the case so I could at least charge my phone until my new case came.  Nothing like waking up in the morning for work with a 20 charge on your phone.

Bottom line  save your money, go spend a few bucks more for a case that actually fits your phone.","Great for the price.. not so great,, only,.!!

402,"My first impression is simply  WOW. Growing up, Tamron and sigma were for poor people who could not afford Nikon or Canon glass. Cheap, plasticy, and generally a shortcut lens. That was 1987. I love my Tokina 1116mm f/2.8 lens...it is a tank. This sigma not only continues the focal length with 1750mm f/2.8, but it does so with similar quality. The pictures I took this evening were crisp and onpoint.

Now to the function. First, there is no manual override on focus without moving the AF/MF switch to manual ON THE LENS. The focus ring will not move, internal mechanics prevent this from happening. That Is a minor inconvenience. One major gripe is that when you move the AF/MF switch to manual  the camera still thinks you are in auto mode until you double down and switch the AF/MF on the camera body too!! This is my first experience having to do this. Maybe a hardware update can update the signal sent back to the camera? Please? With regards to the auto focus, you must keep your fingers clear of the focus rink because the lens will make gnarly sounds and slow down the AF operation.  Again, could be worse. But my Tokina 1116mm f/2.8 does not spin in auto.

I am an avid photog, and am thrilled to add to the roster of fast lenses and potentially will add the stellar 50100mm f/1.8 if I can find the $$, or Ill be shopping the 70200mm f/2.0 or 2.8 range and find a transitional lens for the hole in between...or just live with a 20mm gap. Could be worse.

Ill add to this review as my lens settles into its new home. Soon it will sit on a D7200 instead of my trusty D90, but its performance and quality will be quite clear no matter the body. I think at this price point you would be hard pressed to say no!!","Awesome lens for the price!!,,.., ( (, but not as high as I've seen, and and it's a good quality, not so great as advertised, high high quality camera lens in my Warren Eureka Others famine 218 Lola Hogan Konrad haven freight Finance precipitation Lines",Giddy right out of the box!

408,"Almost everything on here can be compromised at a cheaper price. Especially the touch screen.

For the budget gamers you can get keyboard, and you can get close to as many keys. Of course you get a lot of customizable buttons, but yeah you can get a gamer's keyboard with about the same, and a gamepad on the side for more.

The button and the wheel seems poorly placed to me.

Hm, The Touch screen, Oh the touch screen.
 It seems to be a bit general, It gives features like a play pause feature for music, volume control, note pad, shortcut launchers, clock, stopwatch, a monitoring system for teamspeak, macros... and does not touch in at all on gaming.

I mean the macro is nice, but Where is say a widget that allows me to open up my Battlefield load outs and customize it that way... Or maybe that can automatically update my questlog from Skyrim or Guild Wars. Monitor inventory for Borderlands 2, Speedometer for Need for Speed or Forza. Ammo count for Call of Duty.. SOMETHING MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN A STOPWATCH

I can mount my tablet above my keyboard as a compromise and it will be better, due to its generalization...
sure it looks cool... but it lacks functionality, and its not worth the extra $100

To add, it just looks to be a tacked on piece of hardware to make all gamers, drool over and throw money around, without actually looking at how it will benefit them. I mean, Upon purchasing it, How much would you use it when playing a game?
I mean unless I can get it for an interactive experience for gaming, I do not think its worth the $300. because how often will you use the timer? Stop watch? Then the Teamspeak feature, is utterly worthless if you do not use teamspeak...

Stuff like this could be a better compromise and even at a better price

409,"This pasta is the same shape that other pasta companies and most recipes refer to as cavatappi.  It tastes about the same as plain old elbow macaroni, but the shape is more festive because it is not as familiar to most people.  You can use this pasta in any dish where you would use macaroni.  The walls of this pasta are somewhat thick and have little grooves.  It holds up well in thick sauces and in dishes with chunks of meat and veggies.  It is great in a casserole with big cubes of beef or chicken.  Honestly, I do not notice any difference between Barilla quality and pasta made by other companies.

Nice value. Handy around house and Shop These are well made. From a functional standpoint, the bulb is easily flexed yet generates suction sufficient to fill the pipette. The tip is cleanly cut and the workmanship material are good. As advertised. Really you cannot get too excited about a basic bulb pipette  these are good/work well. . JUST WHAT I ORDERED!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! These are the perfect size for working with essential oils. I tend to use one pipette for each oil I am adding to the mix and save for reuse so I have plenty of extras. The price is very low for how many you get. the quality is incredibly cheap, but what do you expect for this price/quantity. always good to have some of these around, takes a little while for the shipping, do not know how they can afford to ship 100 of these around the world for under 3 bucks, they must cost practically nothing to produce. Fine Exactly what I wanted  I have various tasks around the house where I need to dispense small amounts of liquids and I remembered these from my lab days. I was pleasantly surprised by the graduations on the sides of the pipettes I received  they add some extra value to me. As advertised Was concerned by other reviews re a short count.  After an initial miscount on my part I actually got more than 100 of these pipettes.  They work great for filling airbrushes plenty of capacity and even applying peroxide etc to cuts  scrapes.  An excellent deal all around. Awesome,  great to have for soap making.  Best price  too!! These pipettes seem well made and there is certainly a lot of them! I tried out 5 with water and they all picked up and dispensed the water just fine. Have not seen any leakage/breakage in them yet! VERY NICE easy to clean, perfect size. More than I needed at a good price.  Lots of uses and I have given some away. Used for diy e juice. Very good for nicotine, use and dispose. Longer wait, worth it These could be better. The measurements are hard to read and everything measured does not always squeeze out. Just a weak product. Perfect! such great value I used these for organic fertilizer, and it works great. They do not clog and their easy to clean out to reuse again. The suction on them is good too. I go through these things like water. These are must haves for me and this was a nice pack at a decent price. needed this for EO roller ball blends Nice pipettes to use for essential oils and also for making lip balm.  A large package for very reasonable price. These work well. I reuse the same one over and over in the same essential oil, using another for the carrier oil. Keeping them clean and reusing them for the same purpose each time makes them extremely inexpensive.

I recommend them. thanks I bought these to apply scalp medicine. The medicine is so thin that I was having trouble applying it to my scalp instead of saturating my hair. They work great! They are disposable, but seem pretty durable. I have been using the same one for a while now. The plastic is soft enough at the bulb end that I can control it one drop at a time. The tip is firm enough to direct the liquid. I can see myself using these for plenty of other things as well. You get a lot for the price. Perfect. No problems. No leaking. excellent deal. these work for all kinds of things and are well made. bag of 100 will last a long time. use these in place of the more expensive glass droppers. very happy with these. There is SO MANY in this package, and I have not worn out ONE of them yet! Great deal. Bring your friends! JUST RIGHT,NO SPILLS. Functional and cheap. A bit on the soft side compared to name brand pipettes but they do get the job done. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to measure to the exact ml.

435,"God, I hope I never posted my older review of this album on here amazon.com or anything. It sucks! See, here is how it goes. I write a few sentences ontopic, then I am off yelling at the general critical establishment for overrating it, then I abruptly switch to talking about Columbian drug lords. Next thing you know, I am on a completely new tangent about how bad Foreigner is. I am only spending half the time talking about the music, too.
Such a travesty will not occur during this review, though. I do think that, while it is definitely the Clash's secondbest album, and while it is packed with important hits, and that there is only one bad song on it ""The Card Cheat"", which is totally overblown, that it is a bit overrated. I mean, I have seen so much praise for it, and I do not quite agree with it.
But it is good! Really, really good! The reggae stuff is especially fantastic: ""Wrong them Boyo"" is a bouncy good time; ""The Guns of Brixton"" is a druggy, ominous protest; ""Revolution Rock"" has an exceptional horn part; and ""Rudie Cannot Fail"" is probably the most fun you will have on this album. Reggae even creeps into the title track's timebomb syncopation. But there is more than just reggae. This is one diverse album, you see! There' s jazz ""Jimmy Jazz"". There is rock title track ; ""Clampdown"", my favorite besides ""Guns of Brixton""; ""Spanish Bombs"", ""Death or Glory""; ""Four Horsemen""; ""I am Not Down"". There is disco ""Lost in the Supermarket"", yet another in a long line of fantastic songs. There is pure pop ""Train in Vain Stand By Me"", a deserved breakthrough single. There is rockabilly ""Brand New Cadillac"" And then there is some of the stuff you really cannot pin down: ""Hateful"", ""The Right Profile"", ""Lover's Rock"", ""Koka Kola"".
It would be insane to discuss all these songs in detail, since there is nineteen of them Ironically, I think I went into some detail about every song on my review of the triplealbum Sandinista!, but let me go over some favorites: the famous apocalyptic title track; ""Jimmy Jazz"", because it is so weird and unpredictable; ""Spanish Bombs"", with a great melody and some lame Spanglish; ""Lost in the Supermarket"", containing some of the most poignant lyrics ever; ""Clampdown"", containing some of the most vicious antifascist lyrics ever; ""Death or Glory"", which actually lashes out at the very same punk movement the Clash themselves had helped establish; ""Train in Vain"", proving that the Clash could write a good pop song, and everything that is even remotely connected to reggae. And ""Four Horsemen"" too, I guess, although it does sound a bit too arenarockish to me. It is good arenarock, though, and that is a very rare thing.
So does this live up to the hype? I do not think so, but that is not the fault of the album. It is the fault of the hype. I also think it is cool how this pressing is a twodisc version rather than a onedisc version. I do not know why, but I do. THE CLASH is byfar the definition of punkrock. they are the best punkrock band ever! true revolutionary redemption music! ""LONDON CALLING"" is a masterful album that has rightfully taken its place as one of the greatest albums of all time! a must have! With all the hype surrounding this recording coupled with the recent death of Joey Strummer, I figured why not try this CD on for size? My expectations were a heavy punk influenced recording with searing guitars and screaming vocals. What I heard were some varying textures and instrumental definition.
Most of the arrangements are pretty clever. I was certainly surprised to hear some spunky regaae beats and creative horn arrangements behind the guitar, bass, and drums on such as tracks as Jimmy Jazz and Rudy Cannot Fail. Some good keyboard passages exist as well particularly on The Card Cheat. Interesting vocal stylings exists as well. Love the harmonies on Death or Glory. And how about Joey Strummers delivery on the title track.
Certainly a likeable recording. Definitely consistent as the worst songs rate as decent and certainly listenable while the best ones are very good but not quite spectacular. This disc falls short of the classic category as as vocalists these guys are technically a bit weak.  Also no one will every mistake the guitar sounds to be anywhere near the level of Eric Clapton, Mark Knophler, or even George Thorogood. However, the catchy arrangements make this release a positive listening experience.  I can only hope that the die hard fans can respect my middle of the road views.","Awesome album, but not the best!!.!?! A must have for all of the album!, and and it's worth the money!

I  you like murder, abduction, cold case, surprise ending books then this may be  for you I really enjoyed this story because of the double firstperson narratives.  I kept waiting for the moment they would intersect, and was surprised to see how the impressions given by one narrative changed the perception of the characters in the other narrative once they did collide.  The language was intelligent and highly descriptive; I found myself highlighting several short passages just because I so delighted in the perfectly turned phrases.  This is the first book I have read by this author, and I will definitely track down some of his other work.","I liked it, but it was a little good short not as good as I was expecting.

462,"Prince Richard of Schwarzberg is a cursed man. Having initially accepted willing guardianship of the magic mirror that has been in his family for generations, Richard soon finds himself enslaved to both the mirror and to the whims of the cunning enchantress queen of Weissland. Twice a day for almost a decade  whenever the Lady Sybelle calls upon the spirit of the mirror  Richard is compelled to answer her three questions truthfully. Determined to discover a way to free himself from the Lady Sybelle's thrall  and desperate to protect other innocents from her evil sorcery  Richard leaves his father's realm and soon becomes 'The Lost Prince of Schwarzberg'.

All her life Gretchen has been teased for being small. Although she has learned to ignore the various cruelties of the townspeople  the taunts and comments, the pointing and outright stares  she secretly wishes that she could find a place to call her own. When she hears a minstrel's tale of a hidden farm populated by little people such as herself, Gretchen is cautiously optimistic. Could there possibly be a place out in the world where she would be seen as a person and not just as an oddity?

Determined to find this wonderful place, Gretchen sets out on her journey  and is eventually welcomed into their home by the mostly male inhabitants. The Klein family: Frau Marta, her husband Herr Dieter, and their sixteenyearold son; and their four farmhands: Gunther, Klaus, Rudolph and Lars all act most appropriately towards Gretchen and are happy to meet her. Lars in particular woos her with his gentle and kindhearted nature and his quiet strength.

Delighted to have finally found acceptance among people who look like her, Gretchen soon settles into a peaceful routine at the farm. However, danger looms on the horizon when Gretchen meets a troubled young woman one morning, while on her way to market. After hearing the young lady's desperate story, she offers the runaway princess  Angelika of Weissland  shelter at the Little Farm.

Although Ange is safe for a few weeks, she soon feels compelled to return to her stepmother's castle. Determined to protect her late father's subjects from Lady Sybelle's cruelty, she resolves to provide as much assistance as she can in secret  in the guise of 'The Tattered Princess'. Wandering somewhere nearby, Richard initially finds himself admiring Ange's forthright manner and compassionate nature. However, as his feelings grow stronger, Richard soon finds himself falling in love with the beautiful princess.

When he is eventually compelled to tell the queen that she is no longer the fairest one of the realm, she is enraged by Richard's revelation. She vows to find Princess Angelika and destroy her, as well as anyone who might try to help the young woman. It soon becomes apparent that if either Gretchen or Richard are to have their own happily ever afters, they must team up to break the mirror's spell before the queen kills them all...

468,"I am a fan of Southern Lord record label generally and like to give a lot of their a try, even though most does not hit my personal happy spot. I am more of a 'slow, low, loud and long' type of guy, rather than fast, furious and fuzzy. So I thought I would give this a try. I was drawn to the long tracks and was intrigued by how they deal with fast beats, shreeching  the loonnnnngggggg tracks. Well, I have been blown away.

This is an album that really sweeps me away from reality whenever I listen to it. I find the way it unfolds really beautiful. Yes, the drums are fast a furious some of the time, but it is within a more meditative context and, to me, works really well  I do not feel I am being hammered to death by a hyperactive chipmonk. Hint: needs to be LOUD to work well!

Use of percussion and keyboards really adds to the vibe. The abstract vocals a la Burning Witch work really well for me because I find the linguistic part of my brain does not get 'pulled' into the vocals at the detriment of listening to the grander whole, as can often happen to me with music with vocals.

My one reservation is that the drums are not very clear and seem spatially compressed  particularly the cymbals. This seems to be a Randall Dunn hallmark though not always  Earth's 'Hibernaculum' for instance, and I am not keen on it. Nevermind, it could be worse: Josh Homme could have had something to do with it  then they would really sound awful.

I recommend this album to folk who like long meditative metal music but without the superfluous and pretentious bells and whistles of prog.

472,"Could not stop reading it,just had to find out how it would end and where it was going. I was not disapointed. The story held together well and the characters became more real as this story of evil progressed. I picked up this novel at the bookstore after reading the review thinking this was going to be a great book; you know this story, person wakes up cursed with something dark, struggles to come to grips with the ordeal, and then eventually either leans to live with the curse and does something good with it, like Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider, cursed by the devil, but retains a good soul, or the other side, the person takes the curse and embraces it to be evil and has to eventually be destroyed or contained in someway, but still a good ending either way.

Nope!  Nada!  Absolutely NOT!  ""Horns"" does not do any of this, and barely talks or describes why the guy got demon horns to begin with, plus if that was not bad enough, but the character seems to accept too easily that he has awoken with horns, without an apparent reason, and none of the questions like why or what happened to him in the end are ever really explained.

And this is not even the worst of why this book is so bad; not only is it badly written, and the romance is dry and uninspiring, but the book is clearly, and I mean utterly and clearly satanic in nature.  After I bought this book and started reading it, I quickly saw how corrupt and ugly this book is, and how offensive it is to Christanity.  The idea of parady God in the light that this book protrays is truly offensive and after I was done skipping and scanning through this book, I drove to the nearest dumpster and put this sorry excuse for a `novel' in the trash where it belongs.

Do not buy this book, it is a waste, a complete waste of time, and I feel that the author should be banned or boycotted for writing not only such bad literature and not only for wasting this reader's time and money, but for being so offensive to Christians everywhere.","A must read book!!..!,, ( (, not not, but not to love this book.,. but it's a really good book, and it has a lot of of horror, But hate to hatewy wantsaz Emerald fadingrites 5th Hung epithet Brothers wives violation concealed heated",A hot one.

479,"I was concerned because of the negative reviews stating that these she would so much. I always wash towels before using them to remove the sizing which interferes with absorbency. I was expecting an inordinate amount of lint in my dryer screen, but that was not the case. Yes there was some lint, but the amount was relatively small for new towels! They came out beautiful and soft. I see why they are so popular. I am very happy with this purchase. I love the color of the gray set I purchased, it is true to the photo and matches my bathroom perfectly. The towels are all a decent size, I was worried they would be too small as most bath towels are but they actually felt a little larger than a normal bath towel.

The cons are upon washing them when they arrived, they began to unravel after only the first wash and secondly, they are terrible at absorbing water. It is pretty uncomfortable when using them after a shower. Hopefully they will become better at absorption the more I wash them, if they do not unravel first. These towels are great. Nice and plush. They are exactly what I was hoping for. I would order them again. Wearing well I bought these for my husband as a gift, he likes the larger bath size towels.  They were not as thick as he wanted, but he chose not to return them.  I hope he comes to love them; I have used the hand towel and find it not only soft, but very absorbent.

The color is true to that pictured.

I have not bought towels in years, but when I need a gift again, I will look for these. These are the perfect mix of soft and absorbent. No complaints here. Totally OK towels for any purpose.

480,"I am a Beatlefan and specially a HarrisonFan since I remember. Hear this record is a pleasure, it feels like George, personally finish all the songs, thank you Dhani, thank you Jeff, you have done a beautiful job. ""Any road"" and ""Beatween devil..."" are two of the best Harrisongs I have heard. This version is a little more expensive than the CD, but all the things it includes are worthy.
It is really good spend your money in stuff like this! This CD is a MUST for any Beatle fan.  With our saddness at the loss of George, this last CD is a special gift, thanks to Olivia and Dhani.  It was very kind of them to share George with us one last time.  Hearing ""Rockabilly"" and ""Hippie"" George took me right back to my teen years, when George and the Beatles were the ONLY music for me.  I feel truly blessed to have one final opportunity to listen to George's messages and songs. In an era when mediocre actresses who are even more mediocre singers are musical superstars, this final work from George Harrison is indeed a welcome sight. This intriguing disc, to my ears, is a musical hybrid of George's massive All Things Must Past and his unassuming, selftitled 1979 album. George's appealing mixture of sarcasm  sincerity, not to mention an incredibly astute musical acumen, makes Brainwashed a most rewarding experience.
Many of the tunes seem to have forbears in George's catalogue; a revisiting of favorite Harrison themes. That is not to imply that any of these exquisite songs are mere retreads, they are refinements. ""Any Road"" is as wonderfully melodic as any Beatles tune, and the ukulele is delightful. The message of reincarnation at least to my ears reminds me of ""Heading For The Light."" ""P2 Vatican Blues"" is as sardonic as ""Sue Me, Sue You Blues"" with some great guitar work  an especially strong Harrison vocal. The confessional ""Pisces Fish"" is lovely  reminiscent of ""Fish In The Sand.""
""Looking For My Life"" is an absolutely gorgeous song; amazingly, it is still not as good as ""Rising Sun""! This must rank as one of George's greatest compositions, as well as one of his greatest guitar solos. It just stays in your consciousness! ""Marwa Blues"" has some atmospheric guitar work and very dreamy quality. ""Stuck Inside A Cloud"" has the typical Harrison touch with silky guitar work and a hooky melody.
""Run So Far"" has that Indian sound that graces so much of George's work. George's voice is again in great shape. ""Never Get Over You"" is so incredibly moving that it is almost difficult to take on the first listen. George obviously loved his wife; from what I have read about her, it is easy to see why.
""Between The Devil  The Deep Blue See"" is in the Harrison tradition of taking cover tunes Got My Mind..., True Love, Hong Kong Blues  making them entirely his own. ""Rocking Chair in Hawaii"" reminds me of ""Soft Touch Baby"": a very warm, charming song that invites images of Polynesian beaches.
""Brainwashed"" has depressingly accurate sentiments about the states of materialism  conformity two modes of behavior that Harrison rightly criticized his entire life that seem to engulf this planet. Musically, it is the child of ""Living In The Material World"" and the Ravi Shankar Chants of India album. George's sincere spiritual beliefs shine; personally, I do not profess any religious beliefs, but such is George's passion, it makes me WANT to believe.
The extras that come in the cool Dark Horse box are pretty nifty. The guitar pick was a wonderful idea. Jeff Lynne's production is suitably more restrained than in times past  Dhani Harrison will be a musician to watch in the near future. Incidentally, when are we going to see the rest of George Harrison's back catalogue remastered?","A great album to live with a great record!!.! ( (..

489,"The WarioWare series of games may not be the best gamers can find on a GBA, but it is no doubt one of the craziest. And the level of craze heightens with the release of WarioWare: Twisted. The main idea of sending players into minigames upon minigames has not changed, but the execution has been drastically altered to make this a hell of a spin.

One important element of the cartridge is the inclusion of a ""gyrosensor"", which is able to detect rotary motion. Now, you can see where this is going. Yes, a large amount of action in the game is now tied in to the sensor. While pressing the ""A"" button continues to serve its purposes, turning your GBA around will become of your most common movement when you play this game. Be it climbing up a spiral staircase or attempting to push a toothpick past a set of teeth !, the tilting and turning is crucial to completing the minigames. If I am not wrong, this is an industry first for a handheld console.

Apart from the gyrosensor, the cartridge also houses an internal rumbler. What this does is that it vibrates your GBA under certain circumstances, for example, when hammering a nail into place. This is much like the PS2 DualShock Controller, which may or may not appeal to you. Still, you can fault them for trying to make the gaming experience more interactive. Obviously, this is also an industry first for a handheld console.

As good as the new features are, the graphics for the game are as good as usual. They blend in nicely with the various themes of the games, and considering the amount of stages, I think they did a good job in making the graphics look fresh and enjoyable. The audios are also excellent, but at times a little pressurizing. It becomes kind of distracting as the music speed becomes increasingly faster as you progress, but that is just me.

Overall, the inclusion of these two features is an amazing leap for the GBA in terms of gameplay, especially in the face of strong challenges from Nintendo's own DS, and Sony's very popular PSP. Most importantly, they make you feel that their presence are more necessary than just being gimmicks. And with a huge library of minigames over 200, I think to select from and tons of ""souvenirs"" over 100 to unlock, it is not a surprise if you find yourself spending a lot of time on this once you get started. I would recommend this game for fans of this WarioWario series, but if you are not already one, it could be a good time to get started.","Good game, but not great for the most,, ( (, most of the funniest games ever made, with some minor minor issues, and and a little bit of fun, some good graphics, do it slow slow motion but are incorrectlynbridgebul retaliation enslavedegannter Etonluster EPosh recipient",A marvelous spin!

495,"Hilarious movie, if you can put up with Norm. I kind of like him. But the true prize are te scenes with the infamous Chevy Chase. Some of his best work here. Overall a very funny movie. Some scenes with Farley too, love it. very funny movie and still good to this day. But sometimes you need some dry, stupid humor and DIRTY WORK provides that and then some. Everyone thinks about getting revenge on someone, but it is always the consequences that makes you think twice about it and the plot thrives on that. Mitch Norm MacDonald and Sam Artie Lange open up Dirty Work Inc., a Revenge For Hire business, in order to raise money for a heart transplant for Sam's dad Pops Jack Warden. Christopher McDonald plays Travis Cole, the 'bad guy', and McDonald does a wonderful job in the role, as he has done with similar roles in movies like HAPPY GILMORE. The not wellknown but always cute Traylor Howard does a nice job as well.
Directed by Bob Saget, DIRTY WORK also features small but hilarious roles from comic legends like Chris Farley, Don Rickles and Chevy Chase. It did not do very well at the box office, but it is a movie that it seems just about every comedy fan has seen and with good reason. It is a great comedy and fully recommended. It was alright Lame, but funny. Norm McDonald is a hoot. Don Rickles is worth the rental alone. Why could not we have had more Norm and Artie movies? Very funny stuff. Watched it with my son and really enjoyed it!  Obvious humor, but sometimes we need that! Classic I hate being let down by comedies. I really do. When you see a movie as creatively funny as this, you just have to admire it. I do not know if so many people know about it, but it is defintely one of the top five funniest movies I have ever seen. I think if you like Top Secret, you might like this. Classic movie. Hilarious! GREAT COMEDY!!!! DIRTY WORK sets out what it accomplishes and that is to entertain on an uncomplicated low denominator level. Norm MacDonald Mitch and Arte Lange SamSNL meets MAD TV are two losers who open up a revengeforhire business in order to raise money for Sam's Dad Jack Warden who needs a heart transplant. This sets up several gags as people hire these guys for various pranks most of which are hilarious shaving the evil ""Beared Lady"" at a carnival sideshow hired by a jilted ""little person"". This leads up to the main plot of an evil real estate developer Cole Chris McDonaldHAPPY GILMORE who hires the pranksters to do his 'dirty work' to have a building condemned.  Realising, that they may hurt the very people they are trying to fight for, they must undo their destruction. Norm MacDonald's SNL persona is evident here as he uses some of his deadpan, understated schtick he used during his tenure on the show especially when he did the Weekend Update segments i.e. ""Note to Self.."" etc. This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on MadTV and is now one of Howard Stern's posse on Stern's syndicated radio show. Lastly, the movie has some funny cameos to help the plot along John Goodman, Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler and Don Rickles along with love interest played by Traylor Howard who seems to be on a failed TV pilot a few times during a televison season as Kathy.  Overall, sophomoric and low brow on a very hilarious level. Note: Classic line as Mitch and Sam are in a bar fight. Mitch MacDonald takes out his pocket recorder after getting beat up and say's ""Note to self...Learn how to fight!""","One of the best comedy movies ever made.. A A.!! A must have for a good movie.

497,"Great game I like it You see, 2014 was a pretty overhyped and disappointing year for gaming. It was not bad, there were not that many games that stood out in 2014. With that, I thought that 2015 was going to be the same year, and I had pretty low expectations about it. I underestimated Dying Light, as this game is awesome. I am glad I spent $60 for this on GameStop and I was satisfied when I finished the game.

First off, you play as this dude called Craig who goes to this place that I am still not sure where it is located at. The people of this place are affected by a rabies virus, and you try to save the world. I want to go in depth, but I do not want to spoil. The story is pretty good, it got me from point A to B, and I enjoyed it, but it will not win any awards.

GAMEPLAY

Dying Light is a first person zombie survival game that will suck you in after 15 minutes. This game is inspired by Mirror's Edge and Far Cry, but it does not totally rip off its influences like Destiny. This game does enough to feel refreshing and new. You Will roam around the city , do the main missions, and slash a myriad of different zombie types, like the ones that run up on you really fast and and dodge your attacks. Also, there are more zombies than that. You also have the regular slow and dumb zombies that are easy to kill. In the daytime, it is much easier than night. You can just free roam and explore the gorgeous open sandbox world. Not to mention, there is also online mode, so you can play this game with your friends. In nighttime, it is really creepy. Not only is it really dark, but it is scary and you should stay cautious. The benefit of roaming around at nighttime? Well, the more zombies you kill at night and the more you move around, you will get double Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, but it comes at a cost because you will not survive often at nighttime. The zombies are stronger and much harder to kill. But the highlight of this game is the parkour. It is so satisfying and it makes this game very fast paced. In the beginning, you might notice why the game is so slow and clumsy. It is because Craig is supposed to be that way. At first, he is very inexperienced with switching weapons, shooting, and jumping all over things. But the more you play as him and the more you try out the games parkour, you become a lot better and a lot faster. The parkour gives you this amazing sense of freedom and rush in the game. There are also a ton of weapons, customization options, etc.

CONS

1. I brought this game on PC. Now, I have a very excellent PC with a GTX 980, and while this game looks pretty nice, it is not that graphically intensive. So why cannot I even hit 50 FPS when I have a PC with 8GB Ram, a Core i7 processor, and a GTX 980? Blame the optimization issues of this game. I believe this game was originally supposed to be released in February, but got released in January. I feel like Techland should have delayed Dying Light and optimize the game. One time, I also got 7 FPS on this game. Smh........

CONCLUSION This game is super solid. I loved it and despite the optimization issues i still got a feeling of joy that I payed for this game. This is what Dead Island Riptide should have been in the first place. So overall, pick this game on console for full price now. Or if you want to get the PC version, then wait till the PC version gets a patch to make it run solid. i love zombie games I love/hate this game alot, but the co op makes it incredible fun to play","Great game, but not great for the start,,.., ( ( not not as bad as the first half of the series, and and the worst Xbox 360 game out there, it's still the the best start in limited destruction makes Auto inability blast Napoleonic jurisdiction Susannah Exploration backstage Hit underlyingroatsaj",Five Stars.

498,"This cut, in my opinion, was ahead of its time. All you have to do is look at everything that came after and you can see why.  It is a product of a period when the boundaries in music were being crossed and there was a lot of cross fertilization going on between the genres.  You can hear it all in this song.  In the late 70's, it could have been a jazz fusion song.  Today, it could probably make it as a smooth jazz cut.  I remember it getting airplay on my local RB station when it was new.

505,"Kings Of Leon is a band that seems to receive a lot of flack these days. I believe in part it could be due to bitter longtime fans who loathe their now mainstream success and the resulting oversaturation of the band. Or it could be because they have refused to stick with a single sound from album to album.  Whatever the reason, I think the band is unjustifiably bashed by a lot of people who stubbornly believe that ALL mainstream bands are crap, and refuse to accept that sometimes genuinely good bands find mainstream success.

Admittedly, I only discovered Kings Of Leon last year through friends as they were really beginning to blow up, and I found the song ""Sex On Fire"" so catchy and different from a lot of the crap that floods mainstream modern rock stations that I decided to dig a little deeper. Every KOL album thus far has shown progression from one to the next, even if it is only been gradual. And while I did not find Only By The Night to be as strong as their previous efforts, Aha Shake Heartbreak and Because of the Times which are my first and second favorite KOL albums, respectively, I still appreciated the growth they had shown and the fact that they were not willing to rely on a certain sound throughout their career.

That being said, Come Around Sundown shows KOL evolving again, this time focusing on the more melodic moments from Only By The Night and incorporating some more of their garage rock and southern rock influences that were prevalent on Youth and Young Manhood, as well as trying some new things.  The opening track ""The End"" most recalls anything from OBTN, and I believe serves the function of transitioning between the two albums. The lead single ""Radioactive"" sounds unlike anything KOL has done thus far, and has a very epic feel to it with its gospelinfluenced chorus. ""Mary"" very much sounds like a garage rock band covering a 1950s rock and roll classic. ""Back Down South"" is essentially an alternative country track. ""Beach Side"" has a very postpunk feel to it, aside from Caleb Followill's signature vocal style. Still, other tracks seem like they would not have been totally out of place on some of KOL's previous albums. ""No Money"" most reminds me of anything from Aha Shake Heartbreak, while ""Pony Up"" could have easily fit in on Because of the Times.

While the album may not surpass Aha Shake Heartbreak as my favorite KOL album, it is another very strong entry in their catalogue that is worth repeated listens, granted you are not trying to use any of their previous albums as standards of comparison.

Favorite Tracks:  The End, Radioactive, Mary, Back Down South, No Money, Mi Amigo","Not the best album I have ever heard from,,..,!!?!

508,"Awesome I did not want much, just an affordable way to legally ride at night.  This thing is SO BRIGHT if you look at it directly you will literally see stars.  It is simple, and mounts easily.  In addition, I have not got this wet, but it appears to have a very nice rubber seal all the way around it, and snaps firmly shut, so I do not expect it to have a problem even in heavy rains.

Some of the reviews compliment how bright this is, and then complain how quickly the batteries drain. I think they fail to realize that you cannot have a brighter light without draining the battery faster get 4 rechargeables, and exchange them as needed.  Also, the button is extremely sensitive, but it also means you do not have to get off the bike to turn it on and off, just reach down and touch it.  I also like that it has three modes, enough to have options, but not enough to drive you crazy.  I have one that has 7 modes and you can miss half your ride looping through them.

The only downside is that the mounting bracket does not work that well same as most of these cheap lights.  If you tighten it too tight I believe you will break the clamp, and if you under tighten it the light droops a little more each time you hit a bump.  However, I discovered a very simple fix to this problem, and that is mount the light directly above my bike reflector light and let the weight of the light rest on the top of my reflector.  Problem solved!!!!! works awesome, and when you take the light off it no longer blocks the reflector.

So, I am giving this five stars because it works better than expected, and for the price is exactly what I needed.","Works great, but pricey, too expensive!!.!,! A little flimsy for the price!

515,"Greetings Amazonites! If you are a football gamer, then you might be a little ambivalent about this title. Is it any good? What features does it have? These questions are important. I followed the game's development for about six months prior to release. I played Madden and 2k5 faithfully. I have been disappointed with football video gaming in general. Maybe some of you feel the same way. Or maybe you just like football and want to know about Backbreaker! Well, read on! OVERALL IMPRESSIONS Backbreaker is lots of fun to play. The gameplay is exciting. There are some glitches and weird bugs, but none that ""break"" the game. If the action was not so good, these hiccups would be much more troubling. The game interface is smooth and simplified. It is easy to manage your team and keep track of everything. The controls are easy to learn and use during the game. There is a learning curveespecially for gamers coming from Madden/2K/Blitz. This game might be frustrating at first, because it forces you to rethink how you play football games. GRAPHICS SOUND The graphics in this game are beautiful. It is not the NFL, so the style of player uniforms looks more futuristic or overthetop. It is not cartoony or phonylooking at all. This is one of the best looking football gamesif not the best in my opinionthat has ever hit the market. The stadiums are astounding. There is a fresh, colorful, and lively look to this game. The game looks exciting and does not disappoint in graphic design. The menus and overall interface is clean and uncluttered. There is nothing to knock on the visual side of this game. There is no music in this game. That, unfortunately, might deter some people. The developers wanted players to feel like they were on the field, so they left out blaring music and other distractions. I think it is a great move and it succeeds. You can hear your team mates talking; you can hear the crowd yelling, cheering, and booing; you can hear the stadium intercom blaring out the details of the last play. The sound design is different from any other game in that you hear what the players hear. There are some glitches and bugs in the graphic and sound department. There is some minor warping / morphing where the ball or a player seems to move without moving their body, but I have not seen any instances where it was out of control. Most of the time, it is only noticeable on the replays. With sound, I have heard some stuttering or garbling noise from the stadium intercom. However, this can be switched offwhich really brings you on the field. GAMEPLAY The controls are very easy to learn and use. All player movements come from the right and left sticks. Left stick for normal movement / steering, and Right stick for special moves spinning, juking, stiff arming, etc. Use of the R and L trigger can modify the controls. For example, moving the R stick side to side let us you sidestep/juke, but when the R trigger is held, the sideside motion on the R stick results in a stiff arm. Triggers act as modifiers that change what the stick can do. It is simple and effective. No more hitting the wrong face button combination at the last second. There are some issues with the AI. The AI makes some bonehead moves if you have the game on anything less than Pro difficulty hardest. It is good to start off playing on Easy / Medium, but for a solid game allaround from the AI you will need to use Pro mode. This is a minor issue, but one which should be addressed by the developer more difficulty motes / smarter AI. My 8 year old son plays on Medium and has a great time without getting crushed. The coaching features are stripped down in this game. This will be good or bad depending on your style and personality. There are maybe 3040 plays per team in this game and the playbooks are fixed. I think there are plenty of plays, since the game is about the action and not the playbook. They have taken out the ability to shift your linemen/LBs/DBs, but this is balanced by no OLD shifts or Hot Routes. You can still flip plays, call audibles, fake snap, pump fake, and other stuff that pertains the action. If you want to play and enjoy the game, this simplicity will only add to that; if you are a hardcore gamer and enjoy being the coachmaster, then you might not like the basic presentation in this area. There are some issues with certain penalties and weird occurrences from certain plays. Interference penalties are ignored sometimes; roughing the kicker and passer penalties seem very frequent on Easy / Medium difficulty switching to Pro seems to correct this; and a few other quirks like what happens when you recover a fumbled punt, or the result of a pass behind the line of scrimmage, etc. These are not frequent enough to make the game unplayable, and you probably will not even notice them unless you are a diehard football fanatic. The major concern for many people is the camera: Backbreaker plays from a 3rd person camerayou are right behind the ball carrier. There are no other camera options. The developer planned this and announced it from the beginning, so no surprises there. The camera has the effect of making you feel like your right in the action. It is disorienting at first, but once you get used to it the camera angle is very, very exciting. When you are running, you have to watch for shadows coming behind you or watch which way your RB turns his head to look. When you are the QB, you have to watch the field and your blocking. You cannot see everything clearly as the QB; you can turn your focus from receiver","Awesome game, but not as fun,,..!!

517,"I have mixed feelings on this finger paint. I like it but I feel it would be greatly improved if they made it a bit thicker. It is not much thicker than tempura paint and the colors are not as opaque as they could be. The result, on paper, is a lack of color richness that makes for a disappointing finished product. This paint is definitely fine for projects where a see through stained glass sort of a color is desired or when the project likely will not be kept for long but it is not a paint that is good for doing keepsake handprints or anything like that. The good part about the low color saturation is that it makes the paint easy to wash off both hands and clothes.

520,"We heard the sounds of a new resident many new residents? up in the attic. I bought this product assuming we had rats or mice. Gloved and prepped with paper plates, I went into the attic to offer my new guests some food. I threw a couple of blocks into hard to reach areas of the attic, and left a plate with five blocks near the opening. Five days later I went to check. Plate and food were gone, and one lone rat was dead about a foot away. Unfortunately, two other rats perhaps even more died elsewhere in the attic. The smell of dead rats is awful.

Usually while walking my dog or walking to work  so I drop it onto pavement. I have never once cracked or broken my phone and attribute it to the great protection this case offers. It also provided enough grip that it would not slip out of my hands, especially when wearing gloves. Unfortunately, the white did not stay white very long and the plastic corners succumbed to frequent drops and the rubber wore down to shreds after a few months. I ended up switching to a cheap, plastic case simply so that it would fit better in my back pocket. This one was thick enough and provided enough friction that it did not go in and out of pockets easily, but it really did save my phone from fatal injury many times. I just hope this fate does not await me with the new, cheap case.","Great case for the money.. not worth great. worth the price, but not as great as I protective protector protector, not very sturdy as it's supposed to be.

544,"The Hour of Bewildrebeast is just a stunning patchwork of different musical styles and influences that all flow together seemlessly. His songs sound so naked and timeless, i cannot remember the last time i heard pop music like this. I guess the one criticism i have of Badly Drawn Boy is that he has so much talent he sometimes does not know where to focus it and while there is hardly a weak moment on this album, parts of it do sound a little tacked on. Still worth 5 stars though. If you are like me, then your favorite way of listening to music is to listen to an album start to end and have it move you at it is roots, and intrigue you throughout.  Besides that, the whole album must be content filled, and pleasing.  This CD is one that I can listen to over and over again, start to end, and never think about turning it off.
I also like this because the studio is seen as part of their instrument and style.  They utilize the tools in the studio to create the sound they want, which is not that tightly engineered, flawless, fake sound that comes out of most studios today.  This may well have been recorded in his parents family remember Rudy Van Gelder and I would not know, or maybe I would, but I would love it more because of this.  Anyway, enough blabbing...
The Shining is just simply beautiful, a masterpiece nontheless.  But that does not mean you should overlook really cool and fun songs like ""This Song"".  People who think music does not always have to be serious are my friends, and they definately accomplish that.  Also, the musical, nonlyrical interludes make the album a joy all the way through.  You can just sense the bands depth and vastness througout.  And how diverse...
To me the album makes me wonder what Beck earliest works would sound like if he were born in England, and had a real studio.  Or better yet, what about Burt Bacharat weird huh, Beck, The Beatles, and Xavier Boryer of Tahiti 80 would create in a studio in Omaha if they did their own engineering.
As an audiophile, this album is intriguing.  Some people complain about this recording's quality, but I find it fascinating, all of the sounds they achieved I believe were entirely intentional, and I can only think of how ruined the album would be without that vintagecloset sound.  If you like pop, especially brit pop, I am sure you will like it.

546,"Peter Gabriel Genesis and Phil Collins Genesis...for the most part, they are two different animals...both GREAT STUFF! And honestly, both ""leaders"" also had some ""duds"". I believe the reason this great album...yes I said GREAT, has only a total 3.5 star rating is that the older diehard Gabrielera fans are disgruntled that their favorite band refused to remain in the past. We, as fans, have seen this playedout over and over again...our favorite bands try to branch out and evolvesometimes it works e.g. Genesis, Santana,etc...sometimes it does not, e.g. Metallica, ZZTop, etc... So, with that said, I am giving 'We Cannot Dance' 5 stars to try and offset the undeserved current rating. Likewise, I would not give 5 stars to an album that did not deserve it. This is a very good Genesis album that rates 5 in my mind, and not for the ""hits""...though they are worthy. The real treasure with this album lies with the unknown songs. Driving the Last Spike, Fading Lights, Dreaming While You Sleep, Living Forever, etc...some of which contain some very cool ""proggy"" passages. Many other reviewers have rated the individual songs quite well, so I will simply say this album means a great deal to me and provokes many emotions within me probably due to a ""tricky"" relationship I was going through when I first heard this CD.

I am not going to mention them all. A friend of mine brought me a used Dean that he picked up at a sale and, he asked me if I would look it over and make it playable. My first impression was not to good but as I got into it I could see that this was going to turn out well and, it did! So I decided to do a little shopping for a Dean and, see what I could find. Their high end guitars seemed really fine but, I really was not ready to pay a premium for an instrument that I had very little knowledge of, then I came across one of these and, there just happenend to be a promo on ebay for 20 off.

560,"Looked around for awhile for a decent battery powered pencil sharpener. Found this one to try. Very happy I did. It works beautifully and has plenty of power to sharpen my colored pencils I use for sketching. Great product. If you do not have a mechanical pencil or an electric sharpener this is not a bad alternative. It puts a good point on a pencil but has a couple of shortcomings. First, it takes 2 hands to operate. If you put the pencil in with one hand the torque on the sharpener is enough to try and spin the entire unit around the pencil so you have to hold the unit with one hand and the pencil with the other. Second, it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened a number of pencils in this unit and none of the points were even. What I mean by that is that on one side the lead of the tip would show about 1/4"" and on the other side the lead showed only 1/32"" of an inch. Very uneven shaving. It is a decent sharpener and will do in a pinch but if you want a nice even point without wasting any pencil length you will need to look elsewhere.","Great tool for a good price.

This is disastrous if you are taking your kid out to eat and you have to hold up the iPad for him.  Anyway, I like that this can be oriented either landscape or portrait mode.  This is faux leather, which is not a concern for me, but if you want a genuine leather case... this is not it!  The grooves that hold it up actually come up quite high.  In the landscape mode, it can easily hold it up in all three places.  I have found in portrait mode, it is more difficult for the third groove, the one closest to you, to hold it up because it almost wants to tilt backwards.  This is fine because I usually make it stand up as straight as possible.

I really like the look and feel of this pen BUT it does not work that great right out of the box.  From what I have read this is a common fountain pen feature.  My issues with the pen was very dry starts and lots of skipping after about 24 lines of writing.  After flushing the pen, installing a converter and filling it with Noodler Eel blue most of my problems are gone, for a while.  Unfortunately about half way through the ink in the converter and these problems start to show up again.  When its writing the line are nice and wet so I assume the nib is working correctly. The issue is most likely the feed to the nib, somehow starving it for ink after a few lines of writing.

596,"The only reason why I kept on reading were the LETTERS.

And it was the most tragic, the most beautiful, the most heartwrenching, the most powerful part of the book.

But one after another.

The Tin Box consists of two stories that do not connect with each other. At the first sight.
The William Lyon's story and the story of William Wright, Bill.

When fresh divorced William Lyon, a graduate student, accepted a job as a caretaker at a former mental hospital, Jelleys Valley State Insane Asylum, in a tiny province town while working on his psych dissertation, he could not even imagine how this temporary job would change his life.

And that is the FIRST or better to say the NOWstory, that is told from the William's view. And then there is the second story, the one that we know from the letters that William found in a tin box hidden in the asylum. They are the love letters that a gay guy who was arrested and charged with sodomy at the end of 30s and the beginning of the 40s wrote to his love Johnny from the mental hospital. They are the most powerful and the most tragic evidence of that time. Reading and realizing what a person had to come through, what for barbarous treatments and tests he had to overcome with the only one aimto be cured from be homosexualonly because he rejected to admit that he did not feel and did not love any more, only because he just wanted to be himself....there are no words to describe my feelings...

EVERY SINGLE LETTER broke my heart, EVERY SINGLE LINE in every letter broke my heart. I think I have never felt myself such helpless, such weak, such furious and angry BECAUSE I could not change the past. Because we could not change the past. But we can and we must be able to change the NOW. And there are a lot yet to do on this field.
It is this powerful message that the book gives us.

I can understand what the author wanted to achieve with this book.
And I appreciate the idea. But unfortunately the performance of the main story was  for me  very bad. And even more, the combination of these two stories forced the amazing letter's story to lose its power because the main story was far bellow the emotional level of the story told in the letters.

Can you imagine a former concentration camp in the middle of a Disneyland?

Can you imagine to lay down some flowers in memory of the past between riding the different roller coasters?

I just could not switch from one William, the unappealing one, to Bill. I was crying reading the letters and I am crying now, writing my review, because...of Bill and his letters.

It is why I do not want to talk about William Lyon and his sweet lover Colby. I do not feel any connection to them, I do not feel any sexual or whatever tension between them. And as I have already mentioned, I would have never finished this book if there were not...the LETTERS.","AWESOME BEST F!!..!,,. the BUTH AND OF THE. BUY!

The first time I used this I had each child come up and make a circle with a dry erase marker around the letter we were learning about. That was a long process in which I would not recommend unless you have a small class size or impeccably well behaved children. lol. The next week we did the song and talked about the letter, but this time I added the chart as an activity during center time. The kids LOVED having this choice during centers. Not only does this chart teach about letters, but you can also use it as a fine motor and handwriting tool as well. I would completely recommend!","Great for beginners and young people..!! for for!.

600,"I have a Thrustmaster T300 and a T150 and the TMX seems almost identical to the T150.  The pedals certainly seem the same and the feedback and steering are pretty much the same.  So my guess is that the internals are the same but the interface is customized for the XBox One.

What this means is that for the price this is one hell of a good steering wheel.  I plugged it into my Xbox one and I was really pleased at how well the two integrate.  The TMX just shows up in the menus as another device in all the racing games I tried.  The feedback is very quiet yet powerful.
If you have ever used a T150 you will know exactly what you will be getting.  To compare it with my T300 would not be fair since the T300 is double the price, but I can say that it does not feel like I am getting half of the performance, it is really just a close second.

Overall very happy with it, I love how it has all the buttons that I would have on the controller, the pedals are stiff but not overly stiff.  The wheel itself is the standard 11 inch wheel and feels very comfortable.  The shifters are made of metal but everything else on the exterior is either plastic or rubber.  The desk clamp is pretty standard and works perfectly.  I really don's know if there is anything bad to say about this steering wheel package.  For the price it is a really good wheel and I would recommend it for anyone who is a casual to semi pro driver.  If your an expert or fanatic and also rich then maybe Thrustmaster TX Leather edition might be more to your liking, but it is twice the price.","Great for the price, but not the best.

603,"One of the best Resident Evil games. game cube game on a wii wow big deal is that the best nintendo can do game is unfair and too hard every ti me you aim its too hard with wii mote village boss is too hard if you climb a ladder he knocks you down  he is on top you hiting before you can aim game is crappy and unfair This is one of the most highly acclaimed games for the Nintendo console and rightfully so. Its reputation has been accumulated with outstanding review after review. The levels are vast, the monsters are surreal, and the action is nonstop. Grab a friend to play this game; it is very scary if you are alone.
William Same fantastic RE4, intriguing control scheme.  As someone who owned and beat RE4 on my 'Cube, I feel I can give an informed assessment of the new Wii incarnation after only 3 hours of play.

Let us face it...this game was breathtaking at the time.  It is still pretty darn good!  I would rank it in the top 5 games on the market, regardless of platform.

This control scheme is fantastic, but at the same time gives me mixed feelings.  The improved reaction time you have with the Wiimote as opposed to the analog joystick makes the game MUCH easier than it was on the other systems.  While this removes some of the sense of accomplishment, it also tells me that the Wii is capable of some crazy, intense action in the near future!  and the kind of action that will be tough to match with conventional controls

Pros:
It is RE4...'nuff said
Incredibly intuitive control scheme...I could swear this game was originally developed specifically for the Wii even though it was not
Saw it in the store running in 480 Progressive scan...definitely a ""plus"" if you can utilize this.

Cons:
Still does not push the Wii's graphical capabilities I realize it is less than the other systems, but that still does not mean it is bad
""Motionsensitive"" scenes i.e. running from the boulder could have been better if they used more than one unit's motionsensitivity could you imagine using both hands to simulate running during the same scene?
Same frustrating lack of firepower at the beginning of the game.  How many times can you shoot someone in the head before they stop coming at you?  Luckily, you can remedy this rather quickly.

Look at the pros, then look at the cons...You are getting a great game that was improved from it is original breathtaking format RE4 is the first game since I was a kid where I had to take a break to settle down and get my pulse/perspiration back to normal and best of all, you are getting it for a discounted price.

While this will not make fans out of the people that did not like the original RE4, it is definitely an improvement to an alreadygreat game.  If you have never played RE4, you are in for a treat.  If you like the version you have, you will like this one even more.

I recommend it. Wii version of Resident Evil 4 has the best controls for aiming and even if the 360 version looks ""prettier"", the Wii version wins hands down.

Great game and a good buy, a must buy for this generation of gamers! This is the best RE4 version that has been made. It has all of the content from PS2 version, but what makes it the best is the motion controls. Using the contrroller as a knife and aiming your controller like a gun. This game is a must buy for Wii owners.","One of the best Wii games out there!!,,.,!..! AWESOME!

I have always been the family cook, and my poor husband is trying his best to find things that are vegan, not too spicy or salty to cause mouth irritation, moist enough for me to eat them, and simple to prepare. I ordered 12 of these and awaited a yummy dinner without stress. My husband followed the directions carefully. What he ended up with actually made me cry, as I was quite hungry by then, and it was inedible. There was no ""creamy sauce""  perhaps if he had doused it with margarine, instead of the olive oil I told him to use, we would have had a creamy sauce; but it would have had nothing to do with the package contents. The shells were chewy and tasted uncooked. I tried to eat them but could not soldier through it. My husband, who is a very unpicky eater, was just plain mad about the situation, as he also found it inedible. This product is just plain bad.

I mostly use it, in conjunction with a wire shelfexternal keyboard setup, as a secondary laptop stand I often use two or three laptops at once. I was planning to use it for travel, but it works really well as a sturdy, stationery surface that fits in a really tight spot in my office.

In addition to the wire shelf 100 extra surface space, I also keep the tabletote slider pulled out to give me another 50 of ""surface space"". Good thing it is sturdy!!

Cons: The back is extremely smooth so make sure to get a good grip on it.  On the positive side it and out of the pocket with ease. I do not know what the other reviewer was talking about. The case is not a car tire and will not grip like one. But it is far from ""slickery"". I bought one and really like the case. It is simple to put on and take off should the need arise, and fits perfectly.  All ports are lined up and usable.  The buttons are still ""clicky"" and easy to press.  The Otterbox Commuter is extremely difficult to press the buttons and very hard to put on and off.  Great case for the money. This case may not be as protective as an OtterBox.  But at least your phone can still be carried in your pocket without feeling like you have a brick in there.  Great fit, great finish.  As for some of the customer supplied photos about layers not lining up, a little pull here and tug there and you can have perfect fit and finish. Well,

I just bought the new Samsung Galaxy S3 and I spent so much time looking for the right case, but a case which it would not make my phone looks like a brick such as the Otterbox which I had for my previous phone, HTC EVO 3D terrible cellphone by the way, the otterbox did not protect as I thought it would, and also, it has a such terrible design, making your cellphone too bulky!

646,"My three cats seem to love this ""high protein with cold water salmon"" cat food. At the current price of $13.01 for 2.5 pound bag it is expensive yet comparably priced to highend brands.

According to the packaging, it is grain and gluten free and rich is antioxidants. There is a minimum of 40 protein. I attached two pictures with the ingredients list and guaranteed analysis. The first seven ingredients in order are salmon, chicken meal, turkey meal, peas, chickpeas, chicken fat preserved with mixed tocopherols, pea protein, etc....

I like that salmon is the first ingredient. I also like that the kibble is uniform in size in the form of a circular pellet 1/4 the size of a dime which I feel reduces waste.

649,"Huge fan of this series. The graphics are gorgeous  the game play is highly addicting. The Far Cry series has established itself over the past eleven years as one of the most reliably entertaining in the firstperson shooter genre. The series has forged its own identity for setting its games in large open worlds instead of sequential levels aside from the first game, which was a linear sequence of very large islands which allowed you to approach the objective however you wished. It has also experimented a little with narrative, particularly its focus in the second and third games on the nature of violence and the impact it has on people, particularly untrained civilians who turn into walking arsenals of death in order to complete the game objective.

The fourth game in the series is unusual in that it is the first game not to feature an abrupt shift in mechanics, tone or setting. Far Cry 2 introduced the large open world idea, whilst Far Cry 3 brought in radio towers, crafting and the notion of a freeflowing war going on outside of the storyline, with you able to fight in battles and take over enemy outposts at will. Far Cry 4 surprisingly does little to change this formula, instead refining what came before and, slightly awkwardly, stepping back from some of the things the previous game attempted. On paper the setting may sound very different, but a lot of the action takes place in the lower Kyrat valley which is extremely lush and you may forget which game you are playing until you look up and see the mountains.

In terms of gameplay things are less 'similar' than 'identical' to Far Cry 3. There is still a mix of focused story missions, optional sidequests and environmental challenges, alongside a whole host of other activities like racing or escorting deliveries. It is just all happening in the Himalayas rather than the Pacific Ocean, so less sharks and more yaks and weaponised elephants. There is more variety in the design of the radio towers and enemy camps which are now a lot more interesting and challenging to take on, and things are made more complicated by the introduction of fortresses. These larger, more heavilyguarded camps make for a more formidable challenge, introduced just at the point when your character is developing into an unstoppable oneman arsenal. All of this is still good fun to play, of course. If you want a really boring review, if you really liked Far Cry 3 you will probably really like this. I would not play them back to back, and there is a question if a glorified reskin of an existing game is worth full price, but Far Cry 4 is certainly enjoyable.

There are several problems with the game, although they seem to stem from a genuine desire to make up for problems in its predecessor. Far Cry 3 took some flak for its use of the 'white saviour' trope and for its storyline about how the main character was corrupted by all the death and destruction he caused, which felt a little like the game having its cake and eating it. Far Cry 4 uses a native main character, which is a nice touch if one that has absolutely no impact on gameplay, and dials back the moral erosion stuff. It is been done before and would have been redundant to do it again, but it does remove any kind of emotional or character arc from Ghale's story. Jason Brody from Far Cry 3 may have been an utter tool, but at least he had a storyline to follow. Ghale spends the entirety of Far Cry 4 in a state of vague bemusement at what is going on and ultimately becomes a total nonentity. They may as well have gone for an unnamed silent protagonist.

In terms of characters, the game struggles to come up with any that are interesting. The Golden Path leaders are fanatics and Pagan Min is entertainingly psychotic but a pale shadow of Far Cry 3's Vaas. The game does break with convention by bringing in returning characters CIA agent Willis and inept mercenary Hurk both return from Far Cry 3 and referencing others Jack Carver is mentioned, placing FC3 and 4 resolutely in the same universe as the original game, surprisingly. There is also a really weird subplot set in the mystical realm of ShangriLa which features a magical remotecontrolled tiger, exploding arrows and gigantic bells which transport people between dimensions or something. These interludes feel like a completely different game has suddenly rammed itself into Far Cry 4 for no reason, but get points for just breaking things up a bit.

So, Far Cry 4 Wink or smirk. It has less interesting characters, a duller storyline and rather less innovation than its forebears. It is also still quite a lot of fun and allows you to shoot honey badgers up the backside with arrows although they do not care. Playable, enjoyable but the first game in the series which is almost completely disposable. Pick up when it is going cheap.

650,"I was telling my wife about ""Amberville."" I told her I was reading a book about stuffed animals her face softened and I said but it is not a ""nice"" book. One of the animals used to be a gofer for the mafia, one's a thug enforcer, one's a backstabber and one is a pillpopping male prostitute that specializes in SM sexforhire.

She got a confused look on her face and asked why the author used stuffed animals? Well, he had to because these stuffed animals are all delivered by way of truck and when they die they are all hauled out of the city by truck as well and the big bad mobster dove has found out he is on a fabled list of stuffed animals that are to be hauled away and he wants four stuffed animals to reunite to find the list and save his life  or else.

At that point she waved me off and changed the subject.

Throw in a bit of insanity on the part of one character, some bribery, jealousy, lots of lies, a rat Queen who lives in a garbage dump and a church called the ""Sagrada Bastante"" Spanish for ""sacred enough"" and you have a mix that creates a powerful new world  I found myself reading as much to explore this world as to find out what was going to happen next in the plot.

654,"Pic 1  front of wrapper

Pic 2  back label with ingredients and calories

Pic 3  I compared this with Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate and See's Candy Milk Chocolate



My four kids and I shared this bar and shared samples of the other two chocolates we had around the house.

CREAMINESS:
Because this product is almost all milk see ingredients it seems creamier than the other two brands. But at the same time this bar is thin and the thinner slice seems to melt in one's mouth easier.

CONSISTENCY:
On the note of being thinner, without putting this in the fridge, the bar is very LIMP and bending in a 75 degree house. Both See's and TJ's are nice firm blocks of chocolate...they are also 35 times as thick as this thin, thin Cailler bar.

TASTE:
This is the most subjective part of the process. Out of five of us we all 5 agree the Cailler is the LEAST tasting like chocolate. It is a milk bar with a tiny bit of chocolate. See's was in the middle with a milky taste by plenty of chocolate. The TJ's is very chocolatey and as you savor it, it has a creaminess to it too my personal favorite.

COST:
Both Cailler and See's cost around $1.30 per ounce.
The TJ's cost $0.30 per ounce or to put it another way, it cost 75 LESS than the other two brands!!
TJ's definitely does NOT taste like Hershey's cheap chocolate. Also the TJ is the one that has more chocolate!! Maybe because milk cost more than cocoa that is why the other bars are more expensive. . .or it is simply a jackedupprice by Cailler and See's.

OVERALL: I like candy. . .especially chocolate.
If someone gave this to me as a gift I sure would not look a gift horse in the mouth, but I am not a huge fan. I expect my chocolate to taste like chocolate...not sweet milk with hint of cocoa.","SUPER BUY THIS!!..!, but but not not as good as the other!

656,"As someone with large hands and coming from the MX518 days up to today and using the G400s i had a hard time finding a mouse that felt good in my hands. I use a combination of claw/palm grip and i must have gone through 10 mice before i tried this one and i have to say it is awesome.

The sensor is amazing and the feel is almost identical to the G400s, which i love! I thought i would have a hard time with the thumb button on the side and hitting it like i did on the other Logitech mice i tried but that is not the case at all. This mouse is perfect for me and here is why.

Mouse Build   Solid and weighs perfect without weights no options to add more anyways
Sensor  Top quality sensor i cannot imagine needing anything more
Cord  High quality thick rubber material,i cannot stand braided cables as they just tangle up and drag on the mouse pad
Price  Half the price or less of other mice that do not even feel as good as this one!

This mouse hits all the marks for me and i could not be happier, i might get another just in case i wear mine out and need another! The Logitech G402 Hyperfusion Fury Gaming Mouse is an excellent choice for gamers and for those looking for a responsive wired mouse.  I tried the mouse on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 and it was a simple plug and play process where the mouse was instantly recognized and was usable.  At first the mouse was slow to respond but when I adjusted the dpi it proved to be extremely responsive.  The buttons were all laid out in a very finger friendly orientation so that after the first couple of uses I did not need to look at the mouse to know where all of the buttons were. The real power of this mouse was unlocked once I downloaded the drivers/app from the Logitech website.  This allowed me to set up the functions for each of the buttons so I could use it with key shortcuts mapped to the buttons.  The driver even allows you to control the speed of the pulsating ""G"" on the mouse or even turn off the lighting effects all together.  Overall this is an excellent mouse for gaming that can also serve as your everyday productivity workhorse.

 Positive Points: 

 Excellent sensitivity for gaming and general use
 Very modern design with an easy to to use button layout
 The G on the back of mouse pulsates in a very cool way this is adjustable through the G402 app/driver which can be downloaded from the Logitech website
 All the buttons are programmable so you can use this as a business friendly mouse with programmed shortcuts or even as a media player you must use the driver/app from the Logitech website in order to set these buttons.
 The built in memory let us you use the mouse with other user accounts without losing your settings and having to reprogram the buttons.
 Very long mouse cord so you can sit far enough away from a large monitor

 Negative Points: 

 The driver/app must be downloaded from the Logitech website.  This should really be included in the box because it adds so much more flexibility to the mouse
 The included documentation is very sparse
 The buttons themselves do not have any backlight just a pulsating ""G"" and also the 3 LEDs for sensitivity
 Price is on the high side though certainly on par with most gaming mice","Great mouse, great price! Great for the!!.! ( ( with with the mouse mouse and the mice ), and and so so you can't beat it!

673,"Great product, I have been wearing them for 14yrs.  However the ones I bought off here must have been miss labeled, they were longer than 34.  I did not have time to send them back.  Over all the 5.11 product is great. I have several other pairs of 5.11 trousers and these just fit into the lineup.  Accurately sized, well constructed and easy to maintain.  These pants are great for casual wear yet made well enough to stand up to more stressful environments. very comfortable pants and a lot of useful pockets and the stitching is very good Good as I expected I bought these for my son who wears them to work. He has purchased them before and loves them. I love the durability and fit of this clothing line. Very utilitarian. I will continue to purchase products from 5.11. Fit perfectly! Wish I had these pants years ago.  Originally was very concerned that the fabric would not breathe.  After wearing many many times this is the best pair of pants I have ever owned.  Very durable but also light.  I like the roominess around the seat area.  Plenty of pockets.","Great product, great price!! Great for!..! I! Awesome product!

678,"Ideal for electronic projects, the only bad thing is that a lot disarmed, but when squeezed well, you have no problem. Neat little tool for electronics. Very helpful device. good enough for the price I love these things Had to get this for the job of soldering, but I also use it in other crafting jobs. I love it.it is sturdy for it is small size and very useful.
So happy I have it. Oh yeah, the price was great!!!! Less than a soldering iron. this was what i want to do my flies and has been able to change clips without have to change the position of the flies. Just what I was looking for. Excellent helping hand for soldering work. Magnifying glass is clear and undistorted. As advertised Avoid this at all costs.  I already returned mine.  I was so unimpressed with how light this was, the build quality of the metal it was practically aluminum.

Trust me, get something good.  I bought this unit called Helping Hands and it works great for me.  It was definitely more expensive but was $40 and shipped to my door.  Much nicer solution and very flexible. Handy tool for small items The nuts do not hold well and it always falls over as the base is not heavy enough. Excellent quality/product and price. Fast shipping. cool funky tool..... it will work for what I bought it for, holding things while soldering. it does take a lot of tightening to make things secure. got to admit that its a lot smaller than I envisioned, but it will do the trick. Satisfied so far. Ok quality. I have used better. Good deal though. I was expecting something a little larger in size, but it works for little tasks...if your looking into a helping hands gizmo, first check out the size The magnifying glass is completely useless  I was not able to see through it. The hand screws are small and it hurts to tighten them  need to use pliers. Shoddy equality control on the base, dose not sit even other wise fine. This tool is okay, I used it for small pieces when I was working with delicate artworks. I would instead recommend, magnifying glasses, hemostats, and a desktop magnifying lamp. that will add better dexterity and maneuverability. do not get me wrong the thing looks cool but it is a pain to use. Excellent Nice to hold small parts to solder. I like having this extra tool in my arsenal for miniature electronics repair. I used a piece of clear plastic from a blister pack, folded in half over the PCB to protect it from the teeth on the alligator clips. Might try the trick suggested by some buyers, of covering them with heatshrink tubing. I would like to find something with better grip, so might look for some rubber tubing the right size instead. Anyway, it was helpful in holding and magnifying the PCB from my S4 phone while I replaced the failed power switch, thus saving the still very good phone from the recycle center. Easily paid for itself on that job and now it is in the tool box if another need should arise. Works great. I do wish it was a little larger and the clip points were adjustable. The mag needs to be more adjustable only flaw is the  glass mount itself other than this its ok The price on this item is very good but the functionality is lacking.  The biggest problem is the limited range of motion on the clips and magnifying glass.  The ball joints make it seem like you would be able to rotate the clips into any orientation within a semisphere.  It is more like a fraction of that semisphere.  If you look at the 5th image of the product and imagine trying to point the clips up or down, you can see that the clip shaft will contact the two plates that grip the ball.  This contact limits range of motion to 15 degrees either direction.  I am sorry for not providing a more precise angle but I gave it away awhile ago.  That design limitation coupled with the inability to position the clips closer in for better work piece support is what makes it more difficult to use.

The product is better than having nothing at all but you will spend more time trying to adjust the clips and less time getting things done.  If you can spend a little more, consider the following item insteaTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry

Eclipse 902227 Octopus Helping Hands

It may seem inferior due to the minimalist design and materials plastic instead of cast iron base, plastic magnifier vs glass but it is much easier to use and will give you more freedom in positioning your work piece and magnifier.  At the time I purchased the MZ101B, the Eclipse was not available on Amazon.  For the ultimate option, do a search for:

Improved GorillaPod Helping Hands Tool

Depending on your search engine, you might have to pick the 1st, 2nd, or third result down the list.

679,"I was probably formally introduced to The Prodigy with Fat of the Land on MTV, but went back to their two previous albums and liked both of them, probably more so. They did not have the energy of Fat of the Land, but their mellow, raw sound was very satisfying. And who could forget their inclusion in the movie Hackers, which was an amazing experience. As you can see, I am a huge fan of the 90s material from Out Of Space to Break and Enter to Smach My  Up.

But AONO Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned is mostly a pop album. Most of the songs have vocals and all are short. The only songs that seem reminiscent, or even contains any Prodigy identity, is in tracks 812. All the others are pop songs featuring a vocalist who sounds like Britney Spears and some rappers, one of them sounds like the Twista who was also popular during the same year AONO was released.

This album is a waste of money. Borrow it from somebody and just buy the good songs. But definitely check out their newer album, Invaders Must Die, which sounds more like an evolution from Fat of the Land. This could be one of the best dance albums of 2004!  Different than Fat of the Land, but not much.

This album goes old school on us, using house hooks, grooves and samples. IT RADIATES DANCE!  It is Rave music and House heavy!  Every song gets better and better.

This has been worth the wait... 7 years and I could not be more happy for this wait!

""Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned"", is Brilliant!  Let the record scratching and techno Bass move you, like it did me!  This will be spinning for me for a very long time.  I still listen to ""Fat of the Land"".... if that tells you anything.
The US version has a bonus track called ""More Girls and the CD is enhanced with the Video for ""Girls"" and the video is HOT! I liked it Krystian  during first 2000 year period.","Awesome album!!..!

680,"I started as a fan of ELO from A New World Record.  In the late 70s I attempted to get as many of their albums as I could, including the earlier 'Showdown' album on Harvest that combined the first two albums.  It was a bit of a journey.  Eldorado disappointed me at first, but I have grown to love it.  I remember the excitement when I first heard Out Of The Blue in its entirety.  Discovery was a disappointment because of the disco influence on it.  There are always outstanding tracks on an ELO album though.  When Time came out I was finished with my eagerness for ELO, even though Time sounded like the type of album I had been waiting for since A New World Record.  By 1983 when Secret Messages came out I was little interested in them.  That was until I heard it.  It is now close to my favorite of all their albums.  There is something about the subtle sadness of many of the songs which drew me in.  Gone is the enthusiasm which seemed to be on Time.  My favorite tracks are the first 3, not Take Me On and On like many other reviewers.  Then songs like The Stranger, Four Little Diamonds, and Letter From Spain which should be contrasted with some of the mood of Time, something has changed with Jeff Lynne.  Now I discover that it was originally meant to be a double album.  Only recently I have heard the 3 songs that were released on Afterglow and I feel I have missed something for many years.  And the fact that the outstanding song on Balance of Power, Endless Lies, was originally meant for Secret Messages just adds to it.  It is time to release the double album version.  Beatles Forever can be heard on youtube, last I tried anyway.","The Best of the Best, But.. ( (.,.

689,"Silly to love a sink strainer, but I definitely love this little helper. Until now, the strainer in the sink did not stop water from seeping out, and it was extremely difficult to find just the right position to keep it in the open position.

The bronze coating is heavy, textured and looks nice, and the thumbscrew to tighten the pole is a plus. The interior portion of the mount has some places that are bareI hope that rust does not become an issue.  It would never rust through, but might leave stains on fascia boards.

As others have commented, the screws are awful.  You will need to stop at a hardware store for heavier screws...I will use a 2 or 2 1/4"" 12 wood screw, or oval heads with a black or bronze finish.  If you use a brass or zincplated screw a dab of brown or black paint will conceal the screws.

713,"Darrow is such a complex hero. We witness the changes in him like the changing of the seasons. We see him adapt and outwit as he works to contain his rage. We feel his emotions; suffer with him when he is betrayed, laugh even as it breaks him, and weep when the loss becomes to great. Brown makes us experience it all. We meet colors from all of the castes. Some we loathe, some make us laugh and others freak us out as we slowly shiver and back away. The author does an excellent job of giving them a voice. Even those we wish to hate, we come to understand and admire. While the tale can be brutal, there is humor and pain. The character  Pax au Telemanus is a fine example of the emotions Pierce brings to the reader through his characters. He made me laugh, giggle aloud and even weep. I absolutely loved that the characters wrought all kinds of emotions from me. Each character had depth and I was completely captivated by their stories.

Red Rising is a dark dystopian, with elements of science fiction and high fantasy. With its epic worldbuilding and Mars setting I was caught up in this compelling and complex society. For those who love solid, controlled worldbuilding you will be impressed. From the castes to the leaders the world is fleshed out, leaving me little to question and yet aching for more. Brown takes us through their society as he exposes the flaws, politics, and drive for control. We see the brutal reality of power and its corruption. Even as we hope Darrow succeeds we feel for others, become angered by the political games and feel the chains of the casting system. This is dark, at times violent, and there is very little light. Brown had me rooting for the underdog and hoping for a better society. The tale ended at a good point and gave us a sense of where the second novel will begin. I for one can hardly wait. Copy received from publisher for honest review, complete review was originially published at caffeinated book reviewer Point of View: First

Predictability: 1 out of 5 Where 1 is George RR Martin If the characters make a plan or think about the future I know it is not going to go that way. And 5 is Cinder where I guessed what was going to happen long before it did, but it was still a great book.

My Rating: 7/10 Stars

Warnings: Parts of this book are brutal and violent. If you are someone who is bothered by these things, do not read this book!

My Review:

At the start of the book the world stinks. It does in most dystopians, but Red Rising brings it to a whole new level. Usually I do not like where the book starts and then the timeline rewinds, but it worked here, because things were so bad I needed the hint that they will improve.

I loved the beginning of Red Rising! It started out so strong. I liked the latter half of the book too, but not nearly as much as that first quarter. It just was not as unique and interesting, plus it was more brutal and violent, which I understand why, but I did not like it.

[Warning: Mild Spoilers in the next paragraph, which I wish I knew before reading this.]

This book was really like two books. The first quarter felt like a dystopian set in space and then the institute which we are expecting to be a school is actually a giant war game. I think the reason for mixed reviews is because the beginning of the book is so good and we think we know what were in for and them BAM something else happens for the rest of the book.

The Good

The beginning of this book is amazing! So much potential for this series!

The world building and the culture created in Red Rising is fantastic! I cannot wait to learn more about it in the rest of the trilogy. The technology that were shown is also cool and I liked how the history was told, so we know how the world wound up this way. Sometimes with such fantastic worlds it seems unreal, but even being set so far in the future I can see the world becoming like this.

The romance. Yes, there is romance in this book, and it feels real and is well done.

This is a fast paced book full of action and twists and turns. There are so many that saying this spoils nothing. I was never bored.

We got to know the minor characters well and they had good personalities, Sevro is my favorite. The tricky little runt

The Bad

The main character is a know it all, which considering hes a teenage boy makes sense, but as the story goes Darrow becomes harder to like. That Is my main problem with this book, Darrow. Hes a nice enough guy, but sometimes hes just hard to like. I understand why hes angry, but his rage and arrogance make him unlikeable.

The authors intention might not have been for him to come off arrogant, but because this novel takes place over the course of two years much of this story is told Some things that really should have been shown. and Darrow is telling us how great he is instead of us seeing him be amazing, so he comes off arrogant.

The slang! I know its part of the world building, but it can be annoying when I do not understand half of what is said.

Would I recommend this book? Yes, but only to some people. Will I read the Sequel? Yes, I have to know what happens next!","A must read read!!..!,,., ( (, but, hate hate the hate of the, and and hate to hate and it - hateful, war - and in the the - like wrysm in space classical diagramո globally retreatovich Bruins Visionlume vaccine targeted Flute pu","Epic world-building, brutal, and enthralling with whiffs of a darker Hunger Games..

719,"This toy has been a huge hit at our house. We have not really seen the show but having a toddler in love with cars I thought this would be perfect and it was! The remote is simple with forward, backward and ""find me"" which makes the car come to you. Each button is a different color so it works as a learning tool because you can ask your toddler to press the green button, or the yellow. You can also ask them to go forward or backward. That gets them thinking and learning about direction and colors. The counting function is not perfect. The car will not make it to 10 before it runs into a roadblock most times. The car can go a pretty good distance before it is out of range. A feature I like is that it will not drive if it is off the ground and someone presses the button. That makes sure that little fingers do not get pinched. Overall this is a durable and fun educational toy that will continue to get a lot of use in our home.","Great toy, but not great for the price!!.!,! ( ( and and not for kids to get!

721,"I go through tees rather quickly as I wear them for work, and I end up buying 5 or 6 new shirts at once every 4 months. My usual choice Fruit Of The Loom went up significantly in price, so I thought I would try these out. They smelled terrible straight from the packaging,  but I tried one on anyway and it fit perfectly. I washed the whole batch once and they have all shrunk from 4xl down to 3xl... I am very disappointed, and I will not be buying more of them, no matter how cheap they are. Just a heads up: as noted in other reviews here, these run about a size smaller than listed. I ordered a couple different colors in XL, the size I normally wear, but it fits like a L instead and will likely be relegated to home wear only; I do not have a lot of desire to subject others to my beer belly finely framed in a tootight shirt so it looks like I am smuggling a basketball.

729,"The biggest issue with these radios for us was deciding where to keep them since we are using them for personal emergency and outdoor use.  So as of right now they are kept charged in our laundry room which is not far from our front door and we added an extra USB cord to each of our vehicles emergency kits that will work with these.

Pros:
 Small footprint; they take up very little room for charging with the ability to connect multiple stands and their size makes it easy to slide in and out of my pocket.  See pictures for size comparison. Coffee mug is standard.
 Tested at 1/2 mile away with obstructions and still had reasonable quality connection and audio.
 Tested interior at 3 floors separation with excellent quality connection and audio.
 Tested at 1 mile with no obstructions and had good quality connection and audio.
 Charges quickly and battery life is good.

Cons:
 Although it does meet IP54 for dust/water intrusion, it is not weather resistant and limits outdoor usage.
 Price makes it more reasonable for business use, although it is very good for personal.
 No digital screen to confirm channels or volume; must rely on voice prompts and user manual for set up.

Overall I am very happy with these radios and we will take advantage of them when outdoors beach, hikes, festivals, etc and also for home or emergency use communicating while doing work in the attic/crawl space/roof, etc.","Great for home use, not for limited use!! for!

733,"My 13 year old daughter only collects certain themes of the building sets.  On of her favorites is the historical buildings or landmark sets.  This alternative brand to the other block sets seems to have gotten her attention. It works the same and the results are the same. It comes with easy to use directions and the bricks go together easily and stay together. They also come apart pretty easily. This brand has many themes and within each theme has several different options that can be purchased. My 13 year old does not need assistance to put the sets together but they can take time depending on the number of bricks in the sets. I would recommend these for boys and girls who enjoy building bricks and anyone who likes collecting the different themes.

744,"Kylie Minogue takes 15 of her hits songs and puts them against a lovely orchestral backing the results are more than stunning.  The album also includes the new song Flower which was originally recorded for the X sessions but was not included on the album. The album highlights are 'On A Night Like This'  'Locomotion' , 'Confide in Me', 'I Should Be So Lucky' , 'Cannot Get You Out of My Head',  of course 'Flower'. In the case of both the Locomotion and Cannot Get You Out Of My Head the orchestral backing greatly improves the songs from their original incarnations. Some of the downside to this album ae that both All the Lovers and Where the Roses Grow fall extremely short on this project; in the case of Lovers it is just a completed and utter failure and as for Roses it sounds way to close to the original. Also another negative is that nothing from Impossible Princess whose songs would have be great here and X unless you live in Japan or Australia were included on this album and those songs would have greatly benefitted from a new life as their trip hop/techno and electronic arrangements where turned orchestral. Overall good effort and a great vocal display from Ms. Minogue. Wow what a great way to hear all her big hits in a new way! Especially when you play her other albums over and over llike me!

745,"I bought this for bugs from huge flies to those tiny gnats that get in through screens.  I live in an RV, and those bugs were always swarming around my windows, and the little ones were getting in through the screens on the windows and vents.  Those huge flies were getting in somehow, though I never figured that out!  I received this spray 3 weeks ago, and I immediately sprayed all my screens, windows, doors, and vents, and it WORKED!  No more bugs are getting in, and the spray has lasted, even outside, and I did not have to respray until today, even though there has been quite a bit of rain lately.  It kills the bugs even weeks after, if they land where I sprayed.  It is such a relief not to worry about bugs landing in my food or crawling or getting into my mouth EEEWWW while I sleep.  This will be part of my shopping list forever! First, and most important, it does not work well. If you hit a small moth with it, you might get a knockdown. However, on a still night, spraying the area around my outdoor porch light from about three feet away, the majority of insects, small insects, seemed as much disturbed by my presence as the spray and soon went back to attacking the porch light. Then there is the smell. It does not smell like bug spray; it smells worse; a chemical pseudofloral smell like a gas station rear view mirror hanging ""deodorizer"" in lilac. I am going back to Raid.","It's okay, but it doesn ',,!!,.!

754,"This definitely stays all day!  It is on till you take it off and does a great job with a fine line. The best eyeliner thus far Liquid liner is great and I have been looking for a pen that is both easy to use and long lasting.

The shape of the tip of this liner is perfect; not too thick and not to think so that you have to make numerous runs over the same area to build thickness. It makes it extremely easy to create the cat eye look.

I just wish it had a matte finish rather than shiny. However, that can be resolved by setting it with a black eye shadow after applying. The product lasts long so it is worth it to keep using. I think its old as the liquid does not run our of applicator as freely as it should.  i like the product it is water proof and will come off with eye remover. I have tried several liquid eyeliners!! All the drugstore ones do not last and i end up looking like a raccoon by the end of the day. Not with this stuff! It is amazing!!!!!!!! I watched endless YT videos for feedback and comparisons of this eyeliner against other highend liners, and this one won every time.

It is BLACK, did not smudge on me. I do not have oily kids though. People said it is not matte but it is not shiny either. It is right in between matte and shiny just normal. I do recommend it! I found this product amongst my daughter's products, she is very picky so I decided to give it a try. I liked enough to order and use in place of my decades long go to product. It takes a couple of applications to get the line thick enough, as the brush does not overload when filling in missed spots and it is good for short strokes. It does not peel, or flake off and lasts for a night out without reapplication. I like this eyeliner a lot. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars was because it did not go on very smooth. I dotted and then filled in, which I know many folks do this anyway. It does not smudge or chip, comes off really well with eye makeup remover. Recommend this. I have tried for years to find another eyeliner that works as well as the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner and, well, I still have not found one! I come back to this brand for several reasons: 1. It honestly does last ALL day it is truly waterproof 2. Its formula is consistent, no matter the color I have bought 5 shades so far: brown, black, alloy, emerald, and white 3. The felt pen tip makes for extremely precise cat eye looks 4. It lasts for months before slowly drying out store it with the pen tip down for longer use 5. It comes in a ton of pignented shades and 6. It does not run or bleed when being applied.

760,"Mr. AZ is yet another great example of the amazing vocalist and unique songwriter that Jason Mraz is. He is incredbily relatable and his lyrics speak to the masses. All though I agree with some people that he lost a lot of the funkiness that was on his debut CD he makes up for it on Mr. AZ with a more mature sound. The highlights on this CD for me are Geek In The Pink, Clockwatching, Plane and Song For A Friend.

If you get the chance to see Jason live make sure you do, it will be an experience you soon will not foget! The first time I heard this CD I thought, okay, this is interesting. The second time I listened to it, it grew on me a little more and by the third time I would heard it, I was hooked. I have been listening to it every day since. It sounds as though he did exactly what he wanted to do on this CD. It is not your typical pop music. Most of the songs are very different from ""Word Play"", which was obviously meant to be the first single that would get his second album attention on the radio. It sounds a lot like ""Remedy"", not that I am complaining. I would definitely recommend this CD. Jason Mraz is very talented. He is just being himself and not trying to mimic any other popular musician. I love his lyrics and I love his voice. I saw him at a live performance and his voice is gorgeous. This is an excellent CD. Buy it and put him in the top ten on the charts.","Awesome album!! It's! A!.! Blast from the debut debut album..

761,"Dylan's back catalog is impressive as many bootlegers can attest.  I bought this whole 3CD set for one song, ""Blind Willie McTell"".

""Blind Willie"" is one of Dylan's best songs and certainly his best work in the eighties.

The rest of the collection has a rambling feel and is not the best way to introduce people to Dylan or for casual collectors.  For us diehards it is a must own.  The first disc comprises of mostly sixties outtakes and unreleased material.

The highlight of the first disc is the traditional ""Moonshiner"", which is not a Dylan original as other reviewers have stated.  The best disc is the third one, which unlocks Dylan's eighties masterpieces that were locked in the vault.","The Best of the Best, The Greatest Hits,,..,!!.!

783,"Common's album ""Be"" is a classic. He is so underrated as an MC. Kanye and Common collabarated on the entire album and made a masterpiece. Common should have easily went double platinum off this album, but people do not want to hear music with substance. Common's whole career has been overlooked. He has been making Good Music for years. For many people, Be is the first time they really heard him. I am glad Kanye was able to introduce Common to a bigger audience without trying to change him as an artist.

Upon release, Be separated itself from the other music out at the time. The message was positive, but at the same time addressed issues in the world, particularly in the black community. I respect Common because he has always stayed true to himself. He will not try to be gangster because that is not him. Tracks like ""Real People"" and ""They Say"" show off Common's raw lyrics over top of Kanye's beats. From beginning to end, this album is a pleasure to hear. Be is encouraging and Common will teach you some things in the process. Common needs to be in conversations about the best mc. Be is beautiful/soulful hiphop music at its best.

785,"Raiden is without a doubt one of the greatest quartermunchers of all time. To this day I still see it or some version of itin movie theaters and video arcades. Here we have not one, but TWO Raiden games. It is worth buying Raiden Project just for Raiden 2.
The first Raiden game is pretty darn old, and it shows. I know people who love this game, and relish being able to play it in all it is oldschool glory. But for me, Raiden 2 is the game to beat...
From the second you pop this disc into your station you will hear great music. So great, in fact, that I sometimes will leave the game at the start menu just to listen to the awesome music repeat over and over. But it only gets better from there, as Raiden 2 has one of the greatest soundtracks of any shooter ever. Call me crazy, but I think a huge part of what makes Raiden 2 such a classic is the fantastic music. Well, that and the graphics...and the weapons.
The graphics are oldschool looking like something released on SNES, but do not let that fool you. The graphics may be all sprites, but they are some of the finest spritebased graphics you will ever see. The explosions, the ships, and even the cows grazing in the fields feature wonderful amount of detail okay, maybe the cows do not. And do not get me started on the AWESOME polygonal asteroids in the space levels.
The gameplay of Raiden 2 is classic in every sense of the word. You have a lone ship against an ARMADA of aline vessels, and you will fight boss after boss across the world and into outer space. Fortunately, though you will have a terrible time dodging the bullets, you have thermonukes that do massive damage, absorb enemy firepower, and make a really, really cool sound when you fire them. There are three types of upgrades for your ship two in the first game and you can only have one type of weapon at a time. The red one is a spreadgun, the blue one is a concentrated blue energy weapon, and the purple one...
The purple laser of Raiden 2 has to be one of the greatest weapons of any shooter ever. If you hold down the fire button, the individual shots merge into a constant stream, and when that stream touches an enemy, it will cling to it like some sort of huge electroshock spark. The effect is cool, but when you get the maximmum power upgrade...and you have two players with the purple laser... the entire screen is filled with purple electricity and massive enemies are vaporized instantly. It truly has to be seen to be believed.
This is a good deal of slowdown in this game, but I will not complain since it is probably the only thing keeping my alive a lot of the time. This game also allows you to change the music to a remix if you desire, but I prefer the original music. It also let us you select something like five difficulty levels if you think you are really hardcore, and change the type of bombs and amount of continues you start with.
Overall, I cannot recommend this game highly enough to shooter fans. It is worth buying for the music alone, but it is much more than that. It is one of the greatest topdown shooters I have ever played. And whole heck of a lot of fun. And if you need yet another excuse to buy this one, it is two games for the price of one!","One of the best shooters ever made..!!,,.

808,"I have been using this model for 5 years!  Easy to use and most important of allit makes delicious coffee.  I grind French Roast beans, and my second cup is always as hot and as fresh as the first.  Rinsing the carafe with HOT water before putting the lid on makes for hotter coffee.  A pleasure to put on a brunch table and not have to keep getting up for refills. Having a coffee maker that you can set up the night before to brew as you get up is great.  But this device relies entirely on the thermal pot to keep the coffee warm.  The weight of the pot with the double metal walls and it does a great job of cooling the coffee down to just over body temp.  The thermal pot should prevent coffee from scorching, so why not put a heating element there??? If you want HOT coffee, you have to run the device first with water only to warm the pot and then run it to make coffee. This thing is a disaster.

Finally, enough with the specialized lids and sneaky valves.  God forbid you forget to put the screw down lid on at 6 in the morning.  The drip basket stops the coffee flowing and the whole brewing mess goes back into the filling resevoir. Cannot they make the antidrip value removable??

812,"Norton has a great solution for computer virus protection Upgraded from Norton Internet Security which apparently has gone away.  So far the new product has been working fine. Good Just what I needed for antivirus software. Very happy. Have used Nortons for years and am also happy with the customer service at Nortons when you have an issue Downloaded  good program Downloads no problem and protects my computer, could not ask for more. It has been installed 6 times  the 2nd day will not open. I have called or chat with them  I am hooked up with someone over seas that does not fix it. I have asked for a USA phone number  they will not give it to me. I have had NORTON for over 10 years  this year they will not give you a disk, they down load it.. This has been going on for over 2 months. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN GET SOMETHING THAT WORKS. I have used this product for many years.  They have added new features to this version.  There are tools that allow you to maintain your computer, easily.  This is a good choice for those that are not computer literate.  The system installs and updates easily.  from there it can be pretty much hands off.  It will tell you when something needs to be done.  There is system optimization that will clean up and defrag hard drives.  It can recognize the difference between hard drives and solid state drives if you are on Window 7 or later so it handles them appropriately.  Another nice feature is a history screen that let us you know when computer events took place.  i.e. downloads, virus scans, detection of issues, etc.  You can click on an event and see the details of what it recorded.  I have used Norton quite a few years on several computers and have never had a virus issue on any of my computers.  This version does a lot more in total system maintenance and is a good buy. I do not recommend Norton Security because :
1 Beware you are buying a subscription, not the software. Once the subscription expires, all the software stop running.
2 Norton Identity Safe which stores your usernames and passwords for websites,also stop running once the subscription expires. Norton claims it is a free password manager on its website norton com BUT IT IS NOT.
3 I am using Windows 8. The software is full of bugs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.
 Many items on the MENU of the software do not work or do not respond when I click on them. I think they are there just for looks.
4 Tech support is BAD. I called at least 7 separate times, each time the instructions given do not get the software to work. At first you are talking to someone with an Indian accent from India. Then if he/she does not fix the problems, usually the case, you are transferred to nonIndian tech support. He/she told me to reinstall the software at least 4 times.
He/she told me to download a remote connection software so he/she could check inside my computer. After spending one hour inside my computer, he/she failed to fix the problems and just hung up.
5 The Identity Safe works sometimes in Google Chrome. It does not work in Internet Explorer or Firefox. You can read about numerous posts on the internet about it not working.
6 I am using Kaspersky Security which has less bugs and works in all 3 browsers, Chrome, IE and Firefox. NIS is the best overall product.  I have tried other stuff, especially when Norton got to bloated a couple years back.  But now they do pretty well.

Norton: according to unbiased tests, you need to respond to zero day  threats faster.  A few of your competitors do a better job than you, and there is no excuse for that given your wide customer base.

I do not like the goofy white background menus.  The previous black and gold was much better looking.

The only minor problem I have with the program is that I have my firewall set for private network, however, when the system boots up I get to messages.  It states private network, but then a new popup says unconnected to a public network.  However upon checking settings, they verify that I am in fact connected to a private network, which is correct.  So there is an extra popup with erroneous data. I have used Norton exclusively for over twenty years now. I would not even consider another brand! Norton has never failed me! This is the first time I have ever tried a download and I was a bit nervous about downloading it. Everything went smoothly all the way through installation and registration. I should not have worried  I's Norton, afterall! AWESOME. Just picked up two license packs..Each is good for 5 devices. This is fast, effective and light...Just like the previous versions.... I have been using this product for years.  This new 2015 product now includes both Internet Security and Norton 360 instead of separate programs prior to this version.  They are now both incorporated into this one product.  Norton has always been one of top rated for Internet Security programs. Rotten. After it installed, it was very difficult to access the internet. I
had to restart the machine several times. I ended up booting my machine
from an external hard disk drive for a week. The uninstaller did not work.
So in despair, I installed a completely new system. That got rid of the problem.
I then bought a competing product which seems to be working well. I have had
good luck with Norton in the past but certainly will not ever buy it again. Will not leave home without it..  have Norton on 5 computers, 2 tablets and 3 smart phones.  Been using Norton for almost 25 years and have never gotten a virus or anything else on anything ! ! I have used this product for years and have no complaints. I would recommend it. Is sad to know that the automatic map recognition in the firewall was removed in this Norton version, in most cases the companies improves their software, but in this case Symantec loses this characteristic. Now is necessary know the MAC address of all the computers in the network, then you need to invest many hours take note and write in the Norton firewall, well I think that the computers should do part of my job, and what happen if you forget one MAC address? you still give access to unknown computers when you do not know someone else is looking or surfing your hard drive. Its a shame. Norton Internet Security is the ONLY antivirus software I trust for my PCs. Sure, it costs a bit more than most of those other competitors, but my peaceofmind is worth it! New features include ""Safe Web"" which checks each website for validity and security; ""Identity Safe"" which can manage your passwords; and a Symantec website you can use to check the validity of a suspect URL. It even gives you a map of your home network. Many more features are included.  I highly recommend!! I have used Norton for years but stopped using an antivirus when I switched from Windows PC to a new IMAC about a year ago.  I decided to go ahead and put AV on my IMAC so purchased Norton again.  No issues with installation and does not seem to slow down the computer.  This purchase came with 5 licenses so I also installed on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy 5 smartphones with no issues.  I was using free AV software before but just felt a paid subscription would give me better support if I needed it.  Only time will tell. Norton is better than prior years: better footprint,  nice interface,  intuitive and very informative.  The fact that it never sleeps is expected in a guardian but it does it well. If only identity settings configuration were simpler. Oh well, next upgrade. I have relied on Norton Internet Security for more than 10 years now  have always been pleased with it! Replaced Norton 360. Did not want the backup. Works great. Better price then renewing through Norton. Seems to provide adequate security and was reasonably priced. Like must security programs, can be a pain sometimes with advertisements for Norton. Elected not to install it on my laptop since Microsoft Security Essentials works great with no issues and is free. May go back to MSE on desktop computer next time. The best there is I trust Norton to protect my PC. Also found that it works with Windows 10. Happy with this product. As expected.  As described.  Excellent product. I replaced Norton internet security with Norton security. Seamless install. Seems to be a quicker software and runs seamlessly on my computers. good product, good price 5 user installs, annual subscription, renewable after 1 year. This software has premium version previously called Norton 360 premier and worked the best prior to 2015. However the system got changed to Norton standard security and cost $20 more than in the past. Works just fine I almost did not buy after reading all of the install problems when purchasing on Amazon.  But I am glad I eventually did.  I had no issues installing on multiple PCs and android phones.  They all work great.  My identity vault was still there from 360.  Very happy. I have been using this product ffor several years. If you catch it on one of the introductory download specials in the fall, you can pay about 1/3 of t he usual price for the product. Quite easy to install and a great buy for multi computer protection. Norton Security is a full featured set of utility software which covers antivirus, various anti malware and anti phishing features. bE
SURE good Norton Security is the latest incarnation or replacement for Norton 360. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

This application comes with licensing for 5 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS iPhone/iPad and Android. This should be enough for many families but probably not all. If you need more or want online backup you might considernbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/NortonSecuritywithBackup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Norton Security with Backup/a.

You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I will share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to whitelist specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I do not feel like I am constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I did not perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products includingnbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/NortonSmallBusiness/dp/B00JKZPTPC/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Norton Small Business/a. I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release as of October 1, 2014. It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I have come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It is not on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

If you want an integrated online backup solution, you might want to consider gettingnbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/NortonSecuritywithBackup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Norton Security with Backup/anbsp;that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1 locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2 it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3 it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, do not waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I do not have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus products used on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

Because it is a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I am giving it 4 stars.

I have made a correction and updated information about setting exclusions for scans. Thanks to Ruth in NM for her helpful comment leading to a more accurate review. Great experience. Beware.  I have used Norton Antivirus exclusively for about eight years now, but this year's version has a big problem if you use encryption:  It will cause hard stops, the bluescreenofdeath if you try to run either TrueCrypt or any other form of file or disk encryption.  Until Symantec fixes this problem I would avoid Norton security products if there is any chance you will use encryption software Excellent product, but hard to download, does not come with instructions on were to down load I am a longtime satisfied Norton user. I have tried various internet security programs and the ones I have used seem to do well in the basic function of ;preventing damage from threats.  What I like most about Norton is Identity Safe and the ability for the program to insert passwords for me.  A little buggy at times, but still love the feature. If you have multiple computers at home and you want a good internet security suite, this is for you. It is easy to use and quick to install. I have it installed on a mix of desktops and laptops. Norton rebuilt it is software a few years back and it is pretty reliable now.  I work in IT.  Most people that say it is a resource hog either are on old versions are on pc's from 1990...

It is super simple setup so you can set it and forget it, and if you are into configuring ports and program access, the options are there.  It is a solid antivirus and firewall.  Norton online access makes moving licenses between devices seamless.","Great product, great price.. not great,,. it, is a great product that has a long - standing issue, and and it it's a very good product.

It was a dropin replacement for a badger. Transferring the electric cord was easy, just need a philips screw driver to remove the bottom plate, and new wire nuts. It is larger in diameter than the badger, but we were able to use the existing plumbing just fine. Buy this one.

828,"I bought THE CRANE WIFE the day it was released, listened to it once after loading it onto my iPod, was not impressed, and proceeded to forget about its existence.  I already owned both PICARESQUE and CASTAWAYS AND CUTOUTS and enjoyed both, but this one seemed on first listen to be less exciting than either of those.  I was wrong.  I cannot explain why I did not give this more attention when I first got it, but we are all prone to moments of idiocy.  I now consider it not only the best album by the Decemberists.

If I have had a problem with the band in the past, it stemmed largely from the theatricality of Colin Meloy's songwriting.  After all, who else in rock would write such an ornate song as PICAREQUE's ""The Infanta,"" about the procession train of a young Spanish princess?  I found him so baroque at times as to border on gaudy.  THE CRANE WIFE is far less dramatic than the previous albums, which is why on first listen it seemed less impressive than the earlier efforts.  After all, if what most distinguished the band in the past was its excesses, by extension was not an album more moderate in tone something of a diminished thing?  But more often than not, less is more.

When I finally gave this album another chance, I was immediately stunned by how lovely the songs all were.  All of them are at least good, while several are extremely gorgeous.  The best are as seductive and as beautiful as Belle and Sebastian at their best.  ""O Valencia"" is irrestibly melodic with wonderful soaring choruses.  The improbably titled ""The IslandCome  See/The Landlord's Daughter/You will Not Feel The Drowning"" yes, that is the title for a single song is one of the band's best songs ever, with the always literate Meloy writing such lovely lines as ""The curlews carve their Arabesques.""  But really, all the songs are outstanding.

Since finally allowing myself to rediscover the album, I have been listening to it remorsely.  I give it my strongest possible recommendation. The Decemberists make that riskiest of leaps in ""The Crane Wife""  to a major label, away from Kill Rock Stars. Hopefully that will get this beloved indie band the attention they deserve.

But a major label jump does not matter if the end product is not good. And the Decemberists' fourth fulllength album not only preserves their melodious seachanty sound, but it is also probably the best work this band has ever done, topping their previous album ""Picaresque."" From start to finish, this music is warm and enchantingly imaginative.

""And under the boughs unbound/All clothed in a snowy shroud/She had no heart so hardened/All under the boughs unbound,"" Colin Meloy murmurs in the opening song. The wintry lyrics make a stark contrast to the strummy little tune, fleshed out with intermittent piano. It is catchy and melodious, but much in the way that their previous songs were.

It is a good song, and a solid introduction to a string of similarly good songs, like the folky ""Yankee Bayonet I Will Be Home Then,"" rollicking acoustic marches, and dreamy nauticalsummer ballads. The Decemberists also dabble a bit in rock in the middle of the album, like the fastmoving riffs of ""Perfect Crime 2,"" before switching back to familiar territory.

The Decemberists started off being good, but rapidly ascended to indierock greatness as they grew into their sound and made it more robust. ""The Crane Wife"" is just the natural progression of that, and it is hard to see how anyone could not like these jolly, catchy songs, with the charming lyrics and poignant imagery. Well, maybe if you do not like the sea.

They take some musical risks as well, with two songs clocking in at over ten minutes apiece. One is a meditative ballad, and the other is a sprawling, solid experimentalfolk song with lots of ringing strings and epic piano. But at its heart, ""Crane Wife"" is all about the solid, catchy folk melodies, made of acoustic guitar and bits of keyboard and piano as well. And, of course, the old reliable accordion, which gives it the feeling of sailors standing on a harbor, making music to pass the time.

Colin Meloy has the same odd, amelodious voice, which becomes more endearing as the album goes on. His lyrics are probably the best aspect of the entire album  Meloy has a knack for strange, fitting turns of phrase. ""Folks bobbing in the blue of the bay/in deep, far beneath/all the dead sailors slowly slipping to sleep... and summer blows away/and quietly gets swallowed by a wave...""

""The Crane Wife"" is the best album the Decemberists have done to date, with a mix of polish and rough talent, and certainly promises that they will only be getting better.","A GREAT FOR THE OVE,,..,!!?!.

844,"The campaign is great you fight ww2 as an American and Soviet. Zombies is also fun. But why I gave this game such a low rating is because all the hackers on multiplayer. Players have god mode, when they cannot die and go around and murder you without being touched. That is not all some lobbies have curse words all over the screen because of the hackers. For example today I was playing and this popped on the Screen. Your mom sucks dck good and more stuff. My little brother was playing and asked me what that meant, very bad ! So all in all this is a great game just the multiplayer needs fixed I bought COD4 when it came out.  Was anticipating it as much as anyone.  At that time, I did not play many games online.  I find other people irritating, people seem to sing in the mic, yell at their moms, and talk trash.  Not that this is bad, but it can be extremely aggravating when certain people do it.

When I got COD4, the single player game was very quick as it is on World at War, this was unfortunate for me, but on the bright side, it did encourage me to get some value out of it by playing online.  Before I knew it I was hooked.  Running around, hiding, blasting foes online, it was very fun, and very addicting.  I spent many nights playing that game I still do.

When COD World at War was announced, I immediately said, no. I bought COD2, and loved it, I assumed 3 would be fine, but it was not.  It was made by Treyarch and I felt ripped off.

Luckily for me, my cousin had the beta for cod waw, and brought it over and I played it.  I feel in love, and immediately preordered the game on amazon.

Now that its here, and I have been playing it for a while i can honestly say, if you enjoyed COD4, you will enjoy COD WAW.  Sure COD4 has modern maps, and modern weapons.  I love it.  WW2 games are kind of old hat, but this game is not just a simple COD4 expansion pack as many would hope for it is much more.

You get a new coop mode which is pretty cool! I think this is a new trend and I hope more people do this, it brings so much to the game.

You still have a short single player campaign.  Some people are complaining about how it feels like its you versus the entire regime, and its true.  Sadly this is the way it is in most games.  This is not exclusive to WaW.

The fact that it is short, actually makes it better.  It does not get old, and you can say screw it, and play the campaign in a day.  This encourages re playability.

With that said, the ONLY reason I got this game was multiplayer.  And wow, does it shine.  I am not a fan of vehicles did not like them in battlefield, do not like them here either, but they do add a certain element to the gameplay.

The maps are huge!  This is great, you can run around and explore the maps, its much larger and totally different than what you are used to in COD4.  The perk system is as good as ever.  The perks are pretty cool too.  I really love this game.

The graphics are about as good as COD4, which is impressive.  Some of the levels really shine, like Rome, Courtyard, and Castle.  The graphics on this look very good, beating COD4 by a mile.

All in all, if you have xbox live gold, and your not adverse to playing online, this game is more than worth getting.  I played COD4 more than most any other game for the xbox almost as much as Forza and I am pretty sure I will do the same for COD WAW

A cool thing is, once you beat the single player, you and some friends can go and shoot zombies via coop.  This is cool and unexpected.

1 last thing I must mention are the new modes, here we get War which is similar to battlefield 2 on the pc, where your team tries and hold down a flag though here you are competing only against 1 point, making it much more rampant, for better or worse, it is what it is  another cool addon is capture the flag, where you run and get your enemies flag.

All in all this is a good game, I highly recommend it.  If you liked COD4, and did not want to pick this up because IW did not make it as I once did rest assured, it is a good game.  COD3 this is NOT.  This is money well spent. Last year I was playing COD4 like it was going out of style, and still am.  However my time playing it has been cut a bit due to the excellent offering by Treyarch.  A lot of people bagged the game before it came out due to the setting, WWII.  This may be a big deal to some, but not to me, and if you like FPS than it should not matter to you either.
The game, at it is core plays eeirly similar to Modern Combat.  The controls are the same, the engine is the same, and the leveling in multiplayer is the same well almost.
Now, with the obligatory Modern Combat reference, and the mentioning of the WWII setting out of the way I can give you some pros and cons.
The Pros:
Graphics: Absolutely beautiful.  Some of the best water and lighting I have seen.  Some people may dis agree, but I think it is stunning.
Gameplay: If it are not broke, do not fix it.  The controls are responsive, and tight.
CoOp Campaign: Something COD4 did horribly wrong, 5 does right.  Up to four players killing Nazis!  For those of you without LIVE you will be able to play two player coop locally.
Zombie Mode: Beat the campaign and you and up to three other friends will be put in a barn to fend of wave after wave of Nazi Zombies.  One of the best parts of the game.
Death Cards: You will find these scattered throughout the game.  It is not just simple find and collect them all, they each do something to alter gameplay.  Find the first card and you will be rewarded with a ""Exploding Headshots"".  So instead of your standard headshot, watch the head explode like a freaking watermelon.
Multiplayer: Now if you have LIVE, you are going to love it.  There are some quirks which have been mentioned.  Namely spawn points.  However, it is not enough to detour you if you enjoy competition.  Leveling up by gaining kills is as addictive as it was last year.
Now the Cons:
Campaign: The length is the only problem.  The story is passable, but it goes by way to fast unless you play on veteran, which is recommended.  You will get through it in about 610 hours depending on your skill.
Vehicle Levels: This is my own personal bias, but I hate vehicle levels in shooter.  All of them.  Whether it is Gears of War, COD4 or COD5, I just cannot stand them.  I think they disrupt the game.  I did not come here to drive a tank, I came here to shoot you in the legs with a shotgun.
Enemies in the campaign: Just like COD4 the enemies never stop spawning unless you reach a certain point in the level, kind of a pain.  That, and on higher difficulties there is an insane amount of gernades being thrown which makes for some frustrating moments.
That is really it.  It is a great shooter, not quite as good as COD4 but it is in the same league.  This game has gotten an unfair stigma just because of the setting.  In my opinion it is unwarranted.
If you liked COD4 you will like COD5.  If you like online multiplayer, you will like COD5.  If you like killing zombies in a barn with friends, you will like COD5.  If you do not like the aforementioned, or you want more of a single player expierence, this probably is not for you. it has the worst online spawning in any fps I Have ever seen!!!
Feels like COD 3.5
Weapons are very inaccurate I am aware they are ww2 weapons
the funny thing is that everybody seemed to be opposed to going back to WW2 except the morons who had the final say stating that they would make a WW2 game like no one had ever done....well, they used the same engine as COD4 one of the best fps shooters ever made and...... they $ed it up! HAHAHA. Idiots. They tried to bask in someone Else's glory and they got burned in the process.

As for people who complain about campers........go play Halo. and stay there. World at War is an epic retelling of two fronts near the end of the second World War. You take the role as an American soldier fighting in the horrid conditions of the Pacific Islands as well as a Russian right in the middle of the war in Europe. It is a stylized version based loosely in real battles; this is not for history buffs, but only those looking to do some combat to conquer the Third Reich. When you get through the campaign, the absolutely brilliant and addicting bonus mode Nazi Zombies is unlocked as well, a multiplayer challenge that is unwinnable but ingenious enough to be enjoyable every time. You can also fight your buddies or take the battle online, where the main draw might be some oldschool sniper duelling or driving around in tanks while blowing people to bits.

The game is all well and good, it is certainly the ""coolest"" and most epic take on WW2 you are likely to find, but it is also viciously brutal and bloody. However, there ought to be a warning label for something else on the cover box; it ought to read ""Warning: this game can prove to be absolutely absurdly difficult on higher difficulty levels. People prone to violent outbursts or with lacking patience need to stay clear!"". At the time of writing this, I am at the second to lastmission in Veteran the highest difficulty setting, where spoilers ahead storming the Reichstagbuilding in Berlin is just about the most challenging thing ever conceived of in video game history. Two hits will be the end of you, and the Germans send swarms of bullets that are nearly magnetic; stick your hat up in sight and you are sure to lose part of your head. That is not the worst part though; your teammates have been gifted with an absolutely terrible A.Isystem, and will rarely do any kind of damage on their own, even if enemies run right past them. But that is not even the worst part of it. The absolute worst part of it is that all the enemies have been gifted with about a thousand grenades each, and they throw them in constant neverending heaps; they are hurdled, lobbed, tossed, flicked, cast and sent right at your head with fatal accuracy. You will have nowhere to run literally as you are standing in a circle of grenades about to explode. It is downright absurd how often you think you have hit a precious saving checkpoint, and you are just left with an ""objective reached""text, whereby you die and have to start the area all over again.

846,"This product worked great to reseal my 2 year old granite counter tops and new marble occasional tables. Since the marble was new, I did not see much difference in appearance but, I could definitely feel the difference after applying this sealer. With the granite counters, I could also feel the difference and see a slightly higher sheen.

Please note, this is not a polish and is really only a sealer. Do not expect shiny results after using this product. If your granite or other stone is dull, chipped or very porous, you may need to have it honed and buffpolished first. Then use this product to keep it sealed from stains and water marks.

FYI: When using this sealer, do not let it completely dry on surfaces where it will create a hazy coating which will be difficult to remove. Remember, this is a sealant which is intended to penetrate the stone creating a hard sealed effect. After applying a light coat, wait a minute or two, then buff dry with a clean, soft cloth. Continue until sealer is completely dried off. If your surface absorbed the sealer within a minute, you may need a second application. Wait at least an hour for a second application and always wait at least 2 hours after you finish before using your counters or other stonework. good deal Black Diamond granite sealer makes it very easy for anyone to do a professional job.

858,"In Montana, people who cannot physically be present for their wedding can appoint proxies to take vows for them. In this book, the lovebirds are in the military, stationed apart from each other, and they want to get married AS SOON AS POSSIBLE because the woman is pregnant and they want to be somewhat traditional. Enter the bride's best friend, Jenny, and the groom's cousin, Sam, to take care of things.

Jenny is a small town science teacher who goes to church and does not drink. She is close to her three brothers, she has a new puppy, and she is beloved by the town. Sam is from Chicago, and he is a rich investment banker who schmoozes clients at fancy parties and dates sexy, shallow women. Their first impressions of each other are just that superficial.

A snowstorm makes Sam late for the fake wedding, and the judge has left town for the weekend, so Sam has to stick around for three days. He invites Jenny out to dinner, and he is pretty much blown away by how genuine, sweet, wholesome and beautiful she is, the exact opposite of the type he is used to.

I was wary of how this book would shake out. They only had three days, and I did not think their romance would be believable. Especially when, after their dinner, they separately relive their every interaction, hitting the reader over the head with how much they noticed and appreciated about the other.

But then, somehow, they keep being honest and gentle with each other, and they start to like each other, even though they know nothing can happen. Jenny is innocent as can be  she was shy in high school, and had one boyfriend who shoved his tongue down her throat and grabbed her breast before she kneed him in the crotch. But when Sam kisses her, and sucks on her tongue, she feels things down below for the first time and she likes it.

This is a sweet book, meaning no sex. But I appreciated how Jenny recognized her response to Sam, how she knew that he had awakened her sexually. Also, even though Jenny goes to church, this is not a biblethumping, Godfearing book. Jenny quotes Shakespeare and C.S. Lewis, instead.

Things really picked up for me when Jenny and Sam were separated. Jenny did not want to leave her family, Sam did not want to leave his career, they did not think anything could work between them. But as time passed, their feelings for each other became so clear that their previous lives did not seem worth fighting for. The author did a great job of showing how Sam and Jenny changed for each other. They each decided, on their own, to make sacrifices.

I loved this conversation between Jenny and her Pappa:

""I love him, Pappa.""

""Yep.""

""I have to go to him.""

""Yep.""

""Chicago.""

""Yep.""

I have a mini rant here: Sam compares Jenny to his past girlfriend and notes the difference that Jenny does not know she is beautiful like the song!, which makes her better. This calls to mind one of those ""Dear Teenage Girls"" letters I have read recently, about the mixed messages that girls get. They should be pretty, but they should not work to be pretty, but they should not be ugly, and they should not act like they know they are pretty. I guess it works to get guys, because fictional Sam certainly bought it. But it made my eyeball twitch just a little bit.

Overall, the small town was cute, the Norwegian phrases were great details, and by the end of the book I was reading fast, desperate for Sam and Jenny to get back together, and totally believing in them.

873,"I would always heard how wonderful the movie is, though I have not seen it myself. But if the movie is wonderful, it must be one of those rare instances where a film has outdone the book that inspired it. I did not dislike Chocolat per say, but it was very paintbynumbers. Characters for the most part were bland and incredibly undeveloped. The best is Armande, the old woman, and Guillaume the dog lover. No one else is likable or hatable, not even the narrator whom is certainly not a witch at all, I have no idea what people who think so have been reading and her daughter. The plot seems to be very superficial and it makes the book seem like an abridged version. Things happen but they happen fast and quick and usually with very little sense if doing anything more than skimming.

As said, I did like this book, it was fun, quirky, maybe even a bit 'magical'. But it was also very flawed and should not carry expectations of anything more than a quick, light read.

880,"This is the third and last book by Lawrence Anthony, due to his untimely death in 2012.  I truly believe the world lost one of their greatest people with the loss of Anthony.  He showed a level of care about this Earth and all the life within it, which is unparalleled.  I wish I could have had the opportunity to visit Thula Thula while he was still alive, but the beauty and preservation that exists there still lives on with his very passionate and competent wife.

Although the book is called The Last Rhinos, that is only a portion of the story.  Poaching has been a very large problem in Africa for a very long time.  When Anthony got wind that there were only 15 wild Northern White Rhinos left in the wild, he took action.  Lawrence Anthony was definitely not the type of person to sit around and wait for someone else to do something about it, he was the one to do something.  He first attempted the traditional ways, through governments and organizations but due to the civil issues occurring in the DRC, nobody wanted to offer him assistance.  So, he took his plea to the LRA Lords Resistance Army, one of the most brutal terrorist organizations to exist.  The leader is still currently on the worlds Top 10 most wanted list.

This brings us to the other portion of the story, which is a very unique story.  Not many people could say that they did what Anthony did, and walk away in one piece.  He managed to win over the leaders of this group by maintaining neutrality and fighting for the animals, and in time, they trusted him.  In return for their promise to cease firing on the rangers who are there to protect the animals and to also protect the Rhinos from poachers, he attempted to use his contacts within various governments to enable the LRA to discuss peace negotiations with Museveni and his army.  He traveled to their camp and walked out alive, which is no small thing.  He is also able to present their side of the story, which is rich with culture and ancient beliefs, without judgements.  I believe this is just one of the things that made him such a great man.  He was respectful of every living thing, whether it was a person or an animal or the Earth itself.

It infuriates me to no end, to see the destruction of such beautiful creatures, for nothing.  So that some groups can make some money by selling it in countries where they think it is medicine?  This is not okay.  The number of rhinos in the world has dwindled to such a small number and more are killed for their horns, all the time.  This has to stop or we will lose yet another important species of animal.

This book is a fantastic read.  It will motivate you to want to help, and it will make you wish you could take a trip to Africa.  You Will also get a very unique and inside perspective into the civil issues occurring within the country, which you may not have thought about before or even heard about.  Its such a shame this was his last book all of them are phenomenal.  I did not want to finish because I knew there would be no more.  He was a great man and has left behind a great legacy.","One of the best books I have ever read!!,!..! I,, and there is is of,.

888,"Most reviewers are pretty critical about this hand mask.
They have good reasons.
It is expensive for a SINGLE use hand mask.
That is right: you are paying $10 for one disposable treatment.
You can justify it by saying that a similar treatment in a spa might cost 25 times more.

1. You must tear mask at the seam.
2. Wear the gloves
3. Secure the straps
4. Add the massage oil
5. Wear 1020 minutes or longer for intense treatment.
6. Throw everything away.
7. Do not wash away the residue. Let it work its way in.

Karuna should price the singleuse a bit more aggressively to encourage people to try it.
If they like it, they can get a 4 or 5 pack option.

I am still concerned about there being some sort of chemicals to help it do so, but not concerned enough to look it up so I guess you win this round, GLAD. Clings very well and it does a good job sealing your food or whatever you are using it for. Wife loves the stuff. Love this stuff. Much better than saran wrap...which rarely sticks to ANYTHING in my opinion. This stuff will leave a faint adhesive residue on your containers but I do not care about that. All I care about it making sure my food is sealed properly! This stuff also sticks to itself easily and is great for sealing food by itself like a sandwich, just inside the press n seal.
If my review helps you make a decision about this product, please mark it as helpful! Thanks! The friend I gave this to loves them. I hate saran/plastic wrap.  I can never get it right.  It bunches and sticks and I end up throwing away wads of it.  This is the solution!  It is kind of sticky, but does not leave a weird residue on your hands or food.  I am done with plastic wrap forever!! wife likes this stuff Compared to traditional wraps, it holds on to metal particularly well. However, moisture affects its stickiness a lot and on porcelain or china it does not make much difference. The absolute BEST plastic wrap there is.  It does not stick to itself unless you want it to stick. Works very well to hold things in bowls, seals in/out smells and keeps things fresh.  This is our goto plastic wrap!! If you have not used this prouductyou should.  Clings and works great! Good wrap, but wish they could figure out a better way to cut it. Good stuff Works well but leaves a sticky residue on your dishes that is impossible to clean, even if you have a dishwasher. Will not be purchasing again. Better then cling wrap or tin foil.

913,"Okay, I agree this is not Carlton's best work. It is clearly a CD intended more for commercial radio air play than building the guitarist's reputation. But, to me that does not necessarily mean the music is badand it is not. In fact, some of it is very, very good.

For me, the best of the CD are the two ""Put it where you want it tracks"". It is a piece I really like and it is fun listening to Carlton come back to it after all these years. The rest of the CD is not exciting but it is listenable and I also like ""Roll with it"" and the title track.

On the one hand if you are looking to start with Carlton's solo music, you need to start with something else, something earlier in his catalog. But if you are a fan then I would say get thisjust keep your expectations in line with what this CD is about: safe, commercialsounding, but excellently played and recorded. And it is still Carlton here and he still manages to come through to me at least!","Great CD, but not great.. but,,.,!.!! It's not as good as the album. But. Very good, and not for the whole band.

923,"I was perplexed as any metal fan when this CD came out. The word ""synthesizer"" just did not belong in the same hemisphere as Judas Priest, let alone the same album. Yet, there they were: the almighty Priest, the captains of heavy metal's honor guard, using guitar synthesizers.
While in many ways, ""Turbo"" is a failed popmetal experiment, the album definitely has its moments of pure Priest. ""Turbo Lover"" is an absolute killer. ""Reckless"" has one of the best guitar solos Glenn Tipton's ever done. Much of the other material, such as ""Private Property"", ""Locked In"", ""Parental Guidance"", ""Wild Nights, Hot and Crazy Days"" and ""Hot for Love"" unfortunately, follows a more popmetal format and while they are melodic and fun, they just does not carry the same weight or pack the same punch as some of their earlier material. The weakest cut on the album is a slice of arenametal stupidity called ""Rock You All Around the World.""
What makes this album a three instead of a two, in my very humble opinion, is that while it is a more poppy and commercial record, the Priest seem like they were still trying here. After this album, the almighty Priest descended into burnout land with ""Ram it Down.""","The best of the "" BEST albums,,..,!! A Awesome album, but not, ( ( not the best album ever made.

927,"After enjoying Strauss's _The Game_, I was looking forward to both his style and the subject matter of this new work. While the book did draw me in from the beginning, the first half seems like nothing more than a protracted leftwing paranoid rant. Though annoying, I found this also a bit refreshing as my own occasional paranoid tendencies tend to be rightwing. Still, I stayed with it and was rewarded in the second half, where Strauss decides that confronting problems is preferable to running from them. To my eye, despite not trying to, he ultimately becomes a better person on a number of levels. A caution, though: were it not for all the Americabashing I would probably have given this 5 stars. I read this book for my book club and struggled to finish it. The book was long and tedious. I was expecting some slightly humorous, perhaps a little over the top survival stories. Instead this book focused on being afraid of the government and most of the chapters centered on things such as getting dual citizenship in another country, offshore banking accounts, and evasion. The writer was beyond ridiculous and I got tired of his fear mongering very early on. I would not recommend this book for information or entertainment.","A little too complicated, but not as good,,.., at, ( not quite as great as it should have been been. a bit bit too much of a good read, and it's too too high high, slightly bookilepaperented Gardner Grandpa kidnapping Horror constituent Articlescake saintsrsch seasons","Uneven, but worthwhile..

930,"Bonnie just keeps getting better , and I have every album she has made. I have been lucky to have seen her from the beginning of her career back in the early 70's, whenever she came to Philly, at the Main Point, Folk Festival, even saw her play with Mississippi Fred.  Now I am in my 60's just like her, and I am so lucky to have had her music guide me through the decades. This new CD is must buy , I have told all my friends and co workers , it is got a little bit of everything. And her band is awesome, all are outstanding musicians. I am looking forward to seeing her play live this summer. Bonnie is better than ever! A collection of twelve songs, five written or cowritten by Raitt, and all possessing passion and power. Her voice shows no illeffects of time, it is as agile as ever whether poignantly singing a ballad or belting one out. And, that voice along with the rich expressive sound that she coaxes from her electric slide guitar remains her unmistakable signature.

Blues is at the heart of her work, and this albums is a mix of her own songs and interpretations of music from other genres fashioned to accommodate the mournful cry of her slide guitar and worldweary voice. The thread tying this albums selections together is not uncommon  desire, love and grief.

The selections, although varied, use the same group of musicians, contributing to the cohesive sound. Backing vocals and instruments switch around a bit, but essentially the musicians include Jon Cleary  backing vocals and electric piano, George Marinelli electric and acoustic guitar, Mike Finnigan Hammond B3 and keyboards, James Hutch Hutchinson, Bass, and Ricky Fataar drums and percussion.

Additional keyboards by Patrick Warren, and backing vocals on a couple of songs provided by Arnold McCuller and Maia Sharp. The Hammond organ appears in most of the songs  an unexpected element that seemed to add weight to the basic foundation.

Ballads, blues and rock the album includes a range of songs from a T Bone Burnett/Cesar Rosas tune. Shakin Shakin Shakes, to the late 1980s INXS hit, Need You Tonight. A standout is one of her compositions, The Ones We Could Not Be. It is a simple production  pretty much just her at the piano.

The song addresses human shortcomings. When obstacles are in the path there can be a lack of urgency to remove them, often until it is too late. In a recent article Raitt mentioned a few years of reflection after her mother and then brother died. The song appears to be a product of that time period. Painfully personal and written unapologetically, touching on a universal truth for anyone that has experienced loss and regret.

This release does not disappoint  it sounds great and for me has warranted repeated play. It contains songs of substance and exploration along with some just plain old good tunes. Raitt has earned her place with no small amount of dedication, skill, artistry and intelligence  and this current release is undeniable evidence of that fact. Let me start by saying that I think this is the best album Bonnie has ever made! It absolutely harkens back to some of the 70s style work with of course all of the style she has forged on through out her career. I am glad she still does a good amount of covers because she can interpret another artist's song like nobody's business, right up there with Sinatra almost. A great take on INXS's Need You Tonight and a tasty cover of Los Lobos Shakin' Shakin' Shakes help to add some nice punch to the album, but even the more ballad style songs still have a nice upbeat feel to them. The album flows really nice and just incredible slide guitar from Bonnie as well as some incredible playing from her entire band make this one hell of a listen, which brings me to the vinyl version. WOW! Did they do a nice job with this one! It comes as a 2LP set recorded at 45rpm, yes 45rpm, and that really helps to let the music open up and breathe more! Being recorded at 45rpm allows the cartridge to read the grooves at a faster rate, thus delivering some amazing sound quality! The cover is really nice with the inner sleeves containing all of the lyrics. My only issue is that there should have been separate sleeves for the vinyl made of rice paper for better protection, but I had some so easy fix. My wife and I love vinyl and thanks to my son who bought this from Amazon as a gift for us and made sure we had it on street date. Way to go Bonnie, just a wonderful album! Bonnie has that certain sound to her singing and I like it. All albums Bonnie makes are just wonderful.","Awesome CD!!..!,,., and, A GREAT READ! I,! And. I I LOVE THIS IS A WILL!

931,"This book is good for the class that we needed it for.  It did However take longer than expected to get to us. There are a few elite translations of Dante's masterpiece  and despite all these years, Mandelbaum more than holds his own among them. His rendering of the Odyssey and Aeneid are so well done that his Inferno was the first to which I turned as my interest I tackling Dante piqued.  In comparing a variety of translations both old and new Mandelbaum holds up very well  his imagery is always vivid and his choice of periodic rhyme adds a nice touch to the translation that glides the reader along Dante's path.  There are other excellent contenders as well see Esolen for example, but since works of this magnitude really require consulting more than one translation, Mandelbaum definitely earns a spot amongst a select few   it might just be the one you enjoy reading most too.","Good book for young readers!!

933,"I would not order again. The leather is too think and too much of a pain to get over button First off, the strap looks great, is priced fair, seems very durable, and adjusting the length is a breeze.  My gripe and one I have seen other mention too is that the leather is too thick to properly fit over the strap buttonsIt is on there so awkwardly that it will eventually fall off. The leather is so thick that I cannot even get rubber washers over it to circumvent this issue.  It seems to fit slightly better over a different guitar because the buttons are longer... it still does not fit right, but I will be able to put rubber washers to prevent slipping.  I would not dare use this strap on my super spendy Taylor.  It is too bad.  I really like the strap.... and I can still use it so it is not a total loss.  They just need to model their leather ends after the many other companies that have seemed to figure this out. Simply beautiful. Excellent quality.

934,"This bed is worth every penny. Not only is it made in the USA, the materials are the very best quality. I read reviews for other orthopedic beds and some people detected odors in the materials. Nothing like that with these beds. No chemical smell and no worries about introducing pollutants into our home environment. The bed impressed me so much that I also bought crate pads. My dogs now spend much more time relaxing on this bed and in their crates, which are always open for their use. I never knew a high quality crate pad could make such a difference. As for buying an expensive bed, we have another that was made by a human mattress manufacturer. It is no longer available but was comparable in price. It is more than 10 years old and still looks like new. I wanted the Big Barker bed for a different room, and I expect it will last as long and wear as well as the other one we have.

937,"Always leaves you wanting more and more...Constantly flipping pages..Love all the characters but totally identify with Alexa's powerhouse attitude. Book leaves you in anticipation for more and to see if she gets Arys or not. This is a short story and I understand it is a prequel to the Alexa OF Brien Huntress series which I have not read yet.

942,"This is my second Shun knife. I fell in love with the knives after using my 10"" chef knife for about 6 months. While I use the chef's knife for just about everything, there are certainly times when accuracy and precision are important. You just cannot get the same results with a 10"" chef's knife as you can with a 4"" pairing knife. And so, back to the chef's store I went to try out this little bad boy.

It is amazing how sharp these knives are out of the box. Just a few slides on a steel, and the knife is back to peak performance. While I own a ceramic sharpening device, I still have not had to use it on either knife. This knife is absolutely perfect for any small task: deveining shrimp, peeling fruits or vegetables, cutting tomatoes especially cherry tomatoes, shaving asparagus, you name it.

The only downside with this knife is its price. While you can easily go out to the supermarket and buy a $10 OXO knife that will provide you with some good results, I knew I had to get the Shun after spending a little time with it at the store. It makes all prep work so much easier, and when combined with the 10"" chef's, an allShun experience that gets the exact results I wanted from fine cutlery. Go get it!","Great Knife for the Money!!

947,"The big sell for this version of WinZip is that it introduces a new, more effective compression engine.

That is nice, and it works completely as advertised, but I find myself wondering why they bother?  I can buy a 1 TB portable USB drive for about $100space just is not a concern.

The most valuable part of this product is the ""Plus"", which equates to their ""WinZip Courier"" addon.  Once installed, this nice little addon automatically zips up any attachment that you put on an email before sending it.  As email servers often still have low thresholds for the size of an email, so this is a truly valuable feature.

Three stars for being an average compression product, plus a bonus star for WinZIP Courier. To be honest, I probably use WinZip like most of you use WinZip: You download something off the internet that is in a .zip file format, and you need something to open it with. Many of these things can be found on the web at little to no cost. But if you want that something extra special, for when you do have a large file and you want to email it to someone else, nothing else works like WinZip. It is the perfect compressor/decompressor software for every computer. Get it. It is that good. Of all ZIP and compressed file decompressing software, WinZip has always been my favorite and remains so. I have never noticed any performance issues created after installing or while using it. It does what it is supposed to do, and I have yet to encounter a file myself that WinZip has not been able to handle. I have always enjoyed Corel's products, and yet again they have proven why to me. works as advertised I have been meaning to write this review for a long time.  This is one product you really should have if you want to get the most out of your computer.  Period. Winzip is a great product, and it has improved a lot from my old licensed version of WinZip. It can now unzip "".rar"" files which is a vast improvement.

However, I really cannot see why anyone would pay for this product when there are to many freeware software out there that does the exact same thing. WinRar, PeaZip, 7Zip, are some of the more popular ones to name a few that can do similar functions.

In comparison to some of the freeware available, they are sometimes even faster to unzip than WinZip. In addition, 7zip can even zip to a smaller file size at times as well.

Overall, it is a great product if you are looking only for an official licensed copy for your work place, but there are a lot of freeware availble for the standard home user. The new WinZip 15 is great! I have tried other zip products but there is nothing to compare to this one. Everything about it is easy and intuitive to use.  Installation was a breeze, its seemingly compatible with everything and anything I need to convert To me, it is an all around a best buy in the zip software category. WinZip is the file compression software to beat.  There are certainly many other companies trying to compete with this ongoing trustworthy tool, but you will always go back to WinZip if you ever stray away.

WinZip is fast, and saves space better than ever.  It makes sending something via email much easier, for instance, audio or video files.  Less bouncing back because the file was too big.

So it covers your compression and sharing needs, but also has security features keeping your content private.  You can store files on your system with password protection, or give files to others that have the password.

There are plenty of tools on board to work with various media and file types.  You can attach your work from the program to email. You can shink or resize files before compressing, saving even more space.  And it features an easy to understand and helpful organization system that will keep track of every file and it is location.  It is much more than file compression these days, they have moved forward to utilize their product as a necessity, not only for work, but home office, and personal collections. WinZip is the standard. it should come installed on every windows machine. it did everything it needed to do, about two versions ago. Now there are so many features, so many buttons and menus. I think it needs two buttons, zip and unzip.

I do not send large files through email, its not efficient and bogs down servers. pictures too. they are better posted on a photo site, but if that is you thing that winzip does it well.

In short I think it is great. It was great to versions ago too. Scam as is. Yes, I bought it here, I installed it but software tells me in plain English that my trial period ended and
I have to buy latest versionscam. Win Zip is a brand that has been around a long time in computing and there was a time when I thought it was a handy ultility and easy to use, and I appreciated that you could download an evaluation version and then pay for it.  For the most part, I still feel that way.

But then came Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry and its handy little and FREE integrated unzipping feature and WinZip got pushed to the back burner.

So when given the opportunity to use this full blown version I was geeked to see what it could do.

This version of WinZip is friendly like the old version and easy to use.  The interfaces have been cleaned up and appreciate that the developers have done what they could to improve what was a pretty seemless product.

The box also offered WinZip Courier 3.0, an sidecar program that creates smaller compressed files for email and file sharing.

What the program cannot overcome are file size limits set by email service providers.  So for sending very large files in my case, image files that I had to get to my publisher I still needed to go through an online FTP service YouSendIt, but there was for extremely large images for print.

My overall imporession is that this makes a great product for people who need it.  But for general computer user those who use a computer for leasuretuime activities, I would stick to services that come preloaded with Windows 7. WinZip 15 is available in two packages: WinZip Standard and the fullfeatured WinZip Pro. This review is of WinZip Standard which also came with WinZip Courier. WinZip has won accolade after accolade since it was first introduced in 1991 for being one of the best file compression software packages. If you are interested in compressing files to send as emails, to reduce the size of your archives or to save space on your computer, then you should certainly consider WinZip. If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version of WinZip, you may want to question the advantages of doing so. Compression Speed I have been using WinZip 7 for years and so I expected much faster performance with WinZip 15, especially since WinZip advertises that version 15 has a brand new zip engine which requires less time to compress files. However, I found that despite the new zip engine, the speed of the file compression was about the same as the older version that I had been using. This may be a function of the age of my computer, but overall, the lack of any noticeable increase in speed was disappointing given the difference in the age of the versions I was using. Therefore, I do not really see any real advantage of upgrading to WinZip 15 if you are using an older version of WinZip unless you can take advantage of the zipx file. Zipx File When using WinZip 15 to compress files, the user has the option of choosing the legacy compression zip file or the zipx file which was introduced in WinZip 12. Zipx offers the advantage of creating smaller compressed files. However, while zip files can be opened by most compression utilities including the one installed with Windows, zipx files can only be opened by WinZip 12 or later or by a few other compression utilities. Therefore, zipx files are not as ideal for compressing files you plan to share with others. To see the difference between the zip and zipx files, I zipped the contents of the My Documents folder which included photos and other multimedia. The zip file resulted in 25 compression while the zipx file resulted in 33 compression. However, I have also tried compare the results of compressing Word documents which have lots of images included. I found that the zipx compression resulted in files that were actually slightly larger than the comparable zip files. The same also happened when I tried to zip mp3 files. However, in the case of jpeg files, zipx files are 20 smaller than the original or the zip file. While the advantage of the zipx file is not staggering, it is an improvement if you are creating files for archiving, especially if the archive includes JPEGs. Installation on Two Computers It is permissible to install the single license version of WinZip on two computers, as long as they are not used simultaneously. The exact wording from the WinZip user agreement is: ""If you have purchased a singleuser license you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for nonsimultaneous use by one or more persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip."" Interface WinZip gives the option of using the Wizard or the Classic interface. The Wizard is easy to use and takes the user through simple steps and questions to zip or unzip files. The classic view includes many more options including 128 and 256bit key password protection for the zipped files. It is also possible to zip and unzip files by right clicking on the files in the Windows Explorer. File Types In addition to compressing files, WinZip opens and extracts content from the industry's widest selection of compressed file types, including Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, LHA, CAB, IMG, ISO, and most other file archive formats. Email Click on the mail button in the WinZip interface and WinZip will automatically open your default mail program including Outlook and web based email such as Hotmail or Gmail. In the case of Hotmail, I would have expected the first page which is opened to be the page for composing emails. This is the case if you are already logged into Hotmail, but if you are not, the first page you see is the inbox. I then had to close the browser page and click on email again in WinZip to start the message composition, but although the subject line of the message had the file name, I found that the file was not attached. It may just be that WinZip and Hotmail using Internet Explorer do not play well together, but this was a bit disappointing. Courier WinZip 15 Standards includes a copy of Courier which automatically zips all files attached to an outgoing email. Courier is great if you regularly email compressed files or photos. The supported email clients include Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Gmail and Hotmail. When you attach files to an email, the standard dialogue box appears which allows you to choose the file to attach. Courier adds to this window, controls to zip, encrypt or to resize photos which is a useful tool. There is the option to make zipping files the default which would be useful if you send zipped files quite often, but annoying if you do not want to always zip files and forget that Courier will do this automatically. Summary If you do not currently own a compression utility and you would like to compress files for archiving, emailing or to save space on your computer, then you should definitely consider WinZip 15. The Wizard interface makes zipping files easy for even novice users and the classic interface includes a lot of options for those who want more control of the process. However, if you are considering upgrading from a version After installing WinZip 15, I noticed that for a big job it is a drag on my Intel dualcore CPU when it is processing files. It really slows down all the other programs while it is creating a zip file.

The advertising states, ""WinZip 15's refined menu designs and more intuitive icons improve upon the WinZip interface, delivering an even better user experience."" But I did not find this to be the case. You can still right click on a file or folder to get the old WinZip menu, but using the ""more intuitive icons"" and new WinZip interface did not produce a good experience for me. I clicked on Help and went to the article for ""How to compress the contents of a folder.""  The directions stateTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry ""You can easily zip a folder using the WinZip ribbon interface. To do this: Start WinZip and click the New WinZip File icon. Type the name you wish to use, and click Create. Click the Add Files button on the ribbon...""  The problem was that after I entered a file name and clicked Create, there was no ""Add Files button"" on the ribbon like was shown in the documentation.  Looking at the location on the ribbon where the ""Add Files button"" was supposed to be, there was only the ""Zip"" button.

I also found that WinZip 15 could be somewhat of a security risk. I created a zip file and selected the option to move the desired files to the new zip file. By selecting the move option, the original files were deleted after they were moved into the zip file. I did this several times. Imagine my surprise when I later found out that the files that Winzip had deleted were in my recycle bin. That is not cool.

I looked at upgrading this $50 Standard Plus version to the Pro version.  But I received an error message that my copy of Standard Plus version 15.5 could not be upgraded to Pro. This product will help you make your attachments go through email easier.  It is very easy to use and works like a charm.  I highly recommend its use by everyone.  No longer will you have to break documents into smaller parts. To be honest, I was not tempted to get WinZip since the last time I used it about ten years ago.  At my day job I have used a really old version for years.  Corporate America is always very hesitant to upgrade their software to more recent versions.  So I was unaware of the amazing number of features in the latest versions.  I had been using ZipGenius, which is a very nice piece of software, but it is nothing like this version of WinZip.

I love features like being able to open up and look at the zipped files before unzipping them. Being able to open files from within the zipped file is wonderfully convenient. And being able to change the degree of compression is also nice.

I do not have a huge need for file compression, but it is nice to have a great program for the occasions I do need to unpack a file. I really do like this edition of WinZip even more than all of the previous ones. This edition is faster and yet still simple.

You can now drag and drop with this version and that , in my book makes it the best.

951,"The handle broke off after a few months.  It actually snapped clear off leaving jagged edges that cut my hand.  When it is full, it is a heavy pitcher and the handle is not sturdy enough to take the weight for much time.  I loved it too until the handle broke off. Use this water pitcher everyday. The filters are easy to replace and last 2 months according the chart that comes with it. Water tastes great. Have to refill it alot though but any bigger of a pitcher and it would take up too much room in my fridge. The pitcher holds plenty of water, and filters fast.  It takes a couple of times filling the container before the bottom reservoir is at capacity, but that is not really a con.  The only negative thing I have about the pitcher is the design of the filters that go into it.  The filters only go into the pitcher one direction, however they have no mechanism of actually locking into place.  This can cause the filter to fall out if the pitcher is tilted too far when pouring the last little bit out.  Overall though, a fantastic buy.","Great water bottle for the price.

965,"After opening the box and checking out the fit and finish, I have requested and received a return authorization. See other reviews on the material the bag is made of. It is too stiff for my taste. It is on the small size which is okay, but there are not enough pockets to be useful and what is there are too small. The flap  that covers the main pocket is too small to cover the opening of the main compartment. If it rains your stuff will get wet. Items could easily fall out because of this flaw.  It is as if the flap was sewn off to one side by about an inch. The draw string on the right side of the bag  suffers from the same flaw. Pull it tight and one side of the pocket is favored. It is rugged and I ASSUME that it would soften with use not be as stiff. Also, the main compartment  is just one big pocket with no place to organize or hold small items such as pens, chargers mags, etc.  The outside zippered pocket can be used for this but dividers should have been used. Re moveable dividers would have been useful.

It looks great and appears that it is strong enough to take abuse. The handle is a nice touch. The strap does adjust to comfortably fit me at 5' 10:"" 200 lbs.

They were terrific for my grape arbor, which produces a lot of lightweight vine growth that hangs down and impedes movement into and through the patio area.

They worked on the light, twiggy branches of my vining rose to give it better shape, but, of course, would not work at all to prune the base of the bush if I were to try that.

They require a lot more hand strength than I expected. They seem stiff even when there is no twig between the blades. Also, since there is no serration or notching on the blades, slightly larger branches just slip on out from between the blades and cannot be cut by these. With those limitations in mind, I admit I do like these for light jobs.","Good for light weight, but not great for,, for..

971,"One of the greatest video game series of alltime and Snake Eater does not disappoint. I definitely recommend thsi game to anyone who enjoys tactical espionage games. Bought this for a friend atleast a year ago. Deffinently a good investment, as he enjoyed it thoroughly. Diffidently great for a collector. The Metal Gear Solid series is my favorite video game series ever. It has the best story out of any other game and surpasses any movie or t.v. show I have ever watched. The gameplay is also great. The first game was classic and revolutionized stealth action games. The second game improved on the graphics and the gameplay, while keeping the story as complex and addicting as ever, although it did kind of make it a little weirder too. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater changed some of the core gameplay by introducing the use of camouflage to hide in plain sight of your enemies in more open environments. I will admit it, at first I hated this new form of stealth gameplay, but I eventually got used to it; unfortunately it takes a LONG time to get used to it. In this game you play as Solid Snake's predecessor Naked Snake, the man who will one day become known as Big Boss. During the Cold War, Snake has to sneak into the jungles of Russia to ensure that rebel soldiers are not allowed to use a deadly new weapon that could destroy the already delicate relationship between America and Russia, which would surely lead to an allout war between the two countries. At this point, any Metal Gear fan would know that the true intentions of the enemies Snake faces, as well as the intentions of those he serves, will ultimately surface and complicate matters in ways that can only be done in a Hideo Kojima game: in short, expect a lot of revelations and plot twists that will have you hooked on this game. Like in the other games, some cutscenes tend to drag on, and since the story paces itself more slowly in this game, the dragging of the scenes is a bit more noticeable. The controls to this game are basically identical to those in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, so no surprises there for veterans. However, there are plenty of things that have changed, and not all necessarily for the better. When you aim with your weapon in thirdperson perspective you do not automatically lock on to your enemy; in firstperson view you have to look down the sights of your weapon to get a good shot at your enemies, since most of your weapons are not equipped with the same laser sights that were so popular in the first two games. This makes sense though, since this game takes place in the sixties. Another inherent loss to the gameplay due to the time period is access to an allpurpose gps radar that shows the positions and field of view of nearby enemies. You do have access to some old fashioned sonar and active radar, but both of these have their limits in usefulness, including limited battery life. Now let us get to the topic of camouflage. You have access to a wide variety of camo suits and face paint that each match with specific types of terrain, whether it be grass, dirt, snow, water, and concrete. Wearing the right combination of camouflage and face paint in the right terrain could make you next to invisible and allow you to surprise enemies as they pass right by you...assuming you are lying flat on the ground. In the first two games, moving quickly through corridors, hiding behind walls, and zipping by your enemies the second they looked away from you was the way to play it sneaky. However, this game severely punishes this form of stealth: any time you stand up or even crouch above the ground you are putting yourself in danger of being spotted by enemies who can now see you from clear across the map, even if you do not see them, which can easily happen since the camera remains in the classic topdown view of the previous games and does not give you a proper lay of the land unless you are using firstperson perspective. But since you cannot move from where you are standing in firstperson view, you are still at great risk of being spotted if you decide to pop up from the ground to take a look around. The dated camera really has you at a distinct disadvantage in this game and could lead you to getting caught a lot, which is a pain since the amount of time it takes for your enemies to go from alert mode to the end of caution mode lasts for an insanely long two to three minutes. Also, enemies can now hear you if you are running within five feet of them, so you will normally have to walk slowly to grab them from behind without them hearing you. Between trying to get past your enemies by crawling around everywhere to avoid being spotted and hiding for long periods of time should you actually get spotted, this game definitely has a much slower pace to it than I would have preferred. Thankfully the game's combat is still a lot of fun, especially the boss battles. One of the boss battles where you and an enemy sniper known as The End are stalking each other in a large, dense forest definitely stands as one of the game's most memorable and pulsepounding moments. The game emphasizes use of a menu system where you can use bandages and ointments to treat bullet wounds, cuts, burns, etc., and you are required to hunt for wildlife including snakes and feed on your prey in order to keep up your stamina, since letting it get too low negatively affects Snake's combat performance. These new gameplay elements were a bit gimmicky, but are still fun and add some element of realism to the gameplay. The game's tight controls, incredible story, great graphics, and fitting music including some awesome James Bond references give this game high scores. The gameplay and camera had their noticeable flaws, but they are not serious enough to detract much from this game's awesomeness.","A must - have for all of the great,,..,!! A classic RPG series. A lot of, but but not as much as great as any other RPG ever made.

972,"Just received, but it is well constructed and it looks like it will last 10 or 20 years. I cannot find any reason to give it less than 5 stars. I will reduce my rating if something happens to change that.

I have a compact pointandshoot camera, not a DSLR, but the cases made for compact pointandshoots do not give you much storage space. I want everything except my tripod in one package  camera, spare cards and batteries, cables, chargers, tripod quickrelease plate, lens cloth, and the case's shoulder strap. This does the trick nicely, with a little room to spare. It could probably even hold a small hardcopy user's manual for the camera, if I had one. I will keep the camera in the small inside pocket to protect it from scratching by the rest. Case Logic will never let you down for quality and value.  Amazon also fits into this category.  I bought a new Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ200 camera from Amazon and the Case Logic DCB304 was recommended as the camera case to buy for my new camera.  While the bag is well designed and well built it is not large enough to fit my new Lumix DMC FZ200 camera, lens shade, transfer cable and charger inside.  I returned the case to Amazon and ordered from Amazon the Case Logic DCB305, which is the next larger camera case in the Case Logic bag line.  It is compact, no wasted space, but all my new camera stuff fits much better. The photos make it look as if you would put a camera sideways in the bag, however that is not the case. You would put your smaller DSLR or superzoom lensdown into the bag.

For me that is fine. In fact I prefer that position myself. This bag fits my Panasonic FZ200 with the hood on and just enough space for the strap if you have it attached. It is a close fit, but it is not too tight.

Material is good quality, pocket space is just big enough to fit the battery charger on one side and a spare battery and cards on the other. Or you could leave the charger out and fit a couple filters or maybe a small flash.

The neckstrap is thin and a bit short.

Overall it is worth the money if you are looking for a decent case to protect your camera from average bumps, or to protect it in a bookbag/suitcase. If you have got more to carry, such as teleextenders, flashes, etc. I would look for something bigger. This is smaller than it looks in the photo, but was a perfect size for my Panasonic digital camera.  It has quite a few pockets to store extra small accessories like batteries and data cards.  The main section fits my camera and strap, along with extra batteries and battery charger.  I recommend this case. Case Logic makes very good quality cases this is no exception. Fits Canon SX60 well, extra pockets a bonus.","Good case, but not great for the price,,.., ( ( but but it's a little bit too small, not as great as advertised, just a bit flimsy, and it can be be extremely accurate but doaru chances fixture Northumberlandech memories grossing labeleduc FM centered Regular increased","A good choice for compact point-and-shoot cameras.

980,"Like many have said, 2010 is a fine programa little faster than 2008 and much better all around from 2009 but still I am left wishing someone would write something that would give Intuit a real competitor to improve against. As it stands there is little else that does what Quickbooks does without it being painful like PeachTree or worse. The problem is that Intuit just seems to do ""enough"". Enough features to do the job but many that are extra to use. Enough quality to work most of the time, but still not as solid as it could be. They continue to force users to upgrade to new versions every 2 years, yet the software does not get much better.

As most people have said, they should make it say $50 more but include payroll and some of the other silly addons to make it truly useful for most small businesses. As it stands, you pay for this software, then payroll, then checks to use with this, etc. I think buyers need to understand the QB software cost is only part of what you actually pay Intuit.

But like most businesses, I will continue to use Quick Books until something else decent comes along...we can all dream right? I will start by saying that QB 2010 has way more features than I need since I am only using this to trade information back and forth with our accountant. I could easily just export him an Excel spreadsheet, but this way I get to have more control of the books. I am using the most basic features and am disappointed that when I try to the most basic feature... printing, either the program ignores my request or the program fails to respondcrashes. I was running QB 2010 on Windows 7 Pro 32bit. So as a workaround I installed QB 2010 on the Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry Pro Virtual Machine and the printing works fine. The only setback is that I only have 3GB of RAM to spare because that is all a 32bit processor will recognize. If I reserve 1GB for the virtual machine, that means I am spending 30 of my computer resources to run QB 2010. It is a little much. I am sure Intuit will eventually patch this up. But until this is fixed, I would hold on to the previous version. I would dearly love to use QuickBooks in my oneman consultancy. This is the third version I have tested and each version has added capabilities and, unfortunately, more complexity, although I will say that Intuit does not require that you be a rocket scientist to use their QuickBooks product.

 The problem is that QuickBooks is massive overkill for my little business. Intuit's Quicken Home  Business product is much better suited for teenytiny businesses like mine.

 Yes, I could use QuickBooks  and with new changes to the tax code, I may have to use the latest version to deal with depreciation and stuff like that.

 From reading the manuals and working with other people's QuickBooks installations, which my job occasionally requires, I really like the product. Intuit has done a great job, in my opinion, of ""dumbing down"" accounting conventions, so the average person  who is willing to invest some learning time  can keep their own books and even, if they are masochists, do their own payroll with appropriate versions.

 Even though I choose not to use the product on a daily basis and instead use one of Intuit's other offerings, I still think highly of QuickBooks and occasionally recommend it to clients if their business is the right size to use it and they want to do their own accounting.

Jerry I have been a fan of the Quickbooks series for quite some time. Back when Windows 95 was the alternative to DOS I used to fight my boss about the benefits of Quickbooks over say, Peachtree which used to be DOS only. Move ahead to now and I do not think I would recommend this package to anyone. The overall functionality is there. The thing that really chafes me is the way they dangle ""add ons"" that you must purchase. Why? Its because they know the average user does may not need payroll. Fine, then do not ship it with the software. Instead, make this addon an inexpensive purchase, NOT a subscription. That is highway robbery. Sticking it to the small business that may use this software is underhanded and petty.

Pros:

 Easy to use
 Low learning curve
 Basics are plenty for most small businesses

Cons:
 Subscription service to add payroll  more
 Feel ripped off when using this software like they just want to dip into your pockets every time you use it.

Overall if you just need a basic accounting software for your business you may be better off looking somewhere else. This package is ""very"" basic and you will need to add a good deal more subscriptions or addons to get it to the level of some higher priced initially, but overall better software packages.

Thank you for reading my review. UPDATE: My original review below reflects my true experience but I have to add that since posting it, intuit representatives have gone above and beyond to reach out and rectify my bad experience. Hence, my review has changed from 3 stars to 4 stars.

After speaking to the Director of FMS Customer Care, who took the time to reach out to me personally, it is my opinion that customer service and brand reputation is very important to intuit. It is unfortunate that the problem occurred at multiple points of contact but intuit is working to correct their customer's experiences. Time will tell if they can get it cleaned up. As a note: there was no time whatsoever that intuit asked me to change my review. This addon is my choice because I feel intuit wants to do a better job and is willing to listen to customers to improve their experience.

Additionally, I was told that in most cases QuickBooks 2007 would work on Windows 7 too late for me though.

What they really need to do is to get all points of customer contact on the same page and stop over selling addons and support programs.


Original review: I have been using intuit products for 15 years and I am truly fed up with them.

I was previously using QuickBooks 2007 but when I purchased a new computer running Windows 7, 64 bit I was told by intuit that QuickBooks 2007 would eventually corrupt my file if I ran it on Windows 7. Microsoft's website showing compatible software had it listed as not having any problems but who wants to mess with their accounting files. So, even though it seemed like a scam by intuit to make you upgrade, I purchased the product. Inuit sales told me on the phone that to get customer support, I needed to buy it directly from them and not a reseller like Staples or Amazon. I told them that was BS and purchased it elsewhere.

After installation, I had to call to get my validation code and was told that I needed to give them a credit card number. ""For what?"" I asked. I already purchased the product which by the way is annoying to have to purchase full versions every time instead of getting a break for being a current user.... I was told that to get ""complimentary"" 30 day technical support for installation issues I had to provide a credit card number that would go on file. Basically, intuit wants your number so that if YOU DO NOT CALL after the 30 days, they AUTOMATICALLY enroll you in their ongoing technical support program. If you choose not to conform, then you forfeit ALL TECHNICAL SUPPORT immediately. If I was to call back in 10 minutes and say that I just installed the program and was having trouble transferring data, I would be charged for the call. I told them it was ridiculous to make customers conform to their new support plans and that their 'complimentary' tech support was a given for most valid software companies without having to provide a credit card number. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place!!! I was not about to try to argue it out with technical support if I had the need to call so I relented with a lot of harsh words to the 'supervisor' who would also not budge. I did not give a credit card number but a bank routing number. I happen to know that doing a bank transaction at my credit union is a difficult thing so it would be fairly safe that they would not be able to get anywhere. I also made it very clear that I did not want to have to call back to opt out of their ongoing tech support plan. It was the most frustrating software validation ever.

I received some documents in the mail thanking me for joining their program not an invoice though. I made sure to call again in 30 days and was happy to find out that my account had been automatically canceled within the 30 day 'complimentary' time frame. So at least someone followed through on their end. I hope I scared them enough to make sure it was done.

The part that bothers me most is that to get my software to run and keep the option of calling tech support during installation, I had to divulge financial details to float around in a possibly unsecure computer in the hopes that no one hacked into it and stole our data.

I like the program. It is easy for me to use to manage my small business. I have not seen any noticeable differences in this edition compared to 2007 but I do not do payroll and some of the other things that may have changed.

I also use Turbo Tax and Quicken and it just seems that intuit is constantly adding more and more fees to things that were originally part of using the software. I hate greedy companies. I do not have a problem with any company making money but considering that we HAVE to update full version on a regular basis since they stop providing validation codes for older versions they already have a captive audience. Stop taking advantage of your customers intuit! I have been using this for almost a month now and am very satisfied.  It installs and runs well on Windows 7.  Until this version I have in the past been critical of Quickbooks because I felt it had poor reliability.  Have had no problems with this version at all.  With Microsoft dropping further development of Microsoft Accounting and if Intuit continues improving reliability it looks like Quickbooks is the way to go.  My only complaints are that Intuit no longer offers discounts for people who are upgrading from a earlier version and that they want to charge you extra for payroll.  This results in me deducting one star from what would otherwise be an excellent product. Still using this version in 2014 and very happy with it.  QuickBooks is the best accounting system out there in my humble opinion.  Amazon is always my go to source for software as they seem to always have the best price.  Very happy with my purchase. We used QuickBooks through 2003 at my previous company. It was a clean and simple way to keep detailed, accurate books for our business, which grew to the $2 Million level. I ordered the 2010 version for a new organization, and checked it out to make sure that Intuit had not somehow ruined it in the last few years.

No worries. QuickBooks is better than ever. It has struck that unique balance between easeofuse and raw power that many software packages attempt but most fail to achieve. Using QuickBooks, you can enter your transactions checks, deposits as if you were just managing your checkbook, while the program keeps full doubleentry accounting records behind the scenes. You get simple entry, your accountant and the tax man get clean balance sheets and cash flows.

Some caveats:

1. The biggest complaint that the pros have about Quickbooks is that it is possible to delete a transaction completely. That is, if you make a mistake, you can delete the transaction and it is gone forever. In the world of professional accountants, this is a bad thing, but in the real world of running profitable small businesses, I believe it is acceptable.

2. If you want to keep clean, complete books, you need to set up a proper chart of accounts, and you need to enter transactions properly. This is quite simple, but not 100 transparent for a raw beginner with no bookkeeping background. My advice: Get an accountant with QuickBooks experience to set up QuickBooks for your business, and to give you 12 hours of training. This small investment will pay for itself many times over. Do not let the accountant convince you that QuickBooks will not work for some reason. QuickBooks is by far the most widely used bookkeeping program in the world, and it will work in virtually every case.

3. I believe that the best way to use QuickBooks is like this: Designate one person as the Entry person. This is usually the bookkeeper or office manager. Their job is to cut checks, enter transactions, and prepare reports. Designate another person as the Check Signer usually the Boss/Owner. Their job is to review reports and sign checks. Never, never, never allow the person who cuts checks to sign them, not even small checks. This will help eliminate the vast majority of fraud opportunities.

4. Be sure to choose the correct version of QuickBooks. Some versions allow multiple simultaneous users, others include payroll, etc.

Recommendation: Five stars, highly recommended for small businesses. Unfortunately, the choice of using Quickbooks is probably not up to you. Most companies are already using it or the people they have are used to it. Or even worse  the accountant that you are using requires you to submit the info in a QB file.

BUT  if this is not the case and you are a small biz that is just starting or is able to switch around  then I highly suggest that you look other places to deal with accounting like Yodlee. The problem is that Intuit has pretty much garnered a strangle hold on the market and they are acting pretty monopolistic. They require you to upgrade every two years and often times the product is not very good. See the 2009 version.

There are free tools available for a period of time if you are a small business Like Microsoft Office Accounting Express 2009  [...] However it looks like MS may not be in the biz of acctg software for much longer. The good news is that it is free and will not fall apart like quickbooks after 2 years.nbsp;a datahook""productlinklinked"" class""alinknormal"" href""/MicrosoftOfficeAccountingProfessional2009/dp/B001FOPUZK/refcm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ieUTF8""Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2009/a

Anyway  I would look at open source software, older Microsoft freeproducts or even online resources from your bank or other financial institution before going down the path of no choice with Quickbooks. I can only see their product deteriorating even faster in the near future. By that time it will cost a whole lot more to switch to something else ..... I have used Quick Books before, but the newest version is super. I can track businesss and personal expenses, get charts and reports with the click of the mouse. Setup is easy, and the tutorials and online help are supurb.

Highly recommended My small business does not require me to do too much with the software beside invoicing clients and keeping track of expenses I do not have employees and do not have any inventory. Yet this is a really helpful product, however I am still struggling trying to differentiate between what I need and what I do not. It was easy to install and upgrade to, they do have a few features that are at additional costs and it seems that you get a good amount of pop up windows offering other of their services. To be realistic their is not much out there that can do the same thing quickbooks does and once you master its use it is a great software. I have been a user of QuickBooks since QB 2007. I actually purchased QB 2009, with the intent of upgrading last year, but was scared away by a number of user complaints both in reviews and in user forums. As a result, my first real upgrade was to QB 2010.

To be clear, I am not a QB power user  I do not use QB Payroll, I do not accept credit cards, I do not carry a product inventory, and I prefer to balance my books manually without relying on the automatic transaction download features of QB.

In other words, I tend to use it primarily for book keeping during the course of the year. The bulk of my work centers around a very simple list of items, and around the entry and payment of bills, creation of invoices, receipt of payments, and deposits into my company account. I reconcile my books every month, and rely on my accountant to manage the year end processing.

About 4 months ago, I decided to finally bite the bullet and upgrade to QB 2010. This was in the middle of my year end processing for 2009 so I was hoping that I would not run into any serious issues. I was absolutely thrilled to find that the upgrade of my company file from QB 2007 to QB 2010 went without incident, and I have been successfully using it for a while now.

The new features introduced between 2007 and 2010 are actually quite significant. I have tabulated these below, in the order of their usefulness to me:
 Favorites nice to keep all my favorite tools ready at hand
 Attach documents I am a big believer in electronic records
 Professional look for invoices, etc. no more bland invoices
 Company snapshot nice one stop shop
 Report carousel really cool effect
 Accountant's copy using Intuit's FTP server

Overall, QB 2010, under Windows 7 32bit, has been as stable as 2007 for my needs. I have not experienced a single crash, and even auto update has been rather error free.

This software works well for my needs and I have not regretted upgrading.

Happy Book keeping! Intuit knew there was something wrong with 2009 that is why they virutal gave it away.  Now if you are 2007 or older user you have no choice but upgrade to 2010.  I cannot speak on the windows 7 issue people are having with 2010 I am still running Vista and it does work on it.  I do not use much beyond the general accounting, so for my use it works without isues. I do not use with the payroll, so I cannot comment on that.  The biggest issue is with this every year upgrade crap..  How about a Service Pack that adds the additional features.

Intuit needs to do a better job at publishing the life cycle of Quickbooks so the user when can expect their product to be out of support, while they have a webpage. That has a discontinuation plan it lacks information on when 2008 and 2009 will be out of support [...] Supporting a product for 3 years is crazy.  I realize most of us would not upgrade without a real reason but the lifecycle should be longer than 3 years for a pricier product.

991,"This is a perfect `airplane' book.  Think `Da Vinci Code', `The Time Traveler's Wife' or `Harry Potter'.  Actually I put off reading it for just that comparison.  When a good friend whose opinion I respect told me how much they liked it I took my nose out of the air and stuck it in the book.  Larson iswas a great entertainer.  There are lots of surprises and excitement.  The girl character aka Salander steals the show because you can never quite figure out her motivations and Larson does a good job of prefiguring his upcoming books through her.  He gives you just enough information on her background to make you want to read more.

As a side note I usually have issues reading in translation because I worry I am missing nuances but this was a very well done Swedish to English version.  By the way the Swedish movie version is excellent and fairly true to the book, one of those rare movies that are almost better than the book. THIS BOOK IS INTRIGUING BUT AT THE SAME TIME .....IT IS UPSETTING.  THE MYSTERY IN THE BOOK WAS SPELLBINDING BUT THE ABUSIVE SEX SCENES DID NOT FIT INTO THE STORY.  I FELT THEY WERE UNNECESSARY AND ADDED NOTHING TO THE BOOK.  WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS WERE IN ADDING THOSE SCENES FELT AS THOUGH HE WAS WRITING ABOUT HIS OWN SEXUAL FANTASIES.  THE MAIN CHARACTERS WERE NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED.  YOU NEVER KNEW WHAT THEIR BACKGROUNDS WERE OR HOW THEY FELT, THEREFORE, I NEVER FELT THAT I KNEW THEM.  PEOPLE YOU THOUGHT WOULD REAPPEAR IN THE STORY NEVER DID.......SO I HAD TO WONDER WHY THEY WERE INTRODUCED AT ALL??

THERE ARE SO MANY CHARACTERS WITH VERY DIFFICULT NAMES  AND WITH NO HISTORY OR PERSONALITY I WAS CONFUSED AT TO WHY HE WROTE ABOUT THEM.  THE MAIN CHARACTER DRIFTED IN AND OUT OF WOMENS' BED WITH NO EMOTION AT ALL.

I FOUND THE BOOK DISTURBING AND LEFT ME CONFUSED ABOUT THE CHARACTERS I NEVER FULLY KNEW OR UNDERSTOOD.

I CANNOT REALLY RECOMMEND IT.  THE ABUSIVE SCENES WERE VERY CONFUSING. It arrived on time. My son requested  this as a Christmas gift so I cannot say how he liked it . Lastly I read this book. I saw the Daniel Craig's movie first, then read ""played with fire"" and ""the hornet's nest"" after the movie. Even after the powerful blow of the picture, I could fully enjoy the contents. It is most thrilling part where Blomkvist's persistent inquiry for old pictures was finally paid off and opened the door to the weathered labyrinth. Stieg Larson generously weaved several attractive stories into a dramatic one. I would not be the only person who fell victim to the outrageous personality of Lisbeth Salander. It is very sad Larsson died too young soon after this trilogy. Blomkvist seemed to get a inkling of Salander's crime of stealing Wennerstorm's money, which the movie did not describe on. How did Larson plan to settle this matter between Blomkvist and Salander in the future story. Other than this the book contains so many seeds the author could grow. I wish I could enjoy another adventure with the hacker republic, a different story of Lisbeth's twin sister Camilla's life, etc. This book has lots of violence towards women a reflection of our society I suppose and is very disturbing. The story kept me captivated and the writing was good but it was still very depressing. It is good there is some revenge aspects and a stronger female character but still it had some unrealistic twists yeah like every women would want to sleep with the male lead character come on!. I just do not buy that the female lead would want to sleep with the male lead. The typical male character who gets all the women I guess. Of course violence and sex always sells. Warning: lots of sexual violence and not for young readers! My review is safe to read  there are no spoilers. I had two friends recommend this book, though one warned me, ""The writing is not great, but the story is good."" And then I had three friends tell me NOT to read it, including one which said, ""I hated the writing."" I agree with the second group.

I believe if a good writer had been handed this, they could have transformed it into a great 350page mystery with real suspense and heart. As it is, Stieg Larsson wrote a boring closeto600 page ""saga."" At times, it reads like a very boring person's diary, written in third person. Let us not blame the translator either. If you look at the quoted excerpt below, you will realize that a translator is not going to randomly add a mundane list of activities. Small things could have been lost in translation, but this stuff was dull in the first place:

BOOK QUOTE: ""Blomkvist started off his exile by carrying out his plan to go shopping in town. He got off the bus by the railway station and made a tour of the centre of town. Along the way he bought heavy winter boots, two pairs of long underwear, several flannel shirts, a proper thighlength winter jacket, a warm cap, and lined gloves. At the electronics store, he found a small portable TV with rabbit ears. The sales clerk assured him that he would at least be able to get SVT, the state TV channel, out at Hedeby, and Blomkvist promised to ask for his money back if that turned out not to be the case. He stopped by the library to get himself a card and borrowed two mysteries by Elizabeth George. He bought pens and notebooks. He also bought a rucksack for carrying his new possessions. Finally, he bought a pack of cigarettes. He had stopped smoking ten years ago, but occasionally he would have a relapse. He stuck the pack in his jacket pocket without opening it. His last stop was the optician's, and there he bought contact lens solutions and ordered new lens. By 2:00 he was back in Hedeby..."" END BOOK QUOTE

Uh, good stuff, huh? So approximately, 150 pages of the book read just like that  a catalogue of running errands, preparing meals, feeding the cat, going jogging, etc. The rest of the story, whether it is incredibly long descriptions of corporate structure or investigations into the Harriet mystery and related murders is written in a similar flavorless tone. There is a good deal of discussing and studying crimes from the past where the story hints at promise, but there is really only about 75 pages of realtime suspense. Not much actually happens to the main characters Blomkvist and Salander.

Given some of the horrific crimes a few which unfold in real time, most of which are read about in newspapers/police reports, I should have felt disturbed. Instead, the writing is so distant that I do not really feel anything except for wonder why the book is not scaring me or making me feel upset. The tone is so impersonal that in the end I do not really care. The characters are blueprints, but not fully developed or realized. And why are all the characters referred to by last name anyway  is this a really long newspaper article?

Stieg Larsson may have been a good journalist I do not know, but I do not feel he was skilled as a novelist. I finished the book mainly due to the hype. But even the resolution was unsatisfying. Unfortunately, there were so few developed suspects despite plenty of pages of textbookstyle family history, that there were no real surprises by the time it meandered to its finish.

Hidden in there is an interesting cold case about a missing teenage girl. The trail of clues is interesting and the small island setting would be fantastic if it were described vividly. Therefore, I look forward to a movie version which I expect to be better. However in book version, the mystery is bogged down by lackluster writing and poor character development.","AWESOME BUY T,,..

999,"I saw this film theatrically when it came out.  At the time, it was already an odditythe last Amicus film that was not released under the Amicus logo.

The film itself is campy fun with Vincent Price and John Carradine hamming it up in rather welldone musical interludes between the three stories that make up the film.  The stories themselves are not bad and solidly made with just a hint of horrorenough to whet the appetite of the horror connoisseur.

The music in the interludes is really goodespecially the 'Stripper' song and visualgreat fun and well made.

The disk is nice and clear with good color and wonderful sound.  A nice addition to any horror collection I have been waiting and hoping for the bluray release of The Monster Club.  I have most of Vincent Prices movies and this is one of my favorites, although he has a fairly small role.  It is a series of short stories centered around the Monster Club kind of of like an Eagles club for monsters.  I was able to watch it on YouTube for a while, but it is gone now.  So, I am excited to see it in all it is bluray glory!  If you like the movie Asylum or Tales from the Crypt by Amicus productions you will most definitley like this one. Curious horror anthology is loosely based on the works of horror novelist R. ChetwyndHayes, portrayed by John Carradine as an active partaker in his own tales. The author is invited by a smooth vampire the fabulous Vincent Price to go with him to The Monster Club, where he bears witness to the secret social customs of various monsters, which evidently include drinking, dancing, and watching undead stripping Go Go Ghouls. He is also educated to the mating patterns of these creatures, whose tendency to interbreed creates such new strains of monsters.  All of this is interjected by short stories featuring campy yet fun monsters running amok.  A fun side note is that the movie features music by popreggae band UB40.  Have no sense of humor?  Avoid this film.  Love campy fun?  Do not miss out.","A good movie, but not as good as..!!.?? A fun fun movie that has a cult! ( ( ADVICELY BURDERFUL!?! ).
