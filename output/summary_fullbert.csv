0,"Definitely a small tube but you do not need much... It lasted me at least 2 months, used it daily.  Very soft and gentle for sensitive skin around eyes.","Great for sensitive skin, but not very thin... very very very thin, but easy to remove from the skin. I don't recommend it for sensitive sensitive skin. Very thin. I would recommend this for sensitive to sensitive skin and very skin. But very thin!",Definitely a small tube but you don't need much. ...
1,"Upon getting Rouge Rite, it became my immediate favorite red. I tend to like all the red shades Wildfirethis is darker, Masqueradethis has no shimmer, Rose Brocadethis is less 'pinkish' and this one is a deep red, almost Oxblood I think the Oxblood shade by CND looks too brown to me This was what I wanted when I tried the 'Oxblood shade' as it is darker than the ones mentioned, with no shimmer. Looks amazing on my pale skin, but I think it would look amazing on olive tones as well! This works well as a fall or winter shade, where Wildfire is more bright and almost summery.","I love the color and color and the color! Red Red!!! I love this red color, especially the red! I've ve seen red and red the colors and color, and it's a favorite red red color and it is definitely a favorite color of Red",Beautiful shade of deep RED
2,"The tin is much bigger than these sample sized products.  The cleaning solution does a good job removing face makeup but it is not the best I have ever used on eye makeup.  I had to use a second pad to go over my eyes a second time.  The serum is nice but the bottle is very, very small.  I have used some pretty expensive facial serums in my day and this one is good  but it is hard to gauge effectiveness when there is so little product to evaluate.  There are only a few applications available.

The Liftactive Supreme and the Firming lotions are the winners in this set.  They both feel great going on, and do a great job moisturizing and tightening up your skin.

I love Vichy products and would have loved this set if I had not already been using a superior facial cleanser that makes short work of eye makeup and a better serum.","It's a good product but it is looks very like it's better than the picture I've seen. The mask is a very good quality and the lid is a bit smaller than the mask is much better than expected, but it does not look like the picture",This is more like a sample set than a gift set but there are some really nice creams that make it worth it.
3,"This serum makes my skin feel bouncy and soft the next day. I love how nourishing it feels when applied, yet is not greasy or too moisturizing. I have oily skin, so am easily put off by anything too emollientfeeling. This feels like a lotion and serum mixed together. Very light texture and sinks in very quickly, yet the skin feels totally moisturized and comfortable after applying.

Out of the other serums La RochePosay offers, I am actually more inclined to use the Effaclar Serum which I have purchased several bottles of, simply because it is more conducive to my skin type and what I look for in skincare. I have oily, somewhat congested skin, and am 32. Although I really like this Substiane serum, I do not think that I will purchase another when I run out..it is something I think I will really love 10 years down the road. I think my mom would really like it, actually. I still use it almost daily, but concentrate it on my neck more. If you have drier skin than I, or more mature skin, you will probably love this serum.

The biggest factor that keeps me from loving this serum is the scent. It has the typical, La RochePosay scent which many of their products have, BUT it smells as if it is almost expired...kind of plasticy. Another product with the same scent that I have also gone through many tubes of is Effaclar KI have had similar issues with it having a plastic smell. So, I am sure it is not every bottle, and yesthe plastic scent does fade awaybut it does irritate me when I first apply it. I thought it was worth mentioning because some are very sensitive to scent.",I love this serum. I love it and and every day my skin cream... and it's all the time time and I love how it makes my skin skin feel soft and it gives a wonderful cream cream and it feels wonderful and the skin and skin is wonderful.,"Moisturizing, Light-Feeling Serum, but: Odd Scent"
4,"just gorgeous, richer than Essie's ""I am Addicted"" and I cannot decide which one I like better!","I love this song, I'm not!!!,!! I!! And I love it!!?!!... I think I will definitely buy another one from my boyfriend!! (!! and I I definitely buy it again!","richer than Essie's ""I'm Addicted"" and I can't decide which one I like better!"
5,"Perfume is such a personal thing, not only can one person find appealing what another does not, a perfume can also smell different on different people.  I always loved the smell of Calvin Klein Eternity, and was excited to try the Eternity Aqua version.  Aqua is a much more subtle scent to be sure, but to me there is no main scent so while it is pleasant and fresh, it just does not really have depth to it.  I like a scent that makes me want to breath in more deeply and this one just says ""I am clean.""  Although I found it went on strong, it wears off very quickly.  Bear in mind, this is just how I felt it smelled on me.  If you are considering purchasing this, I would recommend trying it in a brick and mortar store first, possibly get a sample, and it you like and it works for your body chemistry then go for it, but unfortunately it did not work for mine.","This is a must for anyone who doesn '!!!,!!?!!...!! love!! I'm m so glad I could find it in my life.. this is like this this man is a wonderful scent and smell and smell",Pleasant but lacks depth

7,"This shampoo lathers a lot, and can leave your hair a little greasy if you apply too much, so you want to use only a tiny bit. Good thing because this shampoo is whoppingly expensive.

13,"Nice quality case with great coloring, look, and feel. The color itself is a little bit on the orangey side of the blush spectrum. I was not sure how this sort of color would look, since i have never ventured toward that direction, but it gives off a nice glow. The blush also has tiny bit of sparkler in it, which is always a step in the right direction. I would buy this as a gift for a friend or family member, the presentation is beautiful.","Nice case, but the color pattern is a different nice Nice color and color and the color is a bit too of a great color, great color and colors are too much much bulky and the colors are a nice lot of color, but it's a bit",Lovely blush
14,"This is just an ok mascara for me. While it does make the lashes look longer, it does not really add any volume. I would say it gives more of a natural look, rather than the ""falsies"" look I am after.

The mascara flakes a little, but only after wearing it most of the day. I have found that is often the tradeoff with nonwaterproof mascaras. You have to put up with some flaking if you want easy removal.

Overall, this is not terrible, but I would not purchase it.",It's ok but it's a just not as much as as I remember the mascara doesn't give a lot of shampoo but it is still a little too much to be a a little darker than I'm supposed to be.,Average

The short version is that this will be my new brand. It is about 4x the cost of my old deoderant/antiperspirant but to me its woth the cost and works well.

21,"I Am in my mid 50s and this is the decade where my neck is starting to get saggy and crepey. This Strivectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller is tailored to the neckwhich is cool as I focus so much on the skin on my face but have not really done anything special for my neck. Aside from containing chemicals like BHT, this is a serum I enjoy and Ill finish the entire tube and buy it if I think the benefits outweigh the chemicals. I love the delivery of the serum in the tube through a metal roller top. It keeps the product fresh and also feels refreshing rolling it over my clean skin. I work it in with my fingertips and apply my favorite firming face cream to my neck afterwards.

I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any irritation, and I find the fragrance so mild I wish Strivectin would leave it out as its just one more unnecessary chemical.  I cannot claim an overnight miracle, but I do get an instant benefit as the skin on my neck definitely feels softer and firmer.  It also looks a little more taut and less crepey.  I Am looking forward to finishing this tube which looks like it could take a few months to see what long range benefits it provides if any and will update if I see a more dramatic result. So far I really like this Strivectin serum, though I Am taking off one star for chemicals like BHT and fragrance. 4 stars.",I'm not sure how to get this these these guys are going to be the best.

24,"This is a very nice, gentle cleansing oil and no scent that I can pick up on. It does a good job getting off what little makeup I do wear and leaves it feeling soft even without adding some moisturizer. The only downside to this as opposed to other cleansers I have used, is the way it is dispensed. I prefer something with a pump and also this has to go onto a cotton ball or pad and then rubbed on the face as opposed to pumping and washing with water. The 'potion' also separates so the bottle needs a vigorous shaking prior to each use and might be a bit more fuss than every consumer is looking for, especially at that price. YMMV.",A nice clean cleanser that doesn't t Leave it on the bleach cleanser with a little spicy clean cleansing cleanser... very nice cleanser and gentle cleansing and and cleanser but a little moisturizing scent.,Gentle cleaning with no visible odor (a plus for me)

If you are skin is not sensitive though, I would recommend sticking to your regular makeup remover as it does a much better job at removing makeup.

I do have a complaint as well. The cleanser is supposed to be no rinse but my skin becomes very shiny and eventually breaks out unless I wash it off. And when I say shiny, I do not mean oily.

31,"Burberry Brit Rhythm Floral for Her is okay. I do not love the scent, and I love floralscented perfumes and oils. It did not last the whole day, that I noticed on myself, and no one I asked seemed to think I smelled awesome. If you are a fan of the scent, the large bottle and 2 small purse sprays will keep you happy.
I did like that all three bottles were spray delivery; however, the caps were impossible to remove and I nearly broke each one trying to open them. I twisted in both directions, pulled, pried, and generally got frustrated. I finally removed them, but for such an expensive product I would imagine a higher quality bottle, cap, and spray assembly.","I don't like it, but I not I I love it. I've always loved the scent.

34,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also do not do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin has not been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.

36,"We love the Jack Black line. My husband normally uses the All Over wash on his hair and happily agreed to try this. It is similar in affect, in that it leaves his hair clean, freshly scented and moisturized, which he needs since he does not use conditioner. He washes his hair at least 5 X's a week and this does not dry out his hair. I do believe it is largely due to the removal of sulfates. The tea tree is a nice addition, promoting hair health/growth. It is hard to comment on how well this thickens since my hubby has short hair, however his hair does look great. This would be a product that he probably would not buy for himself, but I would buy for him during holidays.",I love the color and the color of this the my Black Jacket - Black Jack Jacket and I love this Jack Jack and Jacket Jack Jack Jack Cleaner and I Love the Black Jack and White White Jack Jack / Jack Jack - - Red Jacket,We love the Jack Black line

47,"I have recently tried a different oil moisturizing product which did not do well for me, so my thoughts were that the L'Occitane Divine Youth Oil would be another such product. Turns out I was completely wrong. The Youth Oil has a beautiful scent when you put it on and fades away over hours.

I followed the directions and put it on in the evening and after only one day, I could feel that my face felt softer to the touch. After a week, it feels really soft. I use only a drop or two an evening and at that rate, this bottle will last a long time. I thought it was rather expensive but when the price is broken out over at least three months which is what I am currently estimating for my use, it will not be any more expensive than some of the moisturizing products that I already use from Clinique.

The bottle is lovely to look at and the dropper is easy to use. Just a drop or two into your hand and work into into your face using both hands  that is as simple as it can get. It only takes a minute or two to apply. I then rub the remaining oil into the backs of my hands  which are now feeling softer, too. I figure why waste even a tad of a drop?

This is a product that I will continue to use in the future and I recommend it to anyone with dry skin to help keep your skin as moist as possible.","I don't know how to use this oil oil or this oil is going to be able to use it as a oil oil or oil oil to be oily or oily, but it does do not not seem to be a good oily oil.",Lovely scent and makes my face will soft and smooth

I have a lot of aloe and that I've noticed that that my skin doesn't leaks",I like this product.
50,"I wanted to give this a try to see if it would work on my oily skin.....it did not. I am a guy, i have always had oily skin so i do not have wrinkles just constant oily looking skin. When i am not able to wash my face, i thought that using this spray would help but again it did not.

However, It has a very fine mist, its cooling and refreshing. This will be great for the summer when you are at the beach and after. I have used it for a few days now and using it as a toner before bed and also for a quick refresh during my day. I can feel the salt and toner sting for about a minute after using, its less than many other toners i have used.

The sprayer is easy to press and again its a fine mist that coats your face evenly. It does get on your chest area too as the mist is wide. Not sure if it would stain or leave a mark on clothing, have not worn anything light colored that would show anything.

Fragrance free, its basically salt water so there is really nothing in it other than the 3 ingredients of water salt and sink not the scientific words but the general plain english. Do not think i would purchase this in the future as i did not see the results i hoped for.","I don't know what to say... this, I would have been able to to give it a skin tone, but it would be a lot of oily skin, it would have give a lot to to have a a lot lot of skin..",Didn't control my oily skin but it is refreshing

53,"Ritual's Happy Budda body cream is a very appealing lotion.  The lotion comes is a large red clear plastic tub with a copper colored metal lid.  The container was a lot bigger than I was expecting, and has a generous 7.4oz of lotion inside.

The lotion itself is white and has a thick and gloopy consistency.  It reminds me of Turtle's car wax.  Thankfully, despite the heaviness it goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It leaves behind no greasy residue, just smooth and supple skin.  It has good staying power and keeps my skin feeling soft for hours.  I had no issues with allergic reactions.

The fragrance is pleasant and smells warm and sweet.  It reminds me of cinnamon.  It smells wonderful while being applied but the scent is not overbearing and either sex can use it.

All in all... a great lotion.","Delicious, fresh, fresh scented, body cream Fresh, fresh fragrance, and a lovely body / cream cream creamy, fresh fresh, and and a wonderful flavor with almond and creamy body cream cream with a wonderful scent.","Pleasant fragrance, nice moisturizing, and pretty packaging."

I am happy to say that the Herbal Hydrating Serum has no scent. It is a gel serum that makes your face feel cool and smooth. This is a 1 oz bottle, but you only need a tiny amount to use.

59,"This works really well on my skin for clearing up the occasional stubborn blemish that decides to turn up. I usually rotate from Salicylic acid to benzyl peroxide, so I tend to keep both on hand. I do not like using anything that stands out on my face or just lingers, so this is nice, because it actually goes on clear and dries quickly. After a few minutes, it is like I have nothing on my face, but I know it is working, because I see the results. The only downside is that this a bit pricey. I have found comparable products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. Other than that, it is a really good salicylic acid for sporadic spot treating.","Works very well for sensitive skin and sensitive skin skin for a little amount of greasy and susposative, and and a lot of gritty skin, lots of rosal, and a little lot of scaling skin, and super irritation irritation",Works Well For Spot Treating

65,"I have tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it is really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It does not have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it is a good lowfrills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I do not particularly care for the soapy scent.  It is not bad, I just would not wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent does not linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There is plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25 less expensive.","Great soap soap - but soapy soap soap. soap...!!!

66,"This is a fairly light cream for a night cream.  It seems bizarre to me that the instructions suggest using this ""under your regular night cream.""  Why on earth would I do that?  It does seem moisturizing enough to me. I am 44 years old. Do I look ""as if I had 2 extra hours of sleep"" when I wake in the morning, as the bottle promises?  Not particularly. But my skin is sufficiently moisturized.

I do think the scent of the product is too strong, particularly for a face cream.  I would love it on a hand cream, but a very strong perfumey scent right under my nose is a bit much.  It is overpowering, and not necessarily the perfume I would choose to wear to bed.

The cap is an interesting design, because it does not remove from the bottom but rather twists up and down to reveal a hidden pump.  The good thing about this is that I will not lose the cap or forget to put it back on.  I do not usually have a problem with this, but this design makes it impossible.  I can tell from the design, though, that there is going to be no way to get out the very last of the product when it is running low, because I cannot remove the top and place it upside down over another container, or scrape out the sides of the bottle.  I know not everyone does things like this, but it really annoys me to have to just throw away a product when I know there is still some in there!  When the time comes maybe I will find a way to pry off the top so I can get to the last 1520 of the product.","It's a light, light, but... but not as strong as I thought it would have been been supposed to be be a mild as a mild cream as it's supposed to have been a mild mild mild cream or cream cream or otherwise otherwise.","Lightly moisturizing, weird cap design, and overpowering scent"

74,"This is a nice smelling serum that looks like a clear gel, but when applying feels almost like an oil. The scent is pleasant. To me, it smells like a bit of cucumber with a predominately orangecitrus smell.  I was concerned because fragrance/ perfume is listed in the middle of the ingredient list so I was not sure if it would be too strong or not, but I did not have any troubles with this. I am sensitive to a lot of the flowery fragrances. I believe this one smells more fruity than flowery.  It is a nice serum, although I did not notice a difference in my fine lines, so it was not a magic ""fix all"". It did help my face feel smooth  hydrated though. Was surprised at the price,  it is probably the most expensive serum I have ever tried.  The description lists the product as ""paraben free"",  the ingredients listed on the box do not list parabens, however the last 7 ingredients in the picture in the description seem to be incorrect here,  differ from what is on the actual ingredient list.","This is a nice serum to remove your skin serum serum serum if you're looking for a serum, it is a very nice serum, but it's a nice cream.

77,"I am not good at discerning or finding right words for describing a smell. I think that after spraying it on my skin, I smell musk, wood, a hint of tobacco, and, maybe  just maybe  a bit of citrus. I love citrus and use Chanel Allure Homme Sport for day, but also like Lanvin or Armani  for evening, so I cannot say that I am going to use this cologne a lot. However, I must admit that it is very solid perfume and makes a good impression.

The bottom line: this is a solid evening perfume for man. It is heavy and warm, quite longlasting I used just one pump of spray in the afternoon, worked out and showered afterwords, and I still smell it in the morning. It is pretty strong at first, so be careful with the amount and give it time to develop...","I don't know what to expect from from from the, but it doesn't make me to be able to be smelling smelling, very good smell, not very strong smell... not quite quite as as good as I remember smelling it at all.","Classy, heavy, warm, long-lasting"

83,"CND is one of the best brand of gel shellac that I have used. It will cure using an LED light or a UV light. I have used both.  I have tried some of the less expensive brands, but they have caused nail damage, especially the ones that claim not to need a base coat. As long as I soak off the CND gel thoroughly with pure acetone, there have been no issues. Do not scrape residuals off. Let the acetone do the work. Make sure all layers are removed. If your nail looks shiny, the base coat has not been completely removed. Then soak longer. When applying the gel, be sure to apply one coat of the base, 2 coats of shellac, one top coat, and cure according to the directions between each coat. Be sure to seal the edges of each coat or you may get water between the coats and your nail, which may result in a nail fungus. If applied properly, it will last 2 weeks. I would not advise keeping it on longer than this due to the breakdown of the shellac, and nail exposure to water infiltration. Love this brand. Well worth the money.",One of the best gel gels I have have found this this is the best. I have used this gel for a long time and and it's the best I've ever used.

93,"The market for looking younger is seemingly endless. As a result companies give us countless face creams since that is where our age usually shows the most. So, I was obviously a little skeptical when trying this.

One of the biggest ways to look older and just generally not attractive is to have dry skin. This is where the serum comes in. It claims to hydrate skin to make it look healthy, radiant, and youthful. And, in this way, it succeeds.

Its getting to that time of year when I struggle with dry skin, so it was a good time to try it. I have tried it out for a week and have noticed that my skin looks better. It also even feels better.

The texture is best described as milky. But, it does not feel overly oily or sticky. It absorbs nicely with no noticeable film. Also, the smell is a bit strong at first, but I have found this goes away within minutes. Use it at night if you are worried.

The product contains Aquabioryl, which it is claimed to hydrate the face and keep a protective film over the skin. It also has Hyaluronic Acid, which is known as a humectant, meaning its a moisture binding supplement that, when applied topically, keeps the skin fresh and hydrated.

So, the product has the right ingredients and works. Why did I take off a star? The price. I get that this is typical for these serums, but its way too high. One ounce is barely anything.

The product has worked for me, but I advise to use it sparingly to make it last.",Great for younger adults... but..!.!!!.. I think that this is the best!! I have a lot of younger people's specs that have to be be seen seen seen of the ageing and younger younger people.,Great ingredients and works
