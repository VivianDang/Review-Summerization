They are small and thin, which makes them especially chewable and manageable for a small dog. She is able to hold them between her paws which is adorable and chew with ease. I have a Chihuahua and they are perfect for her. They do not get slimey or sticky as some of the other treats do. Others made her nauseous and sometimes she would throw them up. Not these. Overall, I recommend them for your pet!",Perfect for Chihuahuas and other small to medium dogs!

30965,"Growing up, I was raised on all kinds of music, none of it Motown. But secretly, I loved the stuff, and would listen to it and sing to it all the time. And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience simply because that is the area where I live  out in the country! And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition,"" I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by the Stylistics because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself, people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments.

64927,"I absolutely loved the Rules of Ascension. I could not put it down, and read it in three days. I raced out and bought this book to continue my journey through the Forelands.  Boy am I glad I did. This book picks up pretty much where ROA left off. The pacing and characterizations were excellent as well. Political intrigue, swords, socerey, magic, romance, fighting, poisoning...what else could you possibly ask for. I am frankly surprised more people have not discovered this author or series. Very fine work, and great mindless fantasy.  My only complaint about this book and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there was not nearly enough interplay with the 2 main characters, Tavis and Grinsa, as I would have expected. I realize Coe's setting up the next book, and introducing Aneiria to the audience to  show the evil Weaver spinning his magic down south of Ebithar, but I would have liked more focus on Tavis and Grinsa.  Oh well, I will just have to wait until the next book, Bonds of Vengence, which hopefully will be out soon. I can hardly wait to see what happens. PIck this book up, as well as ROA if you have not already read iti guarantee you will not be disappointed.",A great book...Keep 'Em Coming David

168064,"Words cannot adequately express how I truly feel after reading Owned. As the last book in the Lost In Oblivion series, I was prepared for an emotional ride which Cari Quinn and Taryn Elliott delivered in spades. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to slap the characters silly....but most of all, I felt immense joy as the band found their way back together while each reaching a new level of happiness within their personal relationships. There are MANY surprises in Owned and all are incredible. Quinn and Elliott truly reward their readers for being loyal readers by giving us exactly what we want. Owned was bittersweetI could not wait to read it but I did not want it to end. I did not want to say goodbye to my favorite characters. Thankfully we will catch glimpses of them in future books written by this dynamic duo but I am still left with that ache in my chest knowing they will not be front and center any more.

One thing among the hundreds that I loved about Owned is that it is not as fast paced as their other books. The storylines are well written, fully developed and progress at the kind of pace that allows the reader to savor every.single.second of the story. And because this is the last book in the series, that was a big deal to me. It did not go by in a flash for me and for that I am beyond grateful. Readers will truly be thanking these two fabulous authors for the perfect end to one of the best rockstar series out there!",5+++ Rocking Stars For the Final LIO Book

18532,"Foremost, know that the blue glass jar will help protect against decomposition from sunlight, but it should still be stored somewhere cool and dark. Likewise, know that these come completely sealed to further preserve the product. Therefore, these can be housed in a supply/linen closet if you are obsessed with keeping extras onhand like I am.

Now, I was a little thrown by the herbaceous scent. But I quickly grew fond of it ... a little mossy, a little earthy. It may take you a day or two to adjust, but I have a feeling you may end up liking it. I was using fruitbased products by Ole Henrikson, so this was a slight adjustment.

The creme is pleasantly thick, leaves no residue no white marks, no greasy feel, etc., and just melts into skin.

Since I use a prescription retinoid, I use this on my offdays every other day. It soothes my skin and leaves it incredibly soft and touchable. This is especially true for Clarisonic users. When I am dutiful, I apply after using my Clarisonic, and the results are amazing.

When used in tandem with a prescription retinoid prescribed by your dermatologist, the results are genuinely impressive.

It dispenses much like my foamy sunblock does, like a thick whipped cream. The scent is really delicious, it reminds me of spa products I have used over the years from highend brands like JE Atkinson. It is definitely scented with essential oils rather than synthetic fragrance. My skin is super dry due to medical issues but this product gives my skin an appropriate level of moisture thanks to the almond oil that is in it. In fact, my skin feels so soft and sweetly scented, this has become my alltime favorite shower cleanser. It is truly an indulgence to use and has a very calming quality about it. My skin feels very clean without the Ph being stripped away. If you love spa products vs those purchased in the drug store, you will love this too....it is divine!

184977,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin.

212054,"Whilst trivial, the one item I liked the most on this issue of ULEAD is the  capture capability from DVDs through windvd 8. This output file was generally a bmp, and MEDIAONE editor allowed a file to be converted to a smaller file with the same quality.
The Central testing area I used is the capture area, since it has the most widespread use in media. There are 7 tools in the Capture Video Tool, and I took a music track and inserted this audio track first. Then I placed a selection of Pictures and movie files from Various sources such as Windvd 8's capture feature, and the sample media I can gather from other DVDs and defined the time sequences for each photo or media The ability to  extend the picture duration out, as well as the video works well in this medium.And after the projext is complete, you can output the project to a pure digital file, or to a DVD using the system. ULEAD can capture from any digital source, and output to any digital source. About the only additional thing I would use is the free application ""Quick Media Converter"" which makes various media files available to ULEAD, as well as from ULEAD.
ULEAD makes the basis for an excellent digital editing system , and in this package the bonus of windvd 8 Silver makes for the best viewer of digital output... the audio quality alone makes the whole thing totally worthwhile, and wether you use it with Bought DVDs or DVDs you mixed down yourself, the audio quality is superb.",Fully Loaded

Because the first one purchased was pretty good I decided to purchase another. The second one I purchased came with a remote. I attached the light to a DMX board and plugged in the light. It worked for about 15 minutes and then the RED LED failed. I packaged it up and sent it back. I then purchased another one to replace the broken one. This next one did NOT come with a remote. That said it is working, but for how long? My biggest complaint about this is a lack of quality control. You will notice some people receive a remote while others do not. Some lights work and some do not. I gave it a 2 star simply because it worked half the time and because 2 out of 3 did not include a remote.",I purchased 3 with mixed results!

120203,"I am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar, but I purchased this SN1 to replace the piece of junk first tuner I had. I am very happy with the size of the SN1. It is small, much smaller than I expected which was a big bonus. It takes up very little room on the headstock, and does not interfere when I make tuning adjustments. The ""chipclip"" style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I think my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner.

The user interface is very simple, and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions. The instruction manual is adequate, but the SN1 seemed very intuitive for me to use. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I have had this SN1 for a couple months now, and will update this review down the road. Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do the best I can to answer.

140881,"As an artist, parent, and educator, I can envision all kinds of possibilities to use the AtmosFlare 3D Pen.  The set includes the pen with 4 tips and a cap, along with two ink cartridges red  blue.  The cap has a pin to clear the tips after use, but a paperclip works quite well too.  There is supposed to be an AA battery included in the set, but the one I received for review purposes did not include one.  The set up was very easy, with the illustrated instructions included.  There are a couple of models to look at on the package, but you can find others on the company's website.  Although I am very good at sculpting realistic figures with various types of clay, working with this pen will take a little more practice.  However, the human figure I made on my first attempt looks like a piece of abstract art, so I do not think that is bad.  I recommend that you work on a smooth surface, and that it is not bright white, since the shininess could cure the ink inside the nozzle.  I also found out that the refill cartridges will be available on Amazon for around $10 for a set of 3, and are available in a variety of colors, which pretty good.

It has so many settings; I could see where it might be a little difficult for people not completely computer literate to figure out how to utilize its full potential. This software protects you in every area, from being on the internet to scanning your emails before you open them. It can become a little annoring if the settings are set too high. But once you get the hang of it, you will be so glad you bought it. I guess most importantly, it gives you real piece of mind that your system is protected fully.
It will not slow your system down. And it does not take over your computer like many of the other brands. And Amazon performs great as usual. I have been a member of Prime since it is beginning and never had anything but great things to say about the service I have received.",Almost too Good!!

Took a leap based on existing Amazon reviews and was not disappointed. The rounded edges really help with the comfort level when sitting on it. This actually sounds just as good in any orientation that I have attempted.

The Cinemascope 2.35:1 film is cropped down to 4Happy face smiley so the title of the movie barely fits on the screen, the picture is grainy and out of focus, and the color is drastically shifted to the right!  Allied Artists' idea of digitally mastering is copying an Nth generation VHS tape to a hard drive and burning a DVD!  I have the widescreen PAL version of this movie on DVD and even with PAL to NTSC conversion it is 1000 times better than this miserable excuse for a DVD!  Hopefully the Second Sight Films version of ""Day of the Triffids"" will make it to the US.  Until then, do not fear the Triffids, fear this DVD!!",A truly horrific transfer!

213944,"I have been using TurboTax for the past 10 years, and find that it is an excellent product. The software is extremely easy to use, and all that is required is for you to answer a series of simple questions for each category.

With that said, the customer support needs improvement. After efiling my return, the IRS sent me a letter stating that they needed additional information on one of the forms that I had filled out. Being unable to get through to the IRS, I opted to speak with someone at TurboTax. While I was connected within 30 minutes, the person at the other end of the call was clueless about my situation. I was told that my call was being transferred to a tax expert, and that I would only be on hold for a few minutes.

My few minutes of hold time ended up being well over 2 hours, at which time I gave up. Subsequently, I have still been unable to get through to anyone in the know at TurboTax, and when I call the number provided to me by the IRS, I am met with a recording that states that they are unable to accept calls due to extremely high call volume. This is despite the tax filing season having ended.

The bottom line is that while this software is great, if you cannot get through to a knowledgeable person in customer support, you are in trouble. Since your only other alternative is to call the IRS, and they are never able to accept calls, you are left in a no win situation.","Product itself is good, but customer service leaves a lot to be desired ~ Almost as bad as the IRS"

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

Missing shoes that meant the dolls were completely footless.

213937,"The basic essentials are covered in this package providing word processing, spreadsheets and presentations. Installation from the USB stick is a simple task.

Corel Home Office is a fine product for its price point. The applications look and operate much like their Microsoft Office [2007] counterparts and provide adequately comparable functionality  there are fewer transitions for presentations, fewer charts for spreadsheets, less complex word processing features, a slightly less streamlined and featurefilled interface. Core features and tools are included; most of what is lacking would be missed primarily by the power user.

It is a fine product for smallscale business or for anyone unwilling to she will out big bucks for productivity software  not a bad choice for students on a budget.

Transitioning to and from a larger suite is easy enough: Corel Write's ""Tools"" menu encapsulates some of the tools you find on Word's ""Mailings"" and ""Review"" tabs; the ""Insert"" menu contains trimmed down ""Reference"" tab features.  These dissimilarities are characteristic of the entire suite.

If your small business does mass mailings or if you are tackling any largescale writing projects, you might do better with a more advanced suite whose convenience features could quickly add up to countless hours of saved time.

213142,"There is a lot to like in this this small and simple suite, but it is not comprehensive nor is it compatible with any of Microsoft's products. Since Word, Outlook and Excel are enterprise standards, it is important to have a compatible office suite. With Wordperfect, this is simply not the case. Wordperfect chokes on the simplest VB scripts, is not compatible with Office tables and macros and such a foreign interface that any reasonably qualified office worker would find it a hassle. It is an XMLbased word processor, however, and this is good for writers/workers who are also capable XML programmers. I have never had a publisher, editor or evaen a college course that allows the WP format in any setting. The reveal codes is a neat gimmick but it is only helpful because formatting Wordperfect documents is so difficult to start with I am speaking as a secretary and publisher myself. If you want your office production to operate smoothly and easily for all of your workers, WordPerfect is not an option. The bottom line is that WP is not easy compatible, or as thorough as any version of Microsoft Office. If you care about compatibility and your company's bottom line, spend an extra $50 and get the suite from Microsoft.

On the other hand, if you have no need for compatibility or efficient production, get Wordperfect, it is smooth, goodlooking and is wellsupported by Corel who continue to improve as a company owned by Microsoft.",great suite but incompatible with business apps.

156026,"The story was not too confusing at first, and the game controls are easy to manipulate. The graphics are fairly good although I have seen better.

The save system really needs some improvement. It does not automatically save after each checkpoint is reached, it saves at what appears to be random checkpoints or major checkpoints. In addition, version 1.0 is extremely buggy with many crashes to the desktop during cutscenes. The PhysX patch brings it to 1.1 and it appears to be far more stable.

The graphics are very good  typical CapCom grade which is above average for the industry, but the voice acting and plot is not the best.

54252,"I think this drive is pretty awesome, but I still do not know why it has issues with my MacBook Pro. I suspect its a Mac OS issue, coupled with a hardware glitch, but I cannot trust the computer to not crash when it goes to sleep with the computer closed. At least not with the SSD inside. Never had the problem with an HHD.

So now I shut down anytime I want to close the computer up for a while, unless I know Ill be back within a few hours. Fortunately this SSD is really really fast, so boot times are consistently below 15 seconds, and often closer to 12 seconds.

So if you want to speed up your computer, consider that your old mechanical drive is probably what is holding you back and get one of these. Its a great product. I Have used mine for over a year and have not had a failure, plus I have two that I put in enclosures USB3 and thunderbolt to have really fast external drives. My externals are faster than an internal HDD. One caveat: make sure you have the latest fast bus speed to take advantage of the SSD performance. If you have a slow bus, it does matter how fast you pedal.","A great, fast drive"

185038,"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",Does what it needs to

Origami was always a project that I never thought I could get a grasp on, even though I always admire the pieces I find at museums or even at craft shows. Like, my brain understands its just paper and folding, but my hands never catch on!

What I really liked about this set is I have a choice of 10 colors in the same pack, plus step by step visual instructions! And that seemed to be the ticket, instead of just reading the words or following only pictures with no explanation. It took a few tries to get the hang of it, but now my office and mantle are filled with various pieces of art.

I enjoyed how the paper folded for the different pieces we were making. It held its shape very well but did not tear like some other kinds we have tried in the past. And the nice thing about the eBook that comes with the paper is you can start right away since no other supplies are required.

112659,"This is not one of Bogey's better known movies nor is it one of his best but this movie does have a certain charm. First of all, it is basically a comedy  that makes it an unusual vehicle for Bogey. He does have the ability to pull it off though it is not his forte. The film takes place during WWII; Bogey is a bit of a shady character attempting to stop the saboteurs of the Third Reich operating in the YOU.S.A. The movie has its dramatic moments but it is really plain old entertainment. Phil Silvers has a small role, Jackie Gleason has a smaller one. There are not any bonus features, however, but the DVD quality is excellent. Enjoy Bogey in a different type of movie, there is a chance you might realize he could do other things other than being a tough guy.",All the Through the Night

There are three modes in which the light will work, high, low and flashing.  It puts off a nice blueish light due to the silicone part of the lamp.  Oh but the silicone is hollow so you can store things in it.  Yep you can keep things you might need to keep dry in it and it will keep them safe from water or anything else that might harm them. The handle can be removed on one side if you need to do that.  And as I said earlier the silicone is soft so it can actually be folded into a more compact size for storage.  Over all this is a really nice multipurpose lantern that can be used for pretty much anything you might need a light and storage for.

Cry, which the title suggests is a counterpart to Scream, is actually the new Man In The Mirror; a fact you might not recognize until the end. Change the world, is the final message. Back then it was, Make that change.

Aesthetically both philanthropy anthems are about the same, but the message sounded more urgent in 1987. The melodies are well composed and the adlibs during the final minute near classic Michael Jackson, but, despite backup from a full gospel choir, he sounds less energetic, ironically less Invincible, here.

I have to say that while not ""top end"" its anything but ""Cheap, garbage"" that you will not know if it will even last a day of use.  I have a few RCA devices hooked up into a switch multi in and one out where the out of THAT adapter goes to the RCA inputs of this unit.... I have had NO problem on any device and to be 100 honest ... the picture quality is BETTER then when I had RCA connectors directly into the RCA connectors of my TV the picture was darker than it should have been and not as sharp as it is now.... eventually the RCA connectors ON THE tv ""went bad"" and while I am sure I could get the skills to fix it ... this Adapter allows me not to have to worry about fixing it for now

The one issue is that ""switch"" inside the unit that changes from say your TV tuner to the RCA device when that device is turned on ... It is just my personal opinion but I would rather have an 'on/off"" switch for this or an ""RCA/Coax"" switch on the side but that is not to say the automatic switcher is not working, so far It has been NO PROBLEM

119711,"I got my first Shubb capo when playing a gig. A previous touring band had left it behind and was not coming back. Score.

If you plan to perform and care about staying in tune, buy this capo.

It adjusts so you can get the right tension wherever placed on whatever neck. On my acoustic I loosen it a few turns capoing at 8, tighten up a bit capoing at one. Easy and fast, can do it between songs no problem.

It applies even, straight down tension all at once, not a ""pinch"" like the Keyser style does. Yes, you should still check your tuning, your guitar setup/intonation would have to be flawless to not need to, but you will have about 1 of the tuning issues with a Shubb that you would have with a Keyser.

Okay  I get it. The Keyser clips onto your headstock so easy. If you want to pass a guitar around a campfire and make noise, use your Keyser. If you want to play guitar, buy one of these or something of a similar design.  Yes, you are going to lose it. And then you are going to buy another one. And it will be worth it. And maybe somebody else will find your other one and they will sound better. Everybody wins.","Best in class, industry standard"

I bought the fingerless version of these gloves and after a couple months of wearing them 90 minutes daily with no issues, I bought these to complement them.  Even in 100degree heat they are not uncomfortable.  The mesh on the back does its job on that score.

About fitment:  I have found after two purchases the sizing formula for me is to use the size chart provided by the manufacturer and go one size up from what the measurements tell me.  I usually wear a 2XL bicycle glove and I only wear an XL from this manufacturer using the above method.  In my case the XLs are possibly the best glove fit ever in terms of proper finger length, palm size... everything.  Very pleased.  I will be socking away an extra pair to make sure I have them after I wear these out.

I do a lot of daily riding and I go through gloves quick.  Its really nice to find a quality product that costs so little compared to some of the big brand names that have come apart on me after a couple of months of daily rides.",In my case the XLs are possibly the best glove fit ever in terms of proper finger length

124585,"I only issued a three star rating to raise a caution flag with this harp.  It is not a typical diatonic harp, and if you are expecting it to sound and perform like one, you will be disappointed.

It is a fine, wellmade partiallyvalved harmonica, and if you desire to experiment with a valved harp, the Promaster Valved Harp is a fine choice.  But, to reiterate, if you like the sound of standard diatonic harp and want a harmonica that will perform like one, this is not the harmonica you are looking for.  It can be harsh and unpredictable in tone and its reeds can sometimes buzz, blurt, or honk abruptly.  I am an experienced harp player and perform regularly. And I have no doubt an experienced player could have some fun with this instrument.  And If you are interested in this harp as a musical experiment, go for it.  But, if you want a good diatonic harp that will play and perform as you expect one to, this harmonica will be a squawky, quirky disappointment.  Order the regular Promaster or Crossover, or Special 20, or Bluesmaster, or Olive, or, to save some money, a Big River.","Caution.  A fine harp, but not a conventional one."

184149,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

So when we needed a good book to read aloud in the spring, my husband and I began Our Mutual Friend.  What a treat!  I am amazed by any novelist's ability to create an array of characters and circumstances and then weave them all together in surprising ways.  Dickens not only  does this with great skill; he is also a caustic satirist of great humor, an absolute genius of character study, and a spirited social critic to boot.  When the wicked finally get their comeuppance, those who apply the verbal medicine do so with an articulate fervor that is deeply satisfying. Not always an easy read, this book is definitely worth the effort.",What a treat!

$120.00 is a hefty price to pay for such a set. You get:
1 Shaving brush super soft
2 Preshave oil the size of about 1/3 of a cup
3 Shaving cream about a cup
4 Aftershave balm 1/2 a cup
I estimate, if you use these products every day, the set will probably last you about 2 months, especially shaving cream which fills up the biggest just but is very fluffly and light and will surely be used up very quickly.

Granted, all these products of a great quality. My husband loves the feel of his soft and smooth skin after his shaves. The scent lavender is very sophisticated, light and soothing no AXE and Old Spicelike fragrance overload hear. He overall enjoys the whole shaving experience, even though it does take extra time over his usual routine.

173599,"At some point, whether we like it or not we are going to run into a conflict of one form or another with a coworker and because I Have always been interested in psychology and the sources of conflict, not to mention having a desire to understand conflict and how to resolve it on amicable terms regardless of the situation. I decided to do a little research into conflict resolution and see what I could come up with so that I could add these skills to my psychological and social interaction toolbox should a conflict ever arise in my workplace between myself and a coworker. I stumbled across this book while serving through the Kindle section of Amazons website and I Am glad I chose to download it. This book does an excellent job of explaining the sources and/or reasons as to why conflicts can and do occur in the workplace between two or more coworkers. It does a solid job of explaining the definition of conflict as well as offering skills in understanding and empathy for the other person when it comes to resolving conflicts by the time you finish the book, you will have a solid understanding and the tools necessary to understand conflict and hopefully bring your workplace conflict to an amicable solution between yourself and your coworkers.

26720,"These are very pretty brushes.  The handles are much prettier than pictured the wood has a nice grain and has been well stained and polished.  They are not that thick these are fairly thin handled. They are 11 inches long, including the filbert.
The filbert is copper per the ad, but I cannot test that  they appear to be nickel, or nickel plated, so please note that if you have allergies.  They are double crimped.

The bristles are well crimped and the entire brush is tight. They have a good bit of bounce, and maintain a good point when wet with oils.  I did not test them with water colors as I paint in oil  acrylics mainly.  They have a fair bit of bounce and are easy to control.
I am not sure what the mix is, it appears to be natural though.  I do not see any synthetic fibers in the brushes that I received.  Not that it matters to me, today's synthetics are just fine to me.  These are nice brushes in this price range.  Just one of this quality would cost more than 7.99 at my local art supply store.

37680,"Lifehouse went a totally different direction on this album, away from the pop oriented sound on their debut album, and onto a more mature, dynamic sound.  My first few listens were judgmental, and I did not give the album a fair chance to shine, because I was expecting more poppy hooks and rhythms.  After I let that out of my head, I listened to some pretty excellent music.
Without a doubt, the two best songs on the album are ""How Long"" and ""The Beginning"", two of the last songs on the album.  They show maturity as a band, and there is a Pink Floyd kind of feel to them, as the songs make you drift off and you feel like everything will be OK upon listening, and shortly thereafter.
""Just Another Name"", ""Anchor"", and ""Am I ever Going To Find out"" are other stand out tracks, and sort of have a pop sound to them, with catchy hooks.
Jason Wade is a brilliant writer, and has a unique voice.  I look forward to Lifehouse's future work, as they are on the verge of putting out a masterpiece with their current evolution.",Taking a different direction....

What works so well with this novel is the psychotic breakdown of events as told by the narrator. The way he mesmerizes the reader with his illogical psychopathy    one simply cannot believe that he is going to do what he does; and this is the essence of the story, that he just keeps going one step further into dreaded villanous territory; every description including the weather notations, almost seem to advance like blankets of ice hell bent on covering every crime he commits. I kept waiting for him to slip up and really get it; but he does not, and that is the gristle of the novel.

110515,"""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is nothing more than a bythenumbers film created with liberal use of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Directing the Medeival Epic."" I have been vastly entertained by director Luc Besson's work in the past, but this film is a plodding, goredrenched nod toward Mel Gibson's vastly superior ""Braveheart."" ""The Messenger"" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. ""The Messenger"" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic and more convincing. Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holierthanthou manner. The film's topics are interesting was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?, but the execution is poor. On top of this, the scripting and dialogue is just plain bad. If you want an epic, I suggest looking elsewhere. Maybe somebody out there will make a better picture about this fascinating historic figure.",An Uninspired Epic...

""NIST Traceable thermometers"" include a certificate of calibration; which from what I have seen have an accuracy of 1 degree centigrade compared to / 4 degrees or more for others.

Control3 company is an NIST standard manufacturer who rebrands its products for other companies.  They have a page of distributors on their site; unfortunately, none appear on Amazon.

Regarding the AcuRite product, my wife bought this model about a year ago.  It worked well until the battery needed to be changed.

One of the ""suckers"" had come loose from the window.  After changing the battery, I cleaned the suckers and the window with alcohol, then put the thing up.  The suckers were noticeably flattened from the time spent in the shade on a north window, out of direct sunlight, but it seemed to stay in place.

A few hours later, I happened to notice it was missing.  Went outside and found that it had fallen on some rocks,  broken and unusable.

Until its demise, it worked well.  Or seemed to.  It was always at variance with the local weather stations by as much as ten degrees.  There is several factors that can account for these differences, but I wanted something a little more trustworthy, short of a thousand dollar setup.

Spent several hours looking at critiques on Amazon, did not like anything.  Found a product elsewhere with the same display for about $10 more that not only is certified, but uses a velcro attachment for the window.",Look for Certification...
19154,"I think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard.  I am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter, but going to give it a try.  I love the thickness of this cover creme, it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles.  If you do not like thick heavy concealer, this is not for you.  If you need a highly pigmented, heavy concealer, I recommend you try this one.  I am very happy with it, but I might need to try another shade.

15829,"This Vichy shaving gel is the thickest, creamiest shaving cream I have ever used and yet it rinses off the blade with ease. In the past, when I have used thicker shaving gels, the tradeoff is always that the cream is so thick that I have to spend a lot of time rinsing the blade between strokes. This cream somehow dissolves immediately when you get the blade wet.

I have been using this with Gillette Fusion 5 blades and am very happy with the results. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any rashes or irritations with this product. The smell is mild but fresh.

One piece of advice: a little bit goes a long way. You can probably do your whole face by starting with a nickelsized dollop. So make sure not to spray too much because it keeps expanding as you put it on your face! And given the high price, it is good that a little goes a long way!","very creamy, nice smell"

46055,"This is the Ray I like bestthe RB chart topper of the mid 50'sWhen he belonged only to Black America. Great mid 50's top 10's like ""I have got a woman"", ""Comeback"", one of my personal faves ""A fool for you"", ""Drown in my own tears"", ""Greenbacks"", and ""What I would say"" were all big sellers in every African American community and on every juke box from Harlem to Miami to LA to Kansas City. His vocal styling incorporates the sound of Charles Brown and Percy Mayfield with a whole lot of Ray thrown in for thickener. This is the Ray that only Black America knew at the time which does not make these songs any less powerful but instead full of rich substance. ""A fool for you"" is one of the all time great RB singles of that wonderful decade called the 50's. Another priceless piece of Rock n Soul history. It was not watered down top 40 pop radio material but that is why this stuff is so addictive to listen to. By the way if you want to hear soul music being single handedly invented listen to 1955's ""Comeback"" and ""A fool for you"". This was not the sound of RB in 1955 and these songs predated James and The Flames 1956 classic ""Please,Please,Please. In fact ""Comeback"" and ""A fool for you"" could have easily been released in 1965 and neither song would have stood out like a sore thumb right smack dab in the middle of the soul music explosion.

211862,"""Message"" is the first Nancy Drew Pc game that I have tried and I was very favorably impressed. The game is literate: it is not directed towards very young players per se and young people will have to read well to appreciate the many tidbits of literature scattered around the Victorian mansion. I am 76 and could read them quite well. Happy face or smiley

The sets are beautifully rendered in elegant color and the Chinese antiques are a feast for the eye. The characters are well animated with gestures that are completely natural. The voices are good, too.

""Message"" is Nirvana for the Point and Click enthusiasts. No expert mouse maneuvers are required such as jumping into a fast moving bucket in ""Uru."" Nothing is timed. We take our PC games very seriously and it is an affront to the ego when one is not fast enough to perform an intricate mouse gyration. In fact, I could get stage fright just looking at a high ledge I knew I had to vault upon and therefore could not perforn at all.

""Message"" is scary. This is by no means a plain dish of vanilla. There are creaks and groans and shadowy forms passing in the night. Atmosphere plus. And you can wander around just as you wish poking into this and that and getting a delicious scary thrill when a curtain suddenly billows into your face with hissing sound.

Captions are provided which are very helpful as the characters speak rapidly. All in all ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" is a very solid piece of work for all ages.",You are never too old to go sleuthing!

Two things.

1. It has TRS jack the 3rd contact is used for charging, Depending on the type of socket used in your guitar, it may not work. Guitar may ""expect"" ground where the charging contact is positioned.
For example, it does not work with PRS piezzon equipped models I have P22, piezzon output works with this, but main out ""MAG/MIX"" just does not. Google your guitar model before buying.

2. It uses 2.4 GHz to transmit signal. I assume it just uses WiFi. And if you have your WiFi router close to G10, it does not work. They mention it in the manual it should be 3 meters apart, but who reads manual before buying, right? For most of the people it may be Ok, but if you have WiFi router next to where you plan to use G10 like I did, do not buy.",Does not work with every guitars

Since I never needed to buy a mailbox before, I came to Amazon to shop. We wanted something big, something that could receive packages and not just letters. And we wanted something more than a mailboxonapost.

Well this is it! It does everything we need, and it has some style too. It sits on top of a 4x4 inch wood post which is secured in the ground. That was the hardest part of the installation  getting the 4x4 wood post installed and straight! Assembly was easy. No, there were not any predrilled holes. But there were dimples in the plastic that make starting the selftapping screws really easy!

161465,"Parents magazine is a very good publication about raising kids to be happy, healthy adults. It offers some good advice about the task of parenthood, illustrating the hard work and rewards that go hand in hand if parents perform their role in the best possible manner.

I like this magazine as a whole, but there are a few things that potential readers need to know about before they pick up a copy to read. First of all, the articles in Parents magazine deal mostly with younger children, below twelve years of age. You will not find much of value in this magazine if you have teenagers. It is intended more for families with youngsters.

Another thing about this magazine that makes it less practical than it otherwise would be is the suggestions for family activities. The ideas presented here are all pretty good, but the problem is that the majority of them involve outlays of cash and/or time that are unrealistic for most families. I can agree, for example, that adding a game room would make a nice addition to one's house and would add tremendously to a family's time spent together. But how many among us can afford a home addition? Parents magazine talks about activities and enhancements like this in an unrealistic way, making them seem much simpler and easier to implement than they really are.

Aside from distractions like that, however, Parents is a very good magazine to read. It is one of the longest magazines you can buy, with 200 to 300 pages per issue. Add to that the low subscription price, a few pages of coupons, and the generally sound parental advice and you have all the makings of a good magazine for young families.",Raising Kids in the Modern World

153763,"This is coming from the perspective of a longtime fan of FFIV.  This has been my favorite game of all time since I first played it, I think in 1993.  I have played all the remakes.  I am not going to be too longwinded here, most people playing this game and reading the review have probably played it before in earlier incarnations.  This is a good remake, but for me, not perfect.  My main complaints:

 The translation, while for the most part is very good, differs from the original in a few places for the worse.  Specifically, a key confrontation about halfway through the game lost much of its impact for me due to the translation change.
 The music lags.  When something happens in game, it takes 12 seconds of disc access before the accompanying music starts.  In some cases this really reduces the impact of the moment.  For example, when a character joins your party, you get the text notification, then 2 seconds later the exciting music plays, woo!  Sometimes the music is cutoff before it ends because of this lag issue.
 I wish they had not changed many of the magic animations.  I thought Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga animations from the original were awesome.  The new ones are cool, but why change it?

These are pretty minor issues.  In many ways, the game is very archaic.  Most people that play this will do it for the nostalgia, and for that reason it does not disappoint.  The graphical overhaul was nice, though not a vast improvement over the original.  Definitely worth $30 for fans of the original, especially if they did not get to play After Years on the Wii.","Solid, but not perfect"
248243,"I bought this for $15.99.  For that price, I think this is a great first microscope for kids.  My neighbor's dog had a birthday party last week not kidding and 25 people came.  Their ages ranged from 175 years old.  My four year olds brought their microscope to entertain their friends there.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone tried out the microscope, from the one year old to the 75 year old.  I even use it in our house; we have three cats and carpet, and I am often wondering what are the little things embedded in our rug.  Now I just put stuff under the microscope to check it out.  The price seems to fluctuate quite a bit, but for $15.99 it was worth it.",Fun for people from age 1-75!!

While I have used nylock nuts on quite a few items where I do not want the nut coming off,  like on some kind of a pivoting joint one of the main reasons for ordering knurled nuts to begin with is because they are tightened and removed frequently. A nylon bushing does not make sense here, and to me is just a bad design. Not sure what they were thinking.

I just took 0.25 x 20 tap that I happen to have, and got rid of the nylon, but it takes a while, and something I did not anticipate having to do.

229432,I bought a 1/4 drive set 2030 attachments. When I opened the case everything looked appropriate but when I took the ratchet out and tried to use it it was a complete joke. It would not turn in either direction without immense pressure being applied. I then attempted to oil it to reduce the obvious friction withlin the mechanism. Uppn loosing the two allen screws that hold the head together 3  springs and 2very small ball bearings flew out all over the place.  I have never seen anything with that much torque pressure on it.  Since I needed the remaining part of the set I purchased another 1/4 inch ratchet. I plan on returning the unit with all its pieces to Amazon and ask for a replacement for this one.  My Cresent set works just fine and I will buy another one if Stanley/Amazon does not replace this unit.,NEVER HAVE I SEEN A TOOL WITH THIS MANY PROBLEMS BUILT INTO IT.

153978,"This game was literally the first time I actually started to become emotional in playing a video game. The storytelling is absolutely brilliant  the conclusion so well done and wondrous, it clearly outshines anything a live action movie could ever hope to do.

The game's pacing and character development allow you to empathize with all of the characters, particularly Yuna and Tidus. All the characters are brilliantly woven and serve their purpose.

However, the endless battles can get annoying, along with the constant item hunting/searching.

Pros:

Excellent graphics

The good old story from Meta Gear Solid, and the Graphics and gameplay from Metal Gear Solid 2 SOL

Some boss battles are easier from the PSX version, like Sniper Wolf

For Nentendo fans who waited for Snake to return to Nentendo, it could not have came in a better way

Cons:

Longer cinamatics, which I really do not care for

The voice acting is not as good as the PSX version

The Gun sound effects are not as good as the PSX version

the music is not as good as the PSX version

nothing added on to the game

Well despite the cons, this game in so many ways is a crazy revamping of the PSX version.  I just wish it sounded the same.  Those who have a gamecube, and never played Metal Gear Solid should definitly play this eye candy revamped version.  To those who have played Metal Gear Solid, as long as your not expecting alot of new stuff, this is a nice buy.

163652,"This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !. The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.
On the bright side, there are many nice deacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.
Taking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.
There are numerous articles on remodeling, ""Foolproof Potted Plants"", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.
The best article of all, is ""The Magic of Soup"", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.
As someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.
All things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.",cluttered but nice

I guess it is that I do not like the look of bronzer,  I prefer just blush.  What a waste of cash!  I wanted something that would sculpt my cheekbones and give me a nude look.  But it is as orange as can be and makes me look way too made up.  Now I have a somewhat expensive makeup item that I cannot do a thing with.

10238,"My wife used this as directed and is seeing probably 50 hair growth reduction after 4 applications using the medium level there are 3 intensity levels.

Personally I am indifferent but I know people do not like shaving because I do not enjoy shaving. For those wanting permanent reduction of hair growth, this is an effective tool. I believe the price is fair because one can spend a little less and get a lot less in such a product.

Here is why this is a good solution:
 It is faster than older and cheaper models, meaning the pulses are coming quickly  especially if glided over the legs and it senses stubble use after shaving.
 Uses both light and radio waves, and bears the FDA certificate that it is clinically proven to work.
 The options to use three levels allow for testing before building to a higher intensity level.
 The actual area that is getting treated is larger than those of smaller and cheaper units. The metal bars on each end of the part that touches the skin being treated, when in contact with the skin produce pulses. The pulses on this unit cover more area than other units I have seen, hence less time and effort needed.

As I said, the results are plain to see after only 4 sessions and the effort was minimal. Also, there was no pain or irritation  per my wife.",Can't argue with visible results

14922,"I really like this fragrance. It is relatively muted and I feel that it leaves a rich aroma. Kind of interesting that some reviews comment on the longevity of the product. Understand that this product is a Eau de Toilette. Eau de Toilette sprays are 515 and last typically for about 3 hours. A perfume is 1520 and can last for 58 hours, so know what you are buying and how long you want your fragrance to last.

The bottle itself has a nice black leather wrap. The spritz is not a huge blast, which I have found to be an issue in some sprayer bottles. You will not be overpowered with one shot. I typically spray into the air and walk into the spritz so it is not too much. Do this in my undershirt, mainly aiming for the base of the neck and chest area. This allows products to combine with your natural pheromones, producing a unique scent which is only you. A dab under your ears is great when your date is leaning in close to you. If you have dry skin, you can use a bit more since your skin absorbs more of the product.

I will just say that I like the scent, colognes smell differently on everyone for the reason I mentioned above. So it is not much point getting too much into the layers of the product which the manufacturer has already laid out.",Masculine and woodsy

44388,"Okay, here is how the marketing mentality works. Take an already released album, add new tracks and the fans, even the ones who bought the original, will rush out and buy it. Right? Absolutely.  Sure, there will be those who will be mad as hell. Why are we being treated this way? We are being cheated!

I suppose there may be a slight argument for that sort of thinking, but not, in my opinion, where Blake Shelton's MORE PURE BS is concerned. His hit, ""Home,"" is, all by itself, well worth the extra money and even the addition of what seems a duplicate album to my collection. ""Home"" is quite easily the finest song that Shelton has recorded and the other two new tracks, ""Chances"" and ""I Cannot Walk Away,"" are wonderful additions to the excellent tracks on the original PURE BS album.

Besides, if you are really bent about the prospect of having to buy the new album, simply download the new tracks from Amazon for a nominal fee, add them to the original album and have a great listening experience.

With PURE BS and the new MORE PURE BS, Shelton truly emerges as a bona fide Country star and I will expect a lot more great stuff from him in the future.

I decided to spend the money on this device to help me determine what was happening.  By measuring the temperature at different air registers I was able to see that the unit, in fact, was not performing well.  Since it was over 17 years old the decision was made to replace it.  Again, I was able to measure the performance of the new system.  Average temperature was 10 degrees lower at each register with the new unit.  That made the cost of the thermometer well justified.  I am sure I can find other things to measure that may expose opportunities to save money on heating or cooling.  Easy to use and seems acceptably accurate.

His name is Ronsardhe is one of my favorite characters and he has an extremely important message for his Queen Alinea. Ronsard asks if anyone could go and give the message for him. Quentin agrees to go but he can no longer return to the temple. The knight tells him to go to a hermit named Durwin and to give the message without stopping. So, mounted on Ronsard's horse Balder, Quentin rides to Durwin's house. He meets Durwin and also Durwin's friend, Theido. Theido and Quentin rides to Askelon where the Queen was, but they are caught by the crafty coward, Prince Jaspin. The Prince is the King's brother and he wants to have the crown. Quentin escapes and goes to the Queen. The message he gave was that King Eskevar had been captured by the evil necromancer, Nimrood. Then, the Queen, Durwin, and Quentin meets Theido. He had escaped and together they ride to save the King. Quentin learns of a new God, the Most High and he turns away from Ariel and the other gods to worship the true one God. Durwin teaches him more about God on the way.
Can they rescue the King from Nimrood? Can they win the battle with Prince Jaspin's 100,000 men with their 10,000?

65243,"A fascinating discovery for a European: there is a black upper class in America  in the book they are sometimes called ""The Gold Coast"". But they still feel marginalized, full of rage and suspicion, isolated within their professional communities.
They distrust the liberals, but for historical reasons cannot trust the conservatives  or those among them who convert to the conservative because. The father of the narrator  a ClarenceThomaslike judge  did and was subsequently embroiled in a confirmation battle that destroyed his reputation and his family.
His death means trouble for his son; a lot of people want to know about the ""arrangements"" of the dead judge. They are a riddle  a chess problem with a hidden message  and they mean trouble. As if the hero had not enough of that already: with his ambitious but unfaithful wife, at his university, with his family history and his life in general.
The story is fascinating as a glimpse into life on the Gold Coast, but it rather fails as a mystery. The narrator cheats, because he discovers something, acts and then tells the reader two or three chapters later what and when he found out. Besides: the plot is either too arcane  the big conspiracy that involves them all: liberals and conservatives  or too obvious and sometimes facilitating between those extremes
Still: this is a book to be recommended.","Great story, so-so mystery"

215844,"Did my homework on these networkthroughyourhouseholdwiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either onestar or fivestar ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do  six easy steps  and everything worked perfectly.  I did not have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.

The cuts came out beautifully and the joints are excellent.

There was an added bonus in that this is a full kerf blade and the cut is exactly 1/8"". This made it very easy to calculate the key spacings and to account for the cut when I finally sliced the top off the box.

72234,"This is a wellwritten book concerning a subgenre of women in the late 18th to early 20th centuries: the courtesans, or women who used their sexual allure to attract men to give them financial backing for their extravagent lifestyles. It is a fascinating glimpse into another type of life, and what amazed me is the avidity with which the careers of these women were followed by the majority of people of the time. In an age that did not boast supermarket tabloids, the ""respectable"" newspapers ocasionally had articles about these women and their exploits. There was, to be truthful, a double standard operating here: a woman courtesan was not necessarily welcome everywhere in ""polite society"", but a man who dallied openly outside of his marriage vows had no such shunning problem. Have we advanced more in our supposedly ""enlightened"" days? I guess so, but it is not much of a gain for us, I believe.

210005,"Photo Director 4 is a good product for people starting to use photo editing software. It is easy to use. Handling multiple photos and organizing them is easy. Plus, there are many special effects that make photo editing fun.

However, the program is not much better than many others on the market for less money. The program handles only JPEG, TIFF and RAW formats. While these are the ones most frequently used by amateur photographers, it is not satisfactory for a professional, or semiprofessional who also uses GIF and BMP. While not a major disadvantage, it is a limitation.

The program has several presets for enhancement of photos and more are available online. However, I found that they are usually too extreme for my photos, so I do not use them. Still, it is a major advantage to get additional enhancements on line.

This program is good for people just starting to use photo editing software but to be honest, there are cheaper alternatives available, some of them free. I use both Photo Director 4 and Power Director 11. The slideshow alternatives on Power Director are truly astonishing. I would like to see something like that on Photo Director. It would be a much more interesting product.",Good for Beginners

19166,"I Have used primers in the past and have never seen much of an improvement.  Even with Clinique and Elizabeth Arden primers my makeup seams to evaporate from my face within a few hours.  But I have found that this Bliss primer actually does something.  When I use the Bliss primer I find that I still have makeup on my face when I get home from work about 12 hours after application.  My face gets very oily, and I find that the Bliss also holds down the shine amazingly well.  The Bliss keeps my makeup looking matte and uniform all day.

So 5 stars for the primer itself, but I do not like the sunscreen component as much.  The cream has a very white, opaque look that gives my skin a ghostly appearance.  Once I put the makeup on my color is fine, but this Primer is not something you could use without applying a serious amount of foundation on top of it.  The dispenser design is another big miss.  When I first opened the box I found that half the contents had leaked out.  Primer covered the inside of the box and the cap.  The dispenser has a twisting top that let us you turn the dispenser On or Off, but regardless of how I have it set, primer will come out if the bottle is squeezed.

I do like this primer so I probably buy it again, but I wish they would rethink the design of the dispenser.","The primer keeps my foundation looking fresh for hours, but the design of dispenser is a big miss"

160490,"I found this game to be quite fun. However it does fall short on a few points. The description does not exactly portray the gameplay and the controls can be difficult to get used to you. Once you get the controls worked out the game becomes more fun to play.

The problem with this openworld game style is there looks to be many different missions/styles, however after a while you realize they are all closely related. Most missions have you killing, hacking, running. I was hoping for a bit more variety, but it does have a leg up on the GTA series which i have played since the topdown views era.

My main takeaway from playing this game is this... just play it your own way. Yes the missions can be linear, but the world has a lot to explore. I can see this game occupying a good amount of playtime. Some gamers are comparing the shooting to Call of Duty, but that just does not make any sense. This game is most similar to the GTA franchise, if anything.","Great game, something different"

4552,"This was somewhat smaller than I expected it to be, but that is my fault as each size does come with measurements.  The fabric is this slick nylon/canvas type material that, while tough, is not very soft and is prone to some serious static electricity even after it was washed and dried with fabric softener.  I really like the memory foam quality, as it is not too soft, but still squishy enough that my dog enjoys it.  My dog is a 70 lb black lab mix who measures almost three feet long from the back of her head to her tail notch.  She DOES sleep curled up, so the bed works for her for the most part, but we had to supplement with a body pillow for her to be truly comfortable.  I have included photos to show how the bed looks.  We have put a plush blanket on the bed since then.  While I did mention that it was smaller than I expected, it does fit in the space I had to put it in, and my dog DOES use it and seems fairly happy with it.  Also, you can remove all the padding including in the tube in the top, as well as the memory foam. It comes with an extra protector to go around the memory foam mattress, which i thought was genius.  It is a well made bed, but I really wish they would chosen a softer, less staticy fabric which is why I marked it down from five to four stars.

2/9/16 Update:  The company emailed me letting me know that they were looking at different fabrics for their beds, as I am not the only one who would prefer something a bit less slick.","Really well made and thought out bed, but slightly smaller than I thought it would be, and very slick fabric."

This review is just for ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.""

Two legendary monsters meeting for the first time, in the main event of the 20th century, which may be a tad disappointing in decades of retrospect, but then again, I have thrilled time  time again to this battle!

What really saves this film is the great ensemble acting, a very good story line, sharp direction,  of course, Frankenstein's monster  the Wolfman! The showdown of two of the most legendary, iconic monsters of all time!

Worth the price of admission for this film alone!",The Ali vs. Frazier Monster Movie of All Time!

A Quick Look........
Watch Blue Ray or DVD in amazing quality.
Watch Movies directly from You Tube or Facebook
Plays 3D  movies
Has a music store with impressive features including the ability to store your purchased music online.
Will scan your computer for all media and catalog it for you.
Super remote control ""App"" for most smartphones

This is a very well thought out media player, I use it to watch DVD's on my laptop, or our projector which hooks up via HDMI and though not Hi Definition, looks very good on this player. It also will scan your hard drive if you so wish and catalog your media files. It also offers the ability to watch videos directly from You Tube or Facebook and they also look really good! The player is 3D ready, but I am not, however I plan to be within a year so the fact that I am ready for it is a big plus. My guess is that 3D TV's and BluRay players will be the norm within 2 yearsmaybe even streaming outlets too
This  program just goes way beyond what I expected and has really impressed me.
This is a really must have media player even if you do not use all of the features, or are like me, not ready for some.........",Amazing Software

124815,"This is a sturdy stand, adjusts to comfortable height for sitting or standing. Great once it is set up, portable with its own bag, and at a good price. Holds my trumpet mute holder great.

It is a little on the heavy side, but that goes with being sturdy. I suppose 3/4"" perforations could make it lighter without weakening it, but that is labor and adds cost. Minor complaint.

The bag is strong, and the stand just barely fits. So it works fine, just takes a little bit of fiddling to get it in and zipped. Minor complaint.

The main shaft collar that opens and closes the legs has a tendency to bind. Again, a little fiddling and the legs open and close ok. Minor complaint. Maybe it will loosen up over time, hope it does not loosen up to the point where it will not stay set.

visually you cannot see anything in the game, the sky is orange and the town is like always black
weird set up, its in the setup as a first person shooter but with no guns or melee objects, its like the elder scrolls in the set up, but for this game it just does not work
pointless game, you just go into places and take things, and the story line is completely confusing and has no point
multiplayer is terrible
i pre ordered this game and i got the dlc pack with the bank robbery, did not even work
i paid 60$ for this game and i was so ampt when i got it but when i started to play it i relized i would have rather thrown my money in the garbage, only get this game if its priced at 0.01$

If you are looking for an ocean/water inspired polish, especially for a pedicure for the beach, this is perfect.

Application wise, it is consistent with the great user experience I have come to expect from Zoya.  It is easy to apply evenly and does not go on streaky.  I also find this to be pretty pigmented, so for me 2 thin coats has been perfect to get a more opaque look.

It also has great longevity.  I can go a week without chips when used with top coat on my finger nails and even longer when it is used as a pedicure.

207243,"I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money.
I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150.
Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for nonmicrosoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though.
Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC.
I have developed one caveat with this product after months of use. The Digital Rights Management system in Vista can be a real hassle for those of you that enjoy downloading music from web sites with WRM licenses. For whatever reason, Vista forgets the licenses and tells you that your player is corrupt. This only happens on legally acquired music downloads. The problem can be corrected but it is irritating since you have done nothing wrong. One problem stems from alternative players that may not be licensed to play your purchased WRM format. Say a Walmart download on a Real Player that limits you to just Windows Media Player. I found on one occassion that my audio card was shut down by Vista and that even baffled Dell. If you do not mind messing around with fixes or you do not download music from the internet, this is not an issue. It does not effect purchased CD's that are ripped on your computer or open licensed MP3's.",Not Sure Why So Many  Bad Vibes Exists

35316,"Scottish rockers The Fratellis burst onto the scene in 2006 with their debut ""Costello Music"" with its chirpy hit single ""Chelsea Dagger"" which was maddeningly catchy and heard everywhere.

The arty cover photo to ""Eyes Wide, Tongue Tied"" hints at something edgy or experimental. However, what we get are americanatinged rockers that owe a great debt to Springsteen ""Imposters Little By Little"", ""Baby Do not Lie To Me"", and the ballad ""Slow""  the latter rather nice, as well as songs that almost sound like pastiche the groovy rocker ""Thief"" strongly recalls Ray Parker Jr's ""Ghostbusters"" while ""Dogtown"" recalls The Beatles' ""Come Together"". They are not bad, just deficit in originality.

Saving the day are the epic opening number ""Me And The Devil"" with a delicate piano intro leading to a bouncy theatrical sound and Jon Fratelli singing lines like ""I am going to sell this soul of mine"", the mellow and melodic ""Desperate Guy"", the bluesy ""Getting Surreal"", and the ballad ""Moonshine"" with a world wearysounding performance.

This needed to keep oils, dirt, etc. from the face off the compacted powder. This truly is great design!

When it comes to the actual product, it is fairly ordinary. It is actually not that different from L'oreal or Maybelline's pressed powders/compact foundations. While this is called foundation, it is actually pressed powder and can be used likewise.

If you are considering buying this, then you presumably already know that this is no Newsweek or Time magazine.

If you are considering buying this, then chances are you are looking for a light read filled with items from popular culture.  And that it is.  The glossy pages are filled with pictures of beautiful people: actors, singers, models, and reality stars.  Along with all of the sordid but secretly entertaining details of their lives.  If that is what you are looking for, you have found it.

I secretly enjoy the Who Wore It Best and Loose Talk What the Stars Said this Week features.  This is a fun magazine to read when you are looking to relax and pass a few hours, like at the beach or on an airplane.  Just do not expect to learn any real newsworthy news.

To be honest, I do not typically read this magazine because I personally find People magazine to contain better writing, a better assortment of stories, and better coverage of current events.  But we subscribe to both because my husband prefers this one for having more pictures and lighter reads.

So, if you are considering buying this, my best advice is to consider People instead.",Mindless Pleasure

69409,"There is nothing wrong with a book about people you would not necessarily want to know in real life, as long as something about them is sympathetic or you are really interested in their lives.

In Dissident Gardens, Lethem gives us two women, who are not that likable but for the fact that they are surrounded by people less likable than themselves.

In Motherless Brooklyn, Lethem made the reader feel what it was like to have Tourette's Syndrome.  His protagonist was so fresh and interesting, and his plight so sympathetic, that it did not matter that the story was a kind of silly, mediocre mystery.

Here, the action takes place largely in the area of the perceived Red Menace, and the lead characters are a Jewish communist party member and her daughter.

Maybe if you are really interested in the subject matter and era, you will not mind that the characters do not feel fresh.  I felt sometimes that I was reading someone trying to write like Junot Diaz and not quite succeeding.

Maybe next time Lethem will go back to writing like Lethem, which he does really well.",A bit too intellectual - and I like intellectual books

226794,"I have always been one of those people that just spent what seems like forever trying to handclean brushes after painting. Soap, water, rinse, repeat  over and over  and still be left with less than ideally cleaned brushes.

With the brush cleaner the teeth seporate the bristles and really clean the interior of the brush. They also allow you to scrape off the driedon surface paint on the exterior of the bristles. This makes the brushes cleaner and last longer.

The roller cover squeegee works well also, allowing you to recover much of the paint in the roller, but the main highlight here is the brush cleaning teeth.",Essentially a requirement for painting

165512,"What a helpful little cookbook this is! DELICIOUS MEALS FOR 1.22 EUROS is wellorganized into main courses, sides, and desserts. Recipes are liberally illustrated at important steps in the preparation. I am a lessthanstellar cook, and photos explaining ""The batter should now look like this"" were a great help. The recipes are easy, varied, tempting, and healthy emphasizing fresh ingredients, including fruits, veggies, fresh fish. Preparation steps are very clearly explained. Ingredient measurements are given in both grams and ounces/cups/tsps. Average prices are given in Euros, but it is quite easy to convert to dollars. Euros are currently worth about $1.35 US.

Author Kat Miller has cooked in restaurants and pubs, and she has a wonderful, common sense and very readable approach to making actually yummy food without sacrificing health and nutrition, nor breaking the budget. These are not just meals you should eat, they are meals you will want to eat. No cauliflower ""steaks"" nor batterdipped tofu in this book, thank goodness. Ms. Miller uses comfortingly recognizable foods, even when encouraging notsoadventurous cooks as I am to stretch a bit and give risotto, couscous, and gnocchi recipes a shot. At the same time, there are plenty of comfort foods: fish and chips, jacket potatoes, pizza, soups, pies and cakes among them. Little helpful hints, such a making chocolate shavings with a potato peeler, are suggested.

I should not give the impression this book is just for the novice cook, though, as it is not. Experienced and talented chefs will enjoy playing with and adapting the recipes to make their own delicious variations.","Well-organized, well-illustrated, good family meals without breaking the budget"

153158,"fun challenging game but only if you succeed. Like most the biggest thing is difficulty. It can be very rewarding to beat levels but also punishing as well. When comes to strategy like games I have always been the chess mind set, sacrifices have to be made. In Doctrine no such thing is allowed hence the difficulty. Its not that characters can easily be killed off without game strategy that bothers me its fact that get a game over if do let a single person die. While adds realism just not personal a big fan. I love demon souls, dark souls, roman total war, rottk, civilization. Point making is this is a harder game i am going to than those and can be fun but wished they add more difficulties. Nothing worse than spending more than 50 minutes in dungeon working hard only to make one small error and restart. This was a year game for me that cannot just pick it up and power through it to enjoy story.

169041,"I read the blurb and was so excited to read this modern day retelling of Jane Austen Pride and Prejudice! I went into this book with high expectations and they were all met! Lizzie makes a choice right off that bat that changes the course of her current year at school. She learns a lot about people and that her initial judgment could be off. I Loved spunky Lizzie the managing editor of the school paper who gets to the bottom of things and change happens. Dante is an amazing character and I liked how standoffish he was in the beginning. I liked getting to know him. Dante's sister Georgiana has history and Dante means well in wanting to protect her. I liked seeing how friendships change and evolve throughout the story.

The flow and plot of this story was awesome. This book does not have any lulls. I hate when a story drags. You will not find that here. My favorite part is the tree and the end of the book. This story totally rocks and is super sweet! I read this story and was left wanting more. Now off to read book two about Ellie!

Not only is the quality good, but you can also place more than one sheet of paper in the document/sheet protectors. I use these for sheet music so it is important for me to have the ability to turn the pages and have sheet music on both sides. It is also very easy putting two sheets of paper in the protector. Another positive aspect, especially using them for sheet music is they do not have a glossy or glary finish, or like some I have bought a dull finish. Just clear, easy to see through. I was able to use a 2inch binder and fill it up with 100 loaded sheet protectors. Which is 200 pages of music, plus the 100 sheet protectors. Just so you will have an idea of what type binder you might want to think of using. I bought the Amazon Basics value pack of 4, 2inch Binders.

It is truly a shame that few people use fp's any more.  They are very elegant to use and using a piston means saving a lot versus throw away cartridges.

I had to pull my old Nespresso machine out from beneath the cabinet to test this because I have switched to another brand of brewer.  But if I had truly enjoyed this coffee enough to purchase more I would have no problem placing it on the counter beside my new ""maker""

However, that was not the case. I liked Cap Mundo singlecup coffee okay, but did not love it enough to switch machines back and forth and to tackle all the extra packaging.

208036,"Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is a rather limited photo editing and retouching application compared to something like Photoshop CS or Photoshop Elements, but it does a VERY good job at simplifying several rather complex editing tasks ... making it possible for amateurs to do very difficult retouching.

For starters, many people would like to quickly remove blemishes or make themselves look thinner in photos, and PhotoDirector 5 makes it so easy to do those things I am actually surprised they are so difficult to do well in Photoshop.

The contentaware object removal tools make it easy to remove distracting objects from the backgrounds in photos, but like Photoshop and Photoshop Elements you have to be careful since the software can get confused by complex backgrounds.

In short, if you just want to quickly edit your family photos and do not want to learn more complex photo editing techniques then PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is probably the right software for you.",Quick retouching for people who are scared of Photoshop

I Loved Bull and Ian's story so much!
Bull is a tow truck driver who comes to tow Ian's car after it breaks down on the side of the road. Ian was on his way to a interview trying to get a better job than McDonalds so he could support himself better. Ian has had a horrible life with the way his mom treated him and what she did, then there were the foster homes he had been sent to. Bull loves helping people so when he meets Ian and sees were he lives he knows right away he wants to help him.
Can I just say how much I loved these two together. Between the sparks flying between these two and the steam which was off the charts hot! You could really feel how much they cared for each other from the start.
You get the angst and steam with this book which I thought was perfect! Plus you meet all of Bill's friends and family in this book which I loved!
All together I really loved this book!
I would definitely recommend this book!

As a mass produced soap it is actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula and I have some sensitive skin. Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good antiinflammatory properties.",A relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves
110498,"Good Will Hunting is basically a story that is wrapped around one big huge anti NSA message. The main character paints the NSA out to be some omnipotent, sinister organization which is out to drop bombs on harmless people in Africa. It is part of Hollywood's enormous campaign to brainwash the American people to agree with their line of thought, which is liberalism. In Hollywood land, every intelligent person is a liberal and of course the most intelligent person on the planet who is played by Matt Damon in this movie has come to the conclusion that the NSA is evil.

The NSA actually protects Americans from terrorism. It is simply an informationgathering organization and it is a vital part of our national defense. Do not let the Hollywood writers fool you. They are not as intellectually superior as they think they are. Steer clear of this film if you want to avoid being brainwashed, but I doubt if you will be able to, as it is a favorite movie for cable companies. They play it over and over and over again, like it was one of the greatest movies ever or something. They must be in on the conspiracy too.",More Liberal Bias From Hollywood

Not to get personal, but the last guy to review on Oct 15, 2010 is whistling out his sphincter.  To me his ubernegative critique smacks of someone who had preconceived notions, and never gave RoF an honest chance.  To list all his sim experience and then call this an ""arcade"" shooter is ridiculous unless of course he did not take the time to set advanced physics in game, or he likes arcade shooters....

The advanced physics models altitude pressure changes, temperature changes, wind, turbulence, the physics/lift and handling of all the different wing cross sections, etc, etc, etc.

I also suspect he does not own a system capable enough to run the sim at high settings and there is the rub, RoF really shines if you have a quad core computer and at least a 1 GB graphics card.

Please research online and read some of the other reviews for a less biased take on what is otherwise a very excellent simulation of WWI air combat.  And with every planned monthly patch it only gets better with more airplanes!  I rate it one star short of perfect 5 because it does not have a good campaign systemyet that should come out next month.

This one meets all the above criteria, and has the bonus of being USB 3.0. Read/write speeds are as fast as I need them to be. Two caveats, though:

1. The keyring loop is tiny. I had to add a metal loop because the builtin hole more like a slot, actually was too small for my cable keyring to fit through it. If I used a more conventional loop keyring, I think it would not be a problem.

2. This thing gets HOT!!!! IF you are transferring a lot of files to it, the metal acts like a heatsink, and it can get very hot.

69715,"This will be my only review for all of this ""alphabet"" series by Sue Grafton:

With acclaim for the recently released ""Z"" book of the series, I decided to try out the series with ""A"".  I am on ""F"" now after about 2 weeks, and I am enjoying them a lot.  A dedidedly talented crime/detective writer, Sue Grafton's heroine, Kinsey Millhone, first name is after her mother's maiden surname is a feisty survivor type not to be taken lightly.  She is gritty, tough, athletic, can handle a gun well enough to save her skin and then some, and is not above the occasional dip into romantic interlude.  She is got a sense of humor as well, and a philosophical disposition that is built up over each successive ""submission"" or story.  A likable gal to be sure,  she is more of a persistent character than a master of deduction and reason like, say, Sherlock Holmes for example, who invevitably stumbles onto the full discovery of her pursuits through determination and hard work armed with her detective's 'nose' that grows keener with experience.  What makes this and other tales fun to read is the adlibbing that permeates the novels, which are really just a ""thinking aloud"" kind of running commentary on whatever is confronting her at the moment, and those help to define Kinsey' personality, likes and dislikes, motivations and feelings.  I guess I am hooked now, but the cost per book was only 2.99 for ""A"" through ""E"", and now nearly $7 from here onward, so that is not so cool.",this is a general review for the series.......

213627,"I have been running this for a few months now and I have nothing but good things to say.  The interface is pretty simple, it runs scans quickly and does not seem to hog a lot of resources.  I am running on a Win 7 Pro machine with a Core i5.  Whereas with Norton, I always could tell when scan stared, with Kaspersky I only notices if I check, or I get a report at the end of a scan.

Other than a few email viruses it has not reported much.  I still have Norton on the system, and I run a few scans occasionally to see if Kaspersky has missed anything: so far nothing.

The only negative I could give is that a power user might find doing ""deep tweaks"" to be a little more frustrating, but I think the average user will be pretty happy with the streamlined interface.  Most the reputable review sites give Kaspersky high marks for detection, which is most of what I care about, followed by performance.  Overall this does everything I want.

45143,"I just received Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn yesterday and enjoyed it. It could have been a two CD set to fully appreciate the body of Loretta's work. Missing was The Pill which took Loretta's career to a whole new level. The choice of White Stripes for RatedX and Paramour for You Are not Woman Enough is interesting. I especially liked Gretchen Wilson on Do not Come home A Drinkin and Carrie Underwood on If You are Looking at Country. Reba's cut was also enjoyable as was Faith Hill on Love is the Foundation. The idea to do Coal Miner's Daughter with Loretta, Miranda Lambert and Sheryl Crow brought the album to a nice close. But I also would suggest that you compliment the album with the real classics by Loretta herself. It was errie how much Sissy Spacek sounded like Loretta in performance and vocally in the film version of Coal Miner's Daughter.
I have seen Loretta perform live twice and what an experience it was. I list this on my list of all time favorite concerts. I can see how much losing her Husband, Doo, still affects her today.

I let my chickens run free in that area. I did want some type of ground cover as they love to ""forage."" Check your city ordinance if you want fresh eggs. Where I live you can have up to 4 hens, NO rooster.

I am also using clover as a ""fill in"" between stepping stones in my ""sitting"" back yard area, fenced off from the chickens. It is short, stays green, and looks better than the grass I have in front. Since it does not get very tall it is also easier to mow. The mowing just removes the flowers.

29755,"These clasps are ingenious and they work very well. The fact that they are small and lie flat is a bonus. I would not trust them with anything heavy because the actual magnets are fairly small.

Although I like the concept, the plating on the SILVER colored ones started to wear off almost instantly  down to bronze colored metal. I have not worn any of the GOLD colored ones more than once, so I cannot speak for the plating  but they are a terrible gold tone that does not match any gold or gold colored jewelry I have. I do not know how to describe the color  maybe a brassy gold color.

I wish I could heartily recommend these clasps, but I am only able to give them 1 star because of the plating on the silver ones and the color of the gold ones. As far as function I would give them 3 stars  not 5 stars based on how small the magnets are and how I feel that other than light weight pieces of jewelry the clasps probably cannot be trusted. I have used them on several bracelets and somehow just in moving around and handling things I have had the clasps come open  because they were probably touched in just the wrong way. After that happened more than once I decided to use them only on bracelets that I would not be heart broken to lose.",INITIALLY I WAS EXCITED . . . THEN NO SO MUCH . . .

It is a fine blend of scents that also does not overpower anyone within nasal range as many fragrances, such as anything by Ed Hardy or Axe, wreak of cheap ingredients and overpowering musk that can only be described as machismo.

43090,"Like nulltvwell, I was around 10 or so when Jodeci first came out. I immediately fell in love with their revolutionary sound which mixed RB and Hip Hop flavor. This was also around the time when Mary J. Blige came out, and her style at the time was similar that is why no matter what Puffy does, I will always have a certain level of respect for his hand in creating what is now my favorite genre of music; before Jodeci/Mary J. Blige I was mainly a rap fan.

""Forever My Lady"" has got to be the best RB love song of this hip hop generation. I can still listen to it now, 12 years later, and feel the same emotions. It is my favorite song on the album, and still one of my favorite songs of all time. Following right behind are the songs, ""Come and Talk To Me,"" ""Stay,"" ""I am Still Waiting,"" and a little further down my list of favorites, ""YOU  I."" KCi and JoJo are the main vocalists on this album. I always wondered why they did not go solo since they did all the singing anyway, but I have come to understand that DeVante/Dalvin also were crucial to the sound that is Jodeci.

110311,"One of my alltime favorite movies will always be RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  Great movie, great memories seeing it when it came out in the summer of 1981, still a good movie to watch.

Then in 1984, the sequel was releaseTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  The thrill was gone.  All of the action scenes looked like models and bad special effects where was the stunt work that made the first film so exciting?.

I did not like the heroine although the director certainly did since he married her.  Someone actually counted the number of times she screamed to see if she set some kind of record Kim Basinger beat her in 1989's BATMAN.

I hated that little kid.  Even worse than I hated the little brat from the old Godzilla movies.  Just annoying.

And the story was just gross and meanspirited.  Bugs, monkey brains, human sacrifice and incineration.  Nice.

A big, induglent, ugly sequel.  A few years ago, the defunct Premiere magazine did a retrospective of these films and nearly everyone interviewed made excuses for it.  ""Well, George Lucas was going through a divorce at the time....""

I have dark hair and the powder is white so yes if you use a lot you can see it a little bit, however if you take a few min to work it in you cannot see it anymore!  It is a little pricey but for me it is well worth it, I NEVERRRR thought I would be able to go a day or 2 without washing my hair and looking disgusting and was so jealous of all my friends who were able to do that but now I can! Saves me so much time in the morning not having to blow dry and style every day.  It is a really light weight powder and almost has a bit of grit in the powder which makes my hair feel clean and freshened while giving it lift.  In my opinion this is what makes it better then any other because it does more then soak up oil.",AMAZING.

48117,"My interest for The Orb ceased with 1997's ""Orblivion"". I confess that I have not kept up to date, as for the most part the curiosity for them and their music was gone. I read ""The Dream"" was causing a stir as a return to their former sound, so I decided to check it out.

And what a disappointment! A very awkward album and a shadow of their past. They have abandoned their vast excursions into hyperspace in order to take their sound to accessible levels. I can barely hear any if any influences from the old times apart some ambient intros that work as fillers between the... songs.

Gone are the vast spacey arrangements, the kraut influences from Popol Vuh to Tangerine Dream of the early albums, the Steve Hillageisms although Mr. Rainbow Dome is present on several tracks here, his glissandos are absent and the ""openair"" ambient house feel of their early days. Instead, you get generic ambient electronica, Dreadzone influenced dub gone r'n'b, cheesy singing struggling to be catchy, slick late era Pink Floydisms, even some hillarious rap...

For completists maybe ""The Dream"" is a suggested listen, but be forwarneTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry if you are looking for a sequel to ""Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld"", ""UFOrb"" or ""Orbus Terrarum"", bypass! Being adventurous and innovative is ages behind this band. It would be better for Alex Paterson to do something else instead, and let the old days remain in the fond memories.

11498,"As pretty much anyone knows, evaluating a particular fragrance is entirely subjective and personal.  With that in mind, I quite like Rochas Eau Sensuelle and find it pleasantly fruity/floral with an appealing hint of spice to counteract and balance the sweetness.  The bouquet which is comprised of Rochas' signature white flowers plus mango and a smattering of dried fruit, is neither overwhelming nor cloying but as fresh and clean as a warm spring day.  And while its complexity certainly makes a statement, it is not so heavy that it cannot be worn during the day as long as you take care not to apply it too lavishly.

To avoid overapplication when using a spray bottle, rather than spraying it on myself directly, I prefer the old trick of lightly spritzing the air  and then walking into the cloud of fragrance.  I have never gone wrong with this technique.  You derive the subtle benefit of the lovely scent without stopping people in their tracks.","Fresh, delightful scent"

After numerous complaints, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment fixed the problem and sent out the corrected discs. Unfortunately, they did NOT recall the bad shipment just like Anchor Bay with Heathers, and there is nothing on the box to indicate which version is which. Ah, but there is a way to distinguish the two. The initial shipment had a sticker, in the lower lefthand corner, advertising ""VIP MOVIE POINTS  Buy and Bid!"" The newer, corrected version, does NOT have this sticker. Hope that helps everyone out. As far as the first Swedish subtitle being omitted, it was like that on the theatrical rerelease, too. So who knows? Now, as far as the DVD goes...wow. This is a Monty Python fan's dream come true. Oh sure, the transfer is far from perfect, and the 5.1 sound would not impress your grandmother. It is still leaps and bounds ahead of the VHS ugh! release, and the extra features are too numerous to mention here. I believe they are listed at the top of this page.

18042,"Shave cremes need lather and a feeling of fullness. There should be a richness to the lather and one should not have to use too much of the product to achieve that. Products like The Art of Shaving my personal favorite, Kiehl, and Lab all have excellent shave cremes that when applied with a brush give a sense of moisture that leads to a smooth shave. This Baxter product is inexplicably tepid. Even using alot of the creme on the brush, I never quite had a feeling of satisfaction with the richness of the lather. I had to use alot of the product to equal much less of the other three I have referred to. Now, I use a brush to apply the shave creme. Baxter shave creme was one of the most disappointing I have ever used.",A tepid shave creme

43659,"Francamente es una lastima que en esta grabacion, hecha a mayor gloria de MADONNA, que proporciona una 'Evita' muy bien cantada pero que peca de distante por momentos, se hayan descuidado algunos papeles, como el fundamental 'Che', que aqui esta a cargo de un ANTONIO BANDERAS muy bien el la vertiente psicologica del personaje, pero muy flojo en la parte meramente musical. Lo mismo puede decirse del 'Peron' de JONATHAN PRYCE, que es actor pero no cantante.
Cumple mucho mejor como 'Magaldi' un JIMMY NAIL, que sin tener la fuerza de un tanguero real sabe sacarle partido a su rol. De lujo la 'Amante de Peron' que nos brinda ANDREA CORR la vocalista de ""The Corrs"", que aqui se luce con ganas. Secundarios y coro cumplen con suficiencia, y algo mejor la orquesta.

41201,"Presto does not sound like the other Rush albums. It is still three guys from Canada being loud and playing well  still a progressive rock band in every sense. But Presto has some kind of underlying theme that is easy to hear but hard to describe. The lyrics are very good; this is probably the single best set of lyrics written by Neil Peart.
The only thing that stops me from listening to this CD over and over is the bad production. It is just too quiet. Put it in a multiple discchanger with any other rock album, and you will see or hear what I mean. It is like you turned the volume WAY down every time a Presto song plays. It needs to be remastered. If it is, it will be tied with Grace Under Pressure and Moving Pictures for the title of ""Best Rush Album Ever.""",A little magic

I remember seeing the box for this movie forever when I was a kid going to my local video store. Emilio Estevez looking intense, the blown out title, pop artist design of the box. It is certainly memorable. Course I never saw it. Until recently.
And I totally think it was worth the watch. Unfortunatley thought I watched it over the course of a couple days, so my viewing was very chopped up and I actually had to rewind it to catch some things I would missed when I was drifting off to sleep late at night on my first viewing.
It is campy, and silly, and strange, and very my kind of movie. It is basically a B movie, but a good one. My favorite parts were of course  if you know me  the really random things that happened or that people said. And of course the end was great.
Though, the movie falls short of being really good, only because the lead actress who has a sort of wierd plain face, but a great body never took it off. Do not Waste my... time!! ...

This was the turning point in our nation, when the true powersthatbe decided to exert their control over us. The rotating merrygoround of enemies since then has kept our once great fourth estate busy ginning us up with ever sickening nationalistic propaganda. Telling us who to hate and who to kill. Now that our government has total surveillance over us and the unbridled power to kill any one of us and the first, fourth and fifth amendments have been rendered impotent by a corporatized court system feeding hungry for profit prisons with more and more of us we are fast approaching another crucial moment in our nation's path. Are we to be nothing but serfs slaving for the corporation or will there be a resurgence of human spirit that usurps the traitors from our national shrines? We will see.

Compared to Mac software I would probably give this 4/5 stars.

159616,"I know this game is available for PS3 in Japan, however I do not speak Japanese and do not want to read a translator so I am writing this review from that perspective.

If you own a 360 and like RPG's you should own this game, no questions asked. It is the first GREAT RPG I have played this console generation. I should not have expected less from the ""Tales..."" games.

Pros:
1. Fighting system is very fun and addictive.
2. Story is good not great but very good.
3. Graphics are anime style but very fresh and crisp.

Cons:
1. There is almost TOO much to do. For perfectionists you will be spending over 100 hours.",Best on XBOX 360

185887,"Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",Worked like a charm

42906,"Personally, I think this is the best James Bond theme/promotion song since Die Another Day by Madonna. Skyfall is different from her previous work. In a way it is almost like the lyrics are telling the listener to never lose their cool or give up. Not in a poppy, club like way or whatever do not worry Ke$ha, you are still cool to me but with a firm, calm voice. I even like the orchestra too. They seem to have gotten the James Bondish feel with the orchestra at least in the beginning of the song. If Adele were to ever make a video for this, that would be kind of awesome. Adele singing in a James Bond suit.

All in all, this is worthy of a James Bond theme song. Away from the breakup songs from her 21 album.

I give this a 9.5 out of 10 if she did not repeat the chorus numerous times I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10 but this is still a good song.",Best since Die Another Day.

Instead, I devised my own way of putting on the skin. I took off the silicone layer, putting that on first, then putting the hardshell layer on afterwards. You will then have to make adjustments and wiggle around the skin so all the holes and phone buttons line up exactly. It takes a few minutes to get it all right. After that, the volume buttons and on/off toggle are easy to push and everything is as it should be.

The Surface accepts a MicroSD card, so it was easy for us to load up 64GB of films and kids shows for the road, and we took the chance that our hotel room would have a TV with an HDMI input, since most hotels do nowadays.

The cable arrived just before we left, so I did not even have a chance to test it beforehand, but once we got the hotel I plugged in the cable, switched the TV input, and voila, there was my Surface screen duplicated on the television!

Microsoft wanted four times the money for their solution, and I would still have had to add an HDMI cable extension.  This worked like a charm and creates a great solution for traveling.

184500,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

206819,"This is such a great tool for researching your roots and recording your family tree. These are two distinct tasks: researching and recording. Researching your background is where you find relatives you never knew you had. Recording is where you save the results of your research and report them to your future generations.

The 90day free access to the Ancestry genealogy records is outstanding. After 90 days, there is a monthly fee and the fee is pretty significant. Check their website for pricing.

One misconception about the research service is that you can find your living and recent relatives. I do not know all the details, but there are privacy restrictions that prevent the web service from giving you info on living people.

All in all, the software tool and the online service are really incredible, but they are not cheap. I recommend you do not activate the 90 day service until you know your calendar is free enough that you will be able to actually use it. Otherwise, you will not get the full benefit from the service before your 90 days elapse.

Researching your family's past really is an incredible journey. My mother traced one branch of our tree back to the Mayflower. Obviously this research was not simple. I cannot even imagine how much easier it would have been for her with a product like this.

Besides, these magazines' portrayals of superrich celebrities as ""normal"" people just like you and me is a prime example of how in the YOU.S. we are taught to worship the wealthy and to believe we, too will be wealthy one day.  Sorry Ms. Blythe, that is not a liberal idea, but a conservative one.  Also, the gossipy, malicious, tellall that this book is merely panders to the lowest common denominator and to the baser instincts which conservatives always bemoan liberalism and the sleazier aspects of pop culture as appealing to.

Office x4 could not be a better program but pressure from Microsoft20 owners, Vector capital 69Drunk or confused and other groups have caused it to lose most  of its unique features. The .wpd format is said to not be a  industry standard any more though I highly disagree. The existence of WP x4 is a testiomony to the strength of the program. Word has never faced this kind of fire before and probably would not survive if it had.

 Corel has done its absolute best to keep this fine piece of software together. Wordperfect has been a stable solid program since the seventh edition of the family pack and this edition is no different. People would argue that the lack of change is bad for WordPerfect. I think that Corel has made a very stable product that can do anything and everything better than any Office suite out there. The problem? The increasing similarity to MS Word. These days, the only things that Corel banks on is the ""compatibility"" with other Microsoft products like Word and Excel. The fact is that WordPerfect x4 does not need to imitate others. It is already good. For that matter, so is Quattro Pro which is an excellent spreadsheet that does not need to be compatible to excel or 123 to be good..

93620,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I have had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemicalsmelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to overfoam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",Outstanding Body Wash

I remember playing this the first time, the first few times, and it did not overwhelm and hook me like the previous albums had. But on continued listenings, I kept discovering hooks and licks, chorus bits strategically intergrated into songs, inversions of melodies that were just infectous. About a month after I would gotten the record I had it playing in my head, from first track to last, every day for quite a while. I have since concluded that, all told, this was their best album. The goal of it reminds me of another album by another group: ""Fearless"" by Family, which came out a couple of years later. Now, those of you who know Family know they are an entirely different sort of group from the As. But, the point of comparison here is that each band set out to fully show what they had the potential for. Each track is in a totally and completely different style of music from the rest. And, in that sense, each track is a masterpiece.","""Moonhenge"" was what we used to call this album . . . ."

205385,The liners appear durable and equal to many other like products.  questionable is that Husky and Amazon both list the Floor Liners to be compatible to all 2016 Chevy Colorado models when other manufacturers warn about the liners on the Colorado Base model and state do no use or list as incompatible  vinyl flooring does not get along with the sharp carpet pegs nor does the vehicle have the floor mat tabs to keep the liners from sliding around.  I still plan on using these as I want a means to protect the floor however will most likely modify the liners a little as well as invent a means to secure them in place.,2016 Colorad Base Model: Not necessarily compatible
225285,This is a product update. I purchased this feeder and the first year the wind blew it down my fault and the tray and dome cracked. I purchased a new tray and dome. Glued the tray replaced the dome. This is the beginning of the third year and the dome thread stripped out which is all that holds it up when you hang it. Needless to say the design is not very good. Also the dome could be bigger. Tray gets a lot of water when it rains. But I guess all feeders do. Tray could also be just a little bit bigger and deeper. Tray fills up too fast with seeds then fall to the ground. A lot of waste. Birds pull out a seed and two fall down. It is an ok feeder for the price but does not hold up very long.,"It's easy to fill, but dome could be designed better."

51188,"Purchased this unit a month or so back and combined the unit with Roomie Remote Apps. I find the combination works well and I have not problems.

Setup and configuration were easy and straightforward. The one issue that I did have was not with the GC IP2IR or with Roomie Remote, but with my router. I have a Fios router and needed to adjust the setting ""Enable Multicast"" by assigned IP address on my network. This took a little bit of effort to find the proper tables in my router setting, but the support at Roomie Remote was great and therefore I never needed to contact Global Cache. The unit works well without any problems. I would suggest you go to Global Cache website and download the iHelp tool for PCs there is a MAC version from a 3rd party that is needed to verify and update your firmware Mine was up to date. I will also say that SmartHome the seller did followup on the sale to make sure everything was ok.

I would recommend this product for those needing a remote control solution for your media center. Some IP networking technical knowledge is needed, but the support forums are powerful tools and will help you get everything setup and functioning.","Nice, Compact and works"

As far as ease of use when transposing or changing octave ranges these things work great in a live environment and studio. Very light weight which to me is a plus since I use them live.

So pretty much going with the Capcom trend they are releasing another version, the only catch is that if you bought this one, you are done for since the newer version will not have any upgrade options like Street Fighter did with the latest release.

49360,"Just picked this CD up.  It gets 4 1/2 stars only because it could have included a couple other faves like 'Dangerous' or 'Almost Paradise' from Loving Every Minute Of It. 'Strike Zone' from 'Keep It Up' would have been welcome here as well. Anyways, I have all the main studio albums and the compilation disc 'Loverboy Classics' but this is a better compilation for two reasons:

1 It is NOT mastered so loud that your ears bleed. You can actually crank this up a bit and it sounds great! The classics disc is mastered loud and can be tough on the ears...

2 The 2nd track 'For You' is an absolutely awesome track that I do not remember hearing back when these guys were all over the radio. This may be because the song was written in 1989 just before the band called it quits. They reunited briefly to support ""Big Ones"" and we are fortunate this song even made it to an official release. It is a true rocking tune in the spirit of 'Loving Every Minute Of It' and should be listened to cranked up to fully appreciate it.

Some of the reviewers complain about the lack of having this song or that song but I feel it is far more important to get a great tune that was never released anywhere else than getting songs that we already own on another disc...

Bottom line...do your self a favor and purchase this before it goes out of print. You will not be disappointed.",Worth it 'For you' - Not available anywhere else!  4 1/2 Stars

I guess they were stopping stocking the item and just wanted to get rid of the ones they had. Well, I will certainly give it a try. My previous experience with papaya was fresh in Hawaii, oh man was it good! and dried in several varieties quite good. Okay, here is fresh organic papaya chunks packed in organic pineapple juice. Does that sound good, or what? Hmmm. It is a product of Sri Lanka. Well, I have never had anything from Sri Lanka before.

This can of papaya chunks is excellent!! The taste is real good and it must have been canned right at the peak of ripeness. Good as it is, it is not very high in calories 60 per serving and three servings per 14ounce can. It is quite sweet, but I note there is no added sugar, it is just papaya and pineapple juice. Of course, it is got zero fat and no sodium either. Plus there some fiber and a lot of vitamin C. Boy, this stuff is not only delicious, it is just the nutrient mix I seek.

So much like a great friend as such, I may not always listen to this album and choose something more ""flavor of the month"", but this album is great for certain moments.  I have listened to this when I have suffered the late hours of the night on long assignments.  The music is salve for when I am going through deeply sad times in life.

I have had people say to me that this album is too dark for them.  I completely disagree.  I think this album is full of hope in the face of misery, like the rising sun that banishes the night.  Maybe it is just me.

I was recommended this album by a friend, an avid fan of black metal.  I, however am not into metal, yet Shadows of the Sun quickly grew on me.  I have listened to other Ulver albums before but this is still my favorite.  I cannot really describe the music besides introverted and sentimental  almost spiritual.

I know when an album deserves five stars when I can listen to it over and over again without feeling worn down or sick of it.  I could go on and on about my relationship with this album, but I think buyers should just try it out.  This may not be for everyone, but this is still an album unlike any other.

First, let us start with stylish exterior, you can feel the quality of the finish and the precision fit and finish of this product, unlike the consumergrade crap you will get from HP.

Next, I want to thank Dell for not loading the unit with marketing crapware, like HP and Lenovo do, this unit boots quickly and cleanly!

I got this unit for my 12 year old daughter and the bringup was seamless, no drivers to find and load, or even to update! Bravo again to Dell.

Lastly, let us talk features! The keyboard is backlit, which is a very nice feature that you usually do not find, and the screen is a touchscreen too, even though neither Amazon or Dell seem to be trumpeting these features.

Finally, let us talk battery performance! This unit gets awesome battery performance while still being lightweight, even when my daughter plays Minecraft on it!

So, as far as price/performance/quality this unit is the way to go, as I strongly recommend this device for anyone needing a Windows 10 Laptop PC!

Even if you are a gamer!",Flawless!

211976,I do not even know where to begin with this software. Let me start off by saying that it is not very user friendly. There is a lot bloatware that comes along with it. I was really disappointed at the fact that I kept getting errors when trying to upload to You Tube. What is the point of having the option incorporated if you cannot even use. I did finally get a video uploaded but it took forever. It is hard to find support on their website plus they want to charge you for calling in to ask for advice on how to get their software to work properly. I like the fact that there are many options available to you in the software but I hardly get the opportunity to use them because the software itself is always freezes up and then I have to hit ctrl alt delete to get the crappy software off of my screen. I have tried using this software for several months in order to really form an accurate opinion and I honestly cannot recommend this software to anyone.

57182,"Here are the reasons I find these USB extension cables so convenient:

1 It makes it easy to connect a device to USB ports on the back of a desktop.
2 The male end of my printer's USB cable is a bit wide and prevents access to adjacent ports.
3 The same applies to wide flash drives.
3 I have a USB port on a monitor that is not convenient to access.
4 If you have a tight cluster of USB ports, it just makes it easier to plug into an extension.
5 I have a USB ports on the left side of my laptop, and plugging into the port with my clumsy left hand is not too smooth and may possibly damage the port over time.

It is a little difficult to explain the above examples in words, but hopefully it helps.

QUALITY:
This USB extension cable appears to be made very well. The two that I purchased a year ago have been problemfree. I just purchased a third one.

The connections are a little snug, depending on the particular device that I am attaching. However, it has not been problematic for me. I would still recommend this product based on my positive experience.

PROS:
 Very handy for accessing USB ports that are not easily accessible.
 Allows access to adjacent ports that are blocked from cables or flash drives that are too wide.
 Good quality
 Reasonable price

CONS:
 Might be snug with some devices. However, not really an issue for me, but it is a personal preference kind of thing.",Multiple reasons I find this very handy.

Every Western clich is presented in a perfect balance of kitch and seriousness. Dietrich and Stewart sizzle on the screen together, truly  the chemistry is undeniable. And there are so many, many classic scenes  you have probably seen many of them parodied, but seeing them in context, for real, is just a priceless experience. Marlene plays the role she was born to  it is so great to see her early films where she plays a refined woman, and then to watch this and have your jaw drop over the character she is playing  she is so obviously having a ball.

122776,"Bought this as a replacement for a junk one that came in a Washburn Dime 332. The ones that I got with the guitar were 250k and mini pots.

These are a tight fit compared to the mini pots that were in there but they do fit very nice, almost perfect, in the back control cavity
Unfortunately the shaft that gets screwed to the body of the guitar is shorter then the OEM. That means you cannot use the lock washer or 1st nut if you plan on using this on a Washburn Dime of any type. I do not own a Dean so I cannot tell ya either way

I also had to use a round file to open the shaft holes on the body of my guitar a little more for the turning part of the potentiometer to fit. So that also means your original knobs will not work on this pot either.

These knobs are not linear and have a custom audio taper set by DeMarzio that I like so far. It makes it easier to get a clean tone with only using your volume knobs... that is what I have noticed at least.",Pots that sound great

But the Susan Bates Company ought to be reprimanded for misleading it is customers with the name of the knitting needle. I do not care if it said or not plastic anywhere  i have a problem with the title because it immediately misleads the person into not checking if the knitting needle is actually made of metal rather than plastic.

I used to stay away from spread and estate collared shirts and mostly stuck to button down collar shirts because they looked more refined without a tie, the collars stayed in place.  But these shirts do not look as good with a tie unless you use a tie bar or pin to bring the collar together.

Enter the Wurkin Stiffs magnetic collar stays, and you get the best of both worlds, with a slightly rolled collar that gives you a great standup collar look with or without a tie!

Most of the pictures hint this product works best without a tie to keep your collars attached to the shirt, but I found you can also use them with a tie for a great collar roll effect without pins or buttons.  Just tie your tie and leave your top button unbuttoned.  Then reach in and put one of the small magnets near the collar stay and it will find its place like a heatseeking missle.  Repeat on the other collar, button your top button and cinch up your tie!

215092,"I have been using TT for probably close to 20 years.  I was about to switch to something else this year when I initially learned that the Deluxe version would no longer support information for stocks and bonds. TT backpedaled and prior year buyers of TT Deluxe received a free upgrade to the Premiere edition.  However, I will jump ship next year if the Deluxe version does not include the above, as it has every year up to now.

Anyway, I like the convenience of how TT automatically imports information from previous years without a lot of effort on my part.  I do not like how it almost forces you to efile your state return, even though it costs an additional $24.95 only Fed efile is free.  Then, if you want to print out your state return and mail it in there is no easy way because you have to include certain fed tax return forms if you itemize, etc.  The easy solution would be if TT offered a box to click on to efile or another box to print out and mail in your state return right next to it.

Just a small gripe.  We will see what TT does with the Deluxe version next year.",Mixed Feelings

1. The pressure hose reel is very hard to turn  could almost break the handle turning it. Will call factory about it.
2. The siphon tube stopped drawing soap after 3 uses. It was diluted and was not thick.
3. There is no way to lock the trigger ""on."" I am sure this is a safety feature but my hand started to ache after 15 minutes of use. I have a strong hand, by the way. I am figuring out a way to lock it manually  vise grip, Velcro, etc.
4. The cord storage leaves a lot to be desired. You just make a coil and hand it on the hook. Would have been nice to wrap it it more securely.

211443,"Hey You all,

When I received this software, I was certain that it would be just like Norton or McaFee.  I was really wrong.

I took my computer offline for a few minutes and installed the software on the disk...I have to tell you, I get REALLY nervous about this stuff because I received opened an email years ago only to host a worm.  I used to work with a large computer systems corp. and I was so embarrassed that this could happen to me.
What is worse, is that I am working on my Masters and my professor wanted to know what was up.  I came clean and we stayed and worked out much of the vulgar code, it was finished with a few hours or so.

I have always loved computers and newest tech 'funstuff', but, that old stuff Norton  McAfee slowed down my computer/performance plus, they wore extremely expensive for the time.  I choose not to reenlist in the Army several months ago and has a really hard time finding the right type of security attention.

It was obvious that the Kaspersky and Avira were the next two to be tested according to magazine articles.  I prefered Kaspersky because of it was just so damn easy to adjust.  Avira was a little more difficult, however, it had a cost that was almost a 1/2 more than other systems.

There are so many features on the cover that I cannot really type them out so, I will just post them for your viewed,

I hope that my review helped you in some way.

70230,"I found ""Tender Is The Night"" to be a very captivating story  from the beginning to the end. It is an engaging story which grabbed not  only my attention, but also my imagination by leading me to make early  conclusions about how the story was going to turn out. I was reading the  book always waiting for my predictions to come true, which kept me in some  suspense. I found this facet of the book to be very exciting. However,  unfortunately for me, I was wrong in some of my premature conclusions, and  so, I was inevitably a little disappointed by the end. My suggestion is to  read with some wonderment about what is to happen, but try not to set  yourself up for any initial conclusions you might come to about the final  destiny of the characters. Speaking of the characters, you definitely take  on their emotions or develop your own about them, making the book that much  easier to read and enjoy. I was liking some, feeling sorry for others, and  still completely disliking others. The only negative thing I would say,  looking back over the book, is that I do believe that there are some  aspects of the characters' emotions and predicaments, which are alluded to,  but then dropped. So, I was left with the feeling at times of expecting the  deeper meaning of a character's wants, needs, and reasoning to unfold  later. However, I found they never did. I, of course, could have been reading  more into the words than what was intended. All in all, though, I recommend  getting a copy and allowing yourself to be drawn into this emotional story.  I think most people will find it enjoyable and easy to read.",Captivating

Rosie's grandfather had died recently, it is then she discovers that her grandfather has left her a large sun of money. Provided she marries Lee. From then on Ros is totally distrusting of him, why else would this tall gorgeous and really popular guy be interested in her. But Lee claims that they know one another from when they were children, and he has always had a thing for her. But Rose does not remember him at all.

I liked this story, the characters were well drawn, especially Rose. The book picks up the further you get into it. The ending really sucks. It is a cliffhanger.

458,"Wellness is a quality grainfree source of dog food, however our German Shepherd Dogs simply did not seem to like the food nor did it seem to perform quite as well as Taste of the Wild Salmon flavor.  Our dogs coats and vibrancy proves which food is the best.  Wellness Core is far superior to Purina or Iams or Hill's Science diet but it is a far cry from the best commercial dog foods. Obviously the very best food for most dogs is a species appropriate diet of raw food and bones, but it is not as convenient to feed as a commercially prepared food.

July 2015 Update:  We were given an opportunity to try this food again.  I have upgraded this food to 5 stars because it is grain free and it is overall quite healthy with a list of READABLE ingredients. Our dogs still prefer TOTW Salmon flavor but overall this is indeed a decent dog food, just not the best for the money according to our dogs taste preference.","Superior to Purina toxic crud, our dogs still prefer Taste of the Wild Salmon Flavor"

31109,"There honestly has beena  strong lack of great songs out there right now. So, there have been a few newcomers that really have caught a strong eye lately, and Lady Antebellum has honestly been a huge surprise. Their latest single Need You Now is a simple and straightforward Country crossover that handles well. I really was surprised about the song. It really is not a bad song to listen to, and a great escape from acts like Rihanna, and Beyonce' who have been a bit overexposed on radio. I am really eager to hear what they have coming up next for their next single. Hopefully, it can be something just as great and something that fans will need them for soon.

It gets 4 stars because it is a brilliant idea that actually works, but it needs to be constructed better it could be a bit sturdier. If it came with litter suggestions, that would be great.

UPDATE: We no longer even try to use the ""selfcleaning"" feature. I would love to use cheap, environmentallyfriendly, nonclumping litter, but it just does not do the job. Even if we mixed it with half clumping litter, it ends up being a dirtier, stinkier litter box. In the end, we gave up because the urine clumps are generally too large for the drawer.",it works!!!!!

The crockpot helps keep dinner on the table during the work week by letting things cook slowly while I am away, and this cookbook is one of my favorite goto resources to keep dinner interesting. I never liked the old ""open a few cans, dump them in, and walk away"" versions of cooking in the crockpot, so this cookbook is in a different, much better, league of its own.

The color on each of those has varied, but this Vita Liberata one has left me with a consistent color that looks natural even on my fair skin.

I did end up purchasing the VL mitt for six dollars to use with this and the mousse, and would really recommend doing to.  The mitt helps keep the product off your hands and thus avoid orange palms, and helps you apply it in a more even way.  I had an Ulta brand mitt I used with previous products, but the VL is a bit thicker and softer.

This does dry out your skin, so it is important to use a more moisturizing body wash in the shower and lotion.

Although the VL products claim to not have the selftanner smell, they definitely still do.  I will say, though, that it is not as strong as other selftanners.

However, the story is divided into three small parts that cost $1.99 each, so you end up paying $6 for a novella not even a full book.

I replaced the screens on the front windows in my living room holes and fraying and the new screens are barely visible.  This screen material seems to be much better than what was in my existing windows assume the old screens were original to the windows.  I am not sure if this is a trick or a widely known practice, but I would start the spline on one end of the window and then as I ran the tool along to get the rest of the spline in I would pull on the spline stretching it so it would go in easier.

45500,"musically the album is quite good, and that is commented by others here.  I want to add though, dropping 'Fing' in the middle of a ballad is a nono for a reason.  It is not just that maybe I am a prude.  It is not that I have not done it myself, in conversation, when I should not.  But it is this: you cannot do that.  Now, I cannot play the album in my restaurant or for my kids, unless I build a playlist and take that one song out, if I can remember which one.  There is a reason .. Degas only goes so far in his paintings.  Allusion is good, but unless tossing away families with young people is a desired factor, it should be kept in mind.  Another thing is ... MIck Jagger was a phenom at burying really tart lyrics in his songs in a manner that if you know what the words mean and you also want to really think about them, then you pick them up, and meanwhile the kids and the grandparents, it goes right over their heads.  That is a good trait to learn from.  Food for thought, for the next album.  I mean, a soft ballad, with ""F'ing"" right in the middle of it?  DId the Ramones even do that?  Has anyone ever done that before?","musically the album is quite good, and that's commented by others here"

19775,"I have been wearing some dark makeup throughout the winter, but when I pulled MaryLou Manizer from my beauty drawer, I knew it was springand time to change up my look.

MaryLou Manizer, a highlighter, should not be confused with BettyLou Manizer, a bronzer.  The adorable package will help you make the right choice.  MaryLou comes in a round mirrored compact with a mug shot, that is right, a mug shot of bad, blonde MaryLou.

My skin is pale, my hair is dark, and my eyes are green.  I love MaryLou Manizer for daytime as an allover eye shadow.  It highlights under my brow and on my eyelid it really makes my lashes stand out.

The honeycolored powder adds a lot of shimmer without looking glittery.  It is very soft and easy to apply.  I do find that it can gather in the creases of my eyelids by the end of the day, but because the color is so light, I really have to look for it.

I find that my eyes look brighter and much less tired when I swipe on MaryLou Manizer in the morning.

Personally, I would not wear it as a highlighter on the rest of my face unless I was heading to a party or to the beach.  I just do not think it is the right look for me.",Leaves Me Bright Eyed

Are we that tainted by all the sexy books that we have to be so critical of a few minor editing issues?  The book was FREE!  I for one can overlook the grammatical errors, they certainly did not interfere with the storyline!!  Emma has been convinced by her best friend Violet to fake being an escort for just one night.  Violet's handsome, rich older brother Conrad has just broken up with his girlfriend.  He had planned to propose but a bitter argument caused him to change his mind.  His sister finds out that he had requested that his secretary arrange an escort for a charity ball because he was tired of romantic entanglements.  Both Conrad and Emma feel an instant attraction and succumb to a one night fling.

That first time you try it you will probably find the texture to be a little weird; a slightly rubbery feel and somewhat chewy.  I did not notice a different taste when using spaghetti sauce.  This is so much healthier with the fiber and the drastically lower carbs per serving, but what initially had me coming back to this was the lack of digestive discomfort and needing to take something for it.  This is my default pasta.

I have tried some other pastas made with rice or other beans, but this one is the easiest to work with.  There is a very small window for rice pasta to not be under or overdone and the other pastas I have used made from other beans clump together.  I spend the entire time cooking those attempting to declump them.

45507,"I will leave it to you, the reader, to research the Straight No Chaser phenomenon if they are new to you. For those of us already in the diehard fan club, this new recording just cements the brilliance of the group's arrangements and vocal chops. The sense of humor evident in many of the numbers is the perfect antidote for those who suffer from ChristmasisjustSOOOOserious syndrome.

The recording is quite good, with just a bit of cuppedhands/boxy coloration on some of the lead vocals. Imaging is spectacular on my system, with lots of apparent depth and good use of panning on some of the songs. There is unbelievable instrument mimicing, too. You will not believe at times that these guys' voices are all you are hearing.

I think two of the selections are not quite up to snuff, stylistically speaking, but I will leave it to you to figure out which two. Your mileage may vary.

My only OMG moment was in reading the song titles on the back cover. Someone at Atlantic's graphics department managed to misspell Dreidel they spelled it ""Driedel."" Shame on them!. It is nice that the group cites the sources of some of the snippets they incorporate into their material.

This will definitely go into my Top 10 Christmas CD collection. With dozens of discs in my collection competing for the honor, that is saying something.

And an afterthought: sometimes SNC reminds me a bit of Manhattan Transfer in their precision and extratight harmonies. Both are Atlantic Records artists. Can you imagine a supergroup made of these two acts? Maybe they could call themselves ""Straight No Transfer."" G",More a cappella fun from SNC

I am using this portable charger with my Samsung Epic 4G Touch Samsung Galaxy S II. I call it ""The Mighty Mouse Charger"" because it is small, very portable but it is powerful at 5600mAH. The price is nice. I showed it to people they thought it cost more than the $49 I paid for it.

This portable charger charges at the same rate as the AC charger that comes with the phone. I can take this charger everywhere I go, it can be placed in a pants pocket with a lot of room to spare. The Samsung Epic 4G Touch has a battery life of 12 to 13 for medium use. I am a heavy user, I use the internet, Netflix, play games/music. Netflix alone can drain your phone battery pretty fast if you watch a more for one hour. I am still testing it out. You have to charge it for four to five hours the first time you get it. After that it should last 3 to 4 days before you have to charge it again.

This Anker Power Bank charger really comes in handy. I highly recommend it. Oh I had the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack.

Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them.

It has a stateliness and sadness that approximate the themes of the story, that man cannot be saved  by his reason and logic alone but in a world of inexplicable evil must  submit to Christian salvation.  Like it or not, politically correct or not,  that is how O'Connor felt.

214401,"I have been using Quicken since the late 80's.  I switched to Microsoft Money when it came out  a far superior product  but was moreorless forced to revert to Quicken when Money was discontinued.  In the early 2000's I switched to mostly using Mac computers, and started using Quicken Mac, but Intuit rapidly begin stripping essential features from the program, so I had to go back to the Windows version.

I just upgraded to the 2014 version, and like every Intuit product upgrade I have ever had, it is extremely buggy.  I will just mention a couple of items, but there are plenty more.  First, if you use flags to identify particular transactions, you can expect them to be lost when you convert.  Gone, like the wind.  Second, when working in the ""Unreconciled"" screen using that filter, the program constantly crashes, and has to be reopened over and over.  Third, and most annoying to me personally so far, whereas you simply had to enter your password vault password to download transactions from your bank and other financial institutions, once you do that now you are prompted to log in to Intuit with your Intuit password.  I have no interest in logging into Intuit to download transactions that are none of their business.

I have long wished there was a suitable alternative to Quicken, as I have come to avoid Intuit products like the plague some of you may remember when the company foisted it is CDilla copy protection scheme on purchasers of Turbo Tax one year, until consumer outrage forced them to back off.

4251,"The Stewart ProTreat Freeze Dried Treats are made in the USA without additives or preservatives in a USDA inspection facility. Though the liver is freeze dried, it still maintains the fullflavor, aroma, and nutritional value of raw liver. These treats are so simple, it is not funny! There is one ingredient; 100 turkey liver. The treats can be fed three times daily  I personally think that is too much. And for a dog over 60 pounds mine is 100 pounds, they recommend 46 of the treat pieces. The good thing is that there is only 6 calories per treat.

My dog loves these treats! But, I personally do not like them. And it is not that I do not like the brand, the flavor, the product itself. What I do not like is the smell. It is so strong and nauseating. Thankfully, I have gotten out of giving Gavan these treats. My mother has been giving them to him. It is crazy how much he enjoys these Stewart ProTreat Freeze Dried Turkey Liver Treats. He gobbles them right up and then looks around to see if there are more for him. It took a few weeks, but he is finally gone through the whole tub of the treats.

I was sent the Stewart ProTreat Freeze Dried Turkey Liver Treats in exchange for my honest opinion. However, all the opinions expressed here are my own.",Dog loves them

72465,"Noone who has really read this book can find that this is a rewrite of Lords and Ladies. While Lords and Ladies was the weakest book of the whole series and made me somehow dislike the Witches sphere, this one  reconciliates me with it.  Finally the other witches have stepped out of  Granny Weatherwax's shadow. This makes the book far more interesting than  e.g. Lords and Ladies or Witches Abroad. The weakness of Granny Weatherwax  in this book makes her a more human and less dominant character. While with  the other books I nearly feeled that Granny would somehow take over  sometime, this one puts her in her right position again. Nanny Ogg, Magrat  and especially Agnes finally get the role they deserve.
Beside the  Witches theme, the vampire theme has also been treated in an excellent  manner. By exaggerating and mixing the attributes usually identified with  vampires, Pratchett has created a marvellous satire, only comparable to  Pyramids.
Finally, with the priest of Om, the religious theme is again  treated in Carpe Jugulum. I was very pleased with that because I think that  Small Gods was one of Pratchetts best books and regretted that religious  controverse did not reappear in his following books.
Conclusion: a  masterpiece in every aspect",Certainly not a re-write of Lords and Ladies

It is a great looking game. The audio is up to par. The electronic music matches perfectly, while the audio design is top notch.

Those are both on here, but there also been other fine tunes that I have found myself liking a lot as well. I do not think I would ever listened to an entire album by Manfred Mann before getting this CD, and now I could kick myself for ignoring them for so long. I suppose they were considered ""too pop"" because they had a few hit singles, but most of the material on here straddles the line between progressive rock and the heavier side of poprock. Some very creative compositions and long instrumental passages with wicked guitar riffs and blazing keyboards. And this particular collection has over 70 minutes of music, including some decent live tracks I am sure that felt like they had to include alive version of ""The Mighty Quinn"", but it is far from the best cut on here.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

108976,"Most people in the public at large now know Peter Jackson for his amazing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, and his upcommig latter two installments. His older movies, laced with devilish wit, extreme violence, and original plots are definitely worth taking a look at.
The story is about a young man with an overbearing mother, your typical dysfunctional family with a tainted history. One day, when her son is on a date at the zoo, she follows them and is bitten by the zoo's most gruesome and  unusual display, a ""Rat Monkey"" the offspring of foreign rats mating with tree monkeys.
Without giving too many details away, the results are horrific. The amount of violence in this movie is extreme, but done so in a way that is more silly than horrifying. Graphic as it is, it is all part of the fun. People who are sensitive to blood and gore should probably avoid this movie all the same.
The ""Dead Alive"" DVD is worth getting mainly because it contains the Unrated version, which is the only way to see this movie. Where I live, the Unrated version was not available on video, so the DVD was a great find. The ""R"" version in question is not worth taking a second look at, since it is extremely watered down, and much of the satirical fun is removed. The DVD has the standard DVD functions, such as subtitles and widescreen. A bit lacking in the extra features department, but I am not complaining.
If you are curious about Jackson's older movies, this is definitely one of his best. I would recommend watching this with ""Meet the Feebles"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"". It would be one unusual film fest. Enjoy.",Peter Jackson's best cult film. Not for weak stomachs.

I agree this is a good Chrisitan kid show that teaches important things about God's Ten Commandments. It is absolutely important to follow them in the correct way! I do feel sorry, though, for the life Seth has, with his dad dead, and living in the desert alone with his mother. He might have a sad life. Again, I think this is a good show for young Christian kids to learn from about God's Ten Commandments.

As a seventeen year old boy, my favorite tv show is Little House on the Prairie. It is a show a lot of Christians enjoy watching, and I recommend it.","Good Christian show, not-too-interesting life"

If you have never tried it, you will not believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.
Next, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it is wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.
Afterwards, a good quality moisturizer or oil and you are all set.",Taking care of your skin

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

There are a couple fairy tale creatures, a tiny bit of action, but mostly this story is about relationships.

The longer version:
So I was bummed about the amount of fairy tale creature interaction this book had. The horned boy in the coffin does not have much ""page time"". I feel like we barely meet him, barely get to learn his story, barely have some adventure with him. The story is mostly about a sister and brother. It is about them being neglected as kids, the problems with her brother's gift, why she kisses a lot of boys, wandering the woods pretending to be knights, why they keep secrets from each other...on and on. It is good to have relationships build and stories shared, but it was not what I thought this book was offering. For how much could have happened with this fairy tale land around them it felt empty.

73094,"This case is really two pieces, leather front and back, and a harder plastic case. The outer case is the better of the two in terms of quality and design. It has a magnet  on the flap to keep the front cover closed. Should you want to leave it open on you desk, you can fold it back, even using the flap to keep it open or you can use it as a horizontal stand.. Additionally there is a small pocket inside the front flap, large enough hold a credit card, ID, and bills. The plastic case seems like the weakest part of this case. While I do like the openness of the case on the bottom to avoid any lightening adapter issues, it is too open elsewhere, meaning if you drop this phone and it lands on an unprotected side, your iPhone will damage at least slightly. I also wish it gripped the phone tighter. It seems like with use, especially if you take the phone in and out of the case  too often, it might stop holding the phone altogether.

22518,"It is a great little airbrush system; not terribly noisy and works well for Spectrum Noir markers. You might want to put it on something like a rubber mat or something  that would reduce the noise and also the walking not much it does as it works.
The ONLY adapter included was ONE for Spectrum Noir. I do not know the shape of Copics, so I do not know if they will work. SN are hexagon and I do not think Copics are.

Con? Some marker tips do not line up directly with the air, so they do not work as well as others do...but I think that is the markers not all being lined up exactly the same in the hexagon shape.

CON: I have updated some of my wide nibs to the brush tips  the airbrush will NOT work with them. NOTHING, NOT at all. I had already purchased the airbrush when I started upgrading my markers to the brush tips only to find out they do not work together at all. Very unhappy with that outcome. And the colors I have updated would most likely be the ones I would use most with the airbrush  blues for the sky, greens for the grass, etc.

That way water can still pass through, but the seeds will not. When there are too many hulls, I will just lift the fabric out, shake the hulls off, and then replace it. I have not had any experience yet, but it SHOULD work. I will update my review later.

I was drawn to these colors immediately and was excited to try them. I was very disappointed with the lack of pigment however. I used primer prior to applying, and despite this after applying all the colors were so similar there was really not enough contrast to make them ""strikingly"" different once they were out of the compact and on my eyes. Once applied the shimmer is more pronounced than the pigment is and I am just not impressed with this particular set. Perhaps if the colors were matte, or had less shimmer I would be more impressed.

Jordan has to resist him. At least that is what he keeps telling himself as Eric continues to pursue him. He knows he cannot risk his future and responsibilities on just playing around with Eric Higgins.

Play Hard is JT Fox's debut novel and it was a really good start. This serial has a lot of potential to be great. I think Play Hard was developed well considering the length of the story.

Either way, the point is that now the blades are made in China the quality control has obviously gone to crap.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

162431,"You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category  The Economist.

Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.

Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.

BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the nonfeature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a onesentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you are pressed for time.

A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen.

The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30 of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.","A Better Value, but with some issues"

251854,"Bought this for my 4 year old. My son is fairly skinny, a tad shorter than a 4 year old. However this did fit his pretty well. Besides the fact that the pants were a little long, the waist was not that loose but with the buckle it drooped bad.
 The buckle kept falling off most of the night and we just eventually took it off all the way. The mask is made alright and it lasted Halloween and a few dress ups, but eventually did break with rough play. The arm guard stuck onto the Velcro pretty well, however did not fit on well while he was in his car seat, which we eventually took off. The costume was loose enough for my son to wear a sweat jacket underneath.
 One thing I would change would the belt buckle piece be actually attached to the costume instead of a add on that falls off all the time. Overall decent costume worth the money.

184319,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

57608,"Pros:
 Fit is great. To give you a point of reference, they did not move one bit while I was skipping rope.
 They are comfortable even after a 90 minute workout.
 I did not think they would block as much outside noise judging on the fit, but I was quite surprised.
 Easy to pair to your phone.
 Comes with a 1ft. micro USB cable to charge  2 sets of tips.

Cons:
 Sounds quality is not too good... I do not work out with high end headphones. I went from Sony MDRA200 $20 to the MPOW Cheetah and it is a big drop off in quality. It reminds of those cheap headphones you would get with a cassette player back in the day.

Other info:
 My phone 2014 Moto X was having issues connecting to my bluetooth HRM while they were already connected to these headphones. My solution was to connect the HRM first, headphones second. Problem solved.

I have only worked out with them once, but if there is another con over time for example, the battery does not last as long as advertised, or sweat makes its way in and ruins them, then I will update my review accordingly. However, for the price I paid, I would not be terribly disappointed if I only got a year out of them.

Overall, if poor sound quality is not a deal breaker for you, then get these phones.","Great for the price, but not perfect"

For me, this was very confusing. I spent like an hour or more redoing my taxes, because the refund amount seemed way off.

If you are tempted to buy the bundled group of coffee maker, water filter and permanent gold coffee filter featured on this page, please note that the cone filter 04933 does NOT fit the Krups KM9008!  I discovered this the hard way  I simply assumed that the featured filter was offered because it fit this machine and thought I would be saving myself some shopping time by ordering it along with the machine. This machine requires a basket type filter and not a cone filter.  I found that a standard Mr. Coffee gold basket filter for 812 cup coffee makers fits this model.  As to the machine itself  I am delighted with it  it is very easy to operate and solves the problem of different ""coffee times"" within my family.  No more sludgy coffee sitting in the warming carafe. I noted that one reviewer complained of the temperature of the coffee produced, but I have found it to be piping hot even after it is been in the machine for close to two hours. Bottom line is this machine produces a delicious, hot cup of coffee. I think you will be pleased with it.","Great machine, but bundled filter doesn't fit machine"

47129,"It may be hard now to understand the depth of loathing that was directed at Paul McCartney when ""Ram"" was originally released in the dark days of the postBeatles breakup era.
Indeed, much of Paul's work after the Fabs imploded is hard to take. But the fact is the strength of the Beatles was collective in nature, and each member served as a counter balance to the massive egos not necessarily a bad thing involved. And each member's solo work suffered the same inconsistent quality that plagued Paul.
To be honest, you could probably only cobble together a couple of strong LPs of ""greatest"" hits from the solo Fabs body of work
with Ringo faring the best in terms of comparison to his Beatles songs.
But ""Ram"" hardly deserved the unremitting barbs hurled at it from all critical and ""hip"" sides. It is a wonderful and entertaining pop work that has aged very gracefully.
In my opinion, ""Ram"" is Paul's best postBeatles work other than his masterful and gutsy ""Band on the Run.""","Not a masterpeice, but hardly a disaster"
42477,"All right, I have something I need to get off my chest. First, though, the review. This is incredible. While not quite in the class of Blood on the Tracks and the electric trilogy of 6566, its still a dern fine piece of work, right next to Freewheelin', John Wesley Harding,  and Time Out of Mind, masterpieces all. Tweedle Dee is a great opener, bluesy, a little bluegrass, awesome, straight through the finale Sugar Baby, which is a song that can take it is rightful place in Dylan's canon next to the other greats. Po' Boy is a wonderful song along with the fun Summer Days, the blues rocker Lonesome Day Blues, and especially Highwater, the second best song on the album, behind the instant classic, Mississippi. This brings me to what really cheeses me. How, how I ask, can people criticize his voice? A conventional voice singing Mississippi would have made it just a good song. Dylan's voice does something to it that is unimaginable if you have heard the Sheryl Crow version. His voice is an additional instrument that no one else knows how to play. Dylan's is truly beautiful singing. This voice is a worldweary, but I have survived dangnabbit voice and is truly a revelation. Feel free to follow Ricky Martin and his crew of phonies who are destroying American music, if that is your thing; eventually you will find that road leads nowhere and long after they are gone, Dylan will remain.",I'm About to Hit Someone

I did a little research on the various styles and brands available, and based off of the reviews, as well as the materials used and the look, I opted to go with this one. I am so glad I did! I have had it for nearly a month, and although it is taking my husband a while to get used to it, I absolutely LOVE it!

197985,"I wish I could rate this less than 1 start. I tried this multiple times.  First I followed the directions to the T on the back of the packaging.  Mirror fell off.

I then decided to clean the area, use the prep pad then use more of the adheasive on the metal backing plate instead of the recommended drop in the center.  I let it sit over night before putting my rear view mirror back on.  As SOON as I went to adjust the mirror it fell off.

I said there is no way that that is possible so I tried it one last time, this time I did the same cleaning/prep, then used a small metal blade to evenly coat the back of the metal rear view mirror tab with the adheasive.  Let it sit an ENTIRE day. Put mirror back on and it fell off as soon as I adjusted it.

This product does NOT work.  Use 3m Windo weld... it will never come off again.  I like Permatex products but this is definitely a fail.","Horrible, does not work at all."

My husband said they do not come with caps because you are supposed to remove the blade when not using it.  I said well then why is there not something to put the blade in?

If you do not want to haul out your cutting board, all you have to do is push down and tear the crust away.  As other reviewers have stated, this item is slightly too big for a regular sized loaf of commercial bread.  You can get around this problem by using a larger loaf of bread than usual or just cut it in the way that best fits your bread.  Your kiddo probably will not notice.  I used it tonight to cut pizza dough to make heart shaped pizzas to include in my son's Valentine's Day lunch for tomorrow.  It worked perfect.

170042,"What do you get when you have a hot Cuban MMA fighter and a bossysexy Brazilian gym owner? You get one hot story, that is what ! I Have been following the Worth the Fight series from Sidney Halston from the beginning and was really looking forward to Tony and Francescas story.  Tony is the kind of hero that if you did not love so much, you would hate.  Hes macho, arrogant, a womanizer, overly jealous and has a raging temper.  Hes horrible, right? WRONG! I wanted yo hate Tony so many times during the book, wished that Francesca would just slap his smug face and tell him to get lost.  But then he would say something totally sweet and unexpected with his smooth Latin accent and you just cannot help it, you turn into a gooey mess, wishing you were in Francescas skyhigh stilettos
These two getting together was not a big surprise.  What was surprising was how insecure Francesca turned out to be underneath that tough, polished armor.  Only a very determined man could have broken through it. And  Tony is the perfect man for the job.  The story has its ups and downs. Frankly, I thought that Francescas insecurities were a bit too much, but in the end even she could not ignore Tonys charms.
I have to say that the men of Worth the Fight Academy seem to be getting sexier and sexier as the series continues.  I Am guessing that Cains story is going to be  next . I absolutely love this series and believe that its one of the best sports romance series out there.  Do Not deny  yourself this pleasure!!!

A 4 oz. jar of active dry yeast at the local grocer costs between $3.68 and $4.38 or the equivalent of between $14.42 and $17.52 a pound.

I had formerly been able to purchase a 1 lb. pouch of Red Star Active Dry Yeast at one of the warehouse stores, but they no longer have it available.  I was pleased to find Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2Pound Pouch on Amazon and contacted their partner America Anywhere about the products expiration date and the conditions under which the yeast was stored.  They responded rapidly and their information was both specific and accurate.

For home use, I transfer 4 oz. of yeast to an old yeast jar and store it in the refrigerator.  I use a clip to fasten the opened pouch, place it in a freezer bag that I seal and then store it in the freezer until I need to replenish the smaller jar.  This maintains the active aspect of the yeast until several months after the expiration date.

Purchasing Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2Pound Pouch resulted in a tremendous savings and, with an expiration date of January 2017, the product is fresh and has enough longevity remaining that I need only use between 9 oz. and 10  oz. to reach the grocers price.  If you bake yeast breads, I definitely recommend purchasing your yeast from Amazon and their partner, America Anywhere.",Best Price for a Favorite Yeast and a Wonderful Amazon Partner - America Anywhere - Made This a 5-Star Purchase ...
207730,"I absolutely adore the entire Nancy Drew series.  This edition was one of my favorites though.  The detail and beauty was so rich.  I loved exploring the nooks and crannies of this old manor.  There were definately some spooky parts that made it very thrilling.  It was more of a challenge than the others.  I had problems with a few puzzles.  Overall though,  I loved every minute of this game.  Well worth the buy.",One of my favorites.
185885,"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",Does what it needs to

165256,"Rimelda is a seer with great talent and she is sure she can help end the war. Trying to work with Prince Ander to do so, proves to be a little more challenging than she bargained for, as he doubts her abilities and there is some attraction present.

Most of this book takes place on the quest to stop the war, which keeps the adventure going. Things often happen suddenly, which spikes the tension levels, and then they would drift down to a steady pace again. Personally, I would have loved the romantic interactions to be more gradual, as they often happened out of the middle of nowhere and were very impulsive, with regrets as to the outcomes, more often than not. Prince Ander is definitely a bit frustrating!

I enjoyed the minor mysteries surrounding the quest and the surprises that crop up. The characters are fun and are not your stereotypical ones. The adventure and battles are what really drives the story to the climax. This is a great addition to a high fantasy series.

Content: violence war, talk of death and killing in nongraphic details; mild romance kissing. Clean!

I received a copy in exchange for an honest review",More of what I've come to expect from this author--great!

185037,"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years olTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",Eats Lint
40170,"I guess there will be two versions of DGD, Jonny Craig, and Kurt Travis.  Like a lot of people, I was hooked by Craig's voice and followed him to Emarosa and kind of dismissed this album and Happiness.  I came back to them in the last year and they are really fantastic and I have grown to love Kurt's voice as well.

The songs definitely get more experimental than on Downtown Battle Mountain, and that is a good thing.  They seem to have a little more fun with this release, and less aggression.  Musically, I believe they stepped it up.  They are free from pretty much all cliches and it is incredibly original.  Songs like Hot Water on Wool are just brilliant.  I also love Rock Solid, the breakdown gives me chills.

Kurt has a different approach than Jonny, less taking over the song and more fitting into it.  They also feature some guest vocals, which are terrific.  All the musicians are terrific with their instruments, meshing together better than the first album, something they have continued to do with each release.

Overall, really a unique album, well written, another great chapter by the band.",Awesome But Different

150855,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I have not had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I am only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I do not understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I am sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I do not think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I do not know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight

65085,"Easterly simply points out the fact that nothing will work across the board, and that western interventions based on appeasing the western public and economic interests does not work in all cases. In fact, it hardly works at all. He shows that specialized plans created by those who will be implementing and gaining from them are much more effective than grandoise schemes created ""planners."" This idea can be directly translated to sustainability where scientists are quickly finidng that many different solutions is the real solution. The problem most people find with this is that a he says things they do not like to hear and b some claim that he does not provide evidence of what would have happened without intervention. BUT he uses many examples such as China and Chile to in fact show this, so clearly these people just have not finished the book. He really does not say anything that can be contradicted as if there really was ""one giant plan"" to end all plans, it would be discovered from the bottom up, as equally as  the top down which I do not think would be the case at all. My only critique is that he is pretty hostile towards Sachs for an academic work, but I do not care because I think that Sachs is a pompous idiot that is needed to be knocked down a notch for a while. I think that combining Easterly's work with those of Paul Collier and the theory of Amartya Sen would be the ideal combination, but that is just me.",My favorite book on development thus far

143082,"This is my first 3D printer so I am working though some adjustments and settings for optimal printing.  I had a couple of issues but Printrbot quickly responded with a replacement part and answered questions.

From what I have seen of some 3D printing results I am getting very good results from the Printrbot metal.

The kit is fairly easy to put together, but you will need to pick up some Blue LocTite and be sure you have an assortment of Allen wrenches handy.  They included several Allen Wrenches but I still needed to dig one out of my tool collection.

The instructions are pictures with some notes on them.  There are a couple of spots where the pictures are not clear, so if that is a big concern then go with the assembled printer instead of the kit, it is only $70 more.  But building the kit will help you when you need to repair something on the printer in the future, and the Printrbot forum is very active and helpful.

I would purchase another one if I needed it.",First 3D printer

155867,"I am blown away by the number of positive reviews I have been seeing about this game.  I am starting to wonder if we are all talking about the same product.

I cannot say I actually know anything about how the game plays because I have never been able to get the program to load on my computer.  I have a brand new AMD 64 processor and a Radeon 9600 256 mb video card.  Note to the previous reviewer who actually got the game to work with older ATI drivers; that sure did not work for me.  After spending about 10 hours over two evenings installing, uninstalling, reinstalling drivers, patches, DirectX 9.0c about ten times, loading every update available for Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, and the game itself, and following every instruction from 2K to the letter, I have given up.

This game simply does not work.

I am pretty much at the point that I do not care if Fraxis comes out with a patch to fix the problems or not.  It is clear to me someone got greedy and rushed this product out about four months too early to take advantage of Christmas shoppers.  My advise would be to wait awhile before you buy this title to see if the bugs get fixed or not.

204809,"This is a nice, light cover that does a good job at keeping the rain and sun off your RV.  Caveat: this thing rips at so much as a stern glance.  The metal trigger for the awning punched 3 holes  very easily  while pulling the cover over the side.  Very frustrating.  Further, duct tape does not adhere very well to this cover, making said holes a bit of a challenge to patch.
The side straps install very easily and I really like the padded tabs with metal inserts  allowing you to bend to fit to whatever nook or ledge you find to hook them in.  I also appreciate the side zippers allowing easy door access when I go out every couple of weeks to exercise the engine and generator.
I would probably buy this again, knowing what I do now, as it is very easy to get over my 40' RV and  so far  has held up to some fairly strong wind.  I will definitely be jamming a tennis ball or something over that metal trigger as soon as possible as it continues to chew through the cover with every little breeze.","Serviceable, easy to install, easy to tear."

192080,"I have a hard time putting down a $20 flexnib fountain pen because I am so used to having to spend so much on fountain pens to get the quality I am looking for.  But in the end, this pen is a disappointment for two major reasons:

It requires too much pressure to flex.  It is not that I feel uncomfortable or it takes to much strength, it is that the force results in heavy scratching or even breaking through the paper.
It requires ""tuning"" constantly and frankly despite trying multiple of the suggestions online, I can never find a good balance between good flow when not flexing and good flow when flexing a lot.

I have tried high end flex pens from multiple sources and trust me, this is a cheap, low quality pen.  And I do not even mean that as harshly as it sounds, because it is very, very inexpensive.  It is just not fair to compare a $500 pen to a $20 pen.

But at the end of the day I need something that will write well and this is not it.  I think the folks at noodler need to come up with as cheap of a 14k flex nib as possible the softer gold is needed to get a good flex.  I bet they could do it for $75 and I would be first in line to buy it.",It's cheap alright

130866,"This pot replaced a round pasta pot that came with an ultra cheap kitchen starter set. The quality of this new pot is excellent, the heat transfer area on the bottom is sturdy and I cannot see this pot becoming misshapen like my thin, cheap older pot.
I deducted a star because it took several hand washings to stop getting purple residue in the water. Also, the oval shape of the pot leads to an awkward locking method for the lid that is not as secure as I would like. The cheap older pot was round, and the lid positively locked by inserting tabs on the rim of the pot and rotating 90 degrees. When boiling water and steam are involved, I do not want to be concerned about a lid coming loose and dumping my food in the sink or scalding me.  For the options I found when looking though, this still seems to be the best combination of quality, price, and utility.

Edit: after  several months of use, I do not recommend this pot at all. It is nearly impossible to keep the lid on when draining; I have to use oven mitts and hold the lid while trying to drain... Not something I will let my wife attempt. This is an accident waiting to happen.",Hot water death-machine (pot)

I have spent about 30 hours with it and have made several amazon review videos. It can do lots of advanced things when you want. I found the interface confusing and nonstandard. It took me 10 minutes to find ""Help."" My dislike of Corel was reinforced during the initial learning curve.

PROs:

  Very Affordable at 30 bucks
  Very few bugs so far
  Tons of capability for advanced editing

OKs:

  It sometimes freezes until you reposition the timeline window Infrequent and easily worked around.
  The online help system usually solves your questions. Sometimes not.
  Lots of effects, but mostly cheesy. Not enough tasteful transitions, for example.

CONs:

  Interface does not follow Windows conventions. Quite frustrating at first.

171053,"  I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. Getting it free has no bearing on my review. If I would have paid for it, the review would have been the same 

Little did I know that Dr. Vampyre has no vampyres in the story. It is not even a paranormal. I primarily read paranormals, and in the end it made no difference. The book held my interest and the characters were interesting and according to author, real people with the exception of the two main characters John and Ylati, bet you always wondered if authors did this.

The main character is John who has Lupus. Horrible disease, and one I knew little of before reading the story. Afterwards I have appreciation for those who suffer from the disease must go through.

I enjoyed the interaction of the characters. And how John went from someone who his disease controlled him to how he controlled him. Some of the ways that he controlled it was well interesting. Turns out some Lupus patients do drink blood, so guess it was a tiny bit of vamp to the book. And also learned something about SM. That is in the book too. The sex scenes were well written and not overdone and fit into the story line.

I like Ylati as the female lead. She was just the character to shake John up and their byplay was great. I cannot tell you too much about that, it gives the story away.

The story read easily and I finished most of it during my lunch hour. Try this story, you will enjoy it.","This is not a story about a Vampyre who's a doctor, but still give it a try"

The iBert clamps to the steer tube and turns as I turn.  It is very well centered so it does not affect my balance or steering ability.  I have not hit my knees at all.  I read that as your baby gets heavier, steering and balance may be affected.  I put a 26 pound, 2year old in there and it still did fine.  She even had growing room for her feet.  The box says up to 42"" tall.  Also, you can get extra parts from the iBert website.  I got the pad for the seat, the seat I bought here did not come with one.

As a matter of fact he was not even aware of apartheid until the early 90's. I figured I needed to read Kaffir Boy in America to find out what happened in Mark's life. It has been a huge disappointment. As one of the reviewers mentioned Mark continually pats himself on the back because he is so wonderful. I am about 75 through this book and all it has succeeded in doing is making me angry. He made stupid decison after stupid decision while living off of Stan Smith's money. He could not keep a scholarhip or stay on an athletic team because of his bad attitude. He changed undergrad colleges 4 times. Yes, Mark you have an attitude. I hope that you paid Stan back for the college education he bought you. I spent $50,000 on my education, I did not have any help. Mark quit working on a master's in journalism at Columbia University while on a full scholarship because he did not feel like finishing it. Wah, wah, wah.

43278,"I enjoyed Michael Kiwanuka's debut album, ""Home Again"" but felt that it fell short of greatness and did not quite live up to all the hype. Some terrific songs and others that sounded more like filler. But this new one, however, his second full album, is much more impressive in all respects, fulfilling the promise shown on his debut. This time around, Kiwanuka sounds more confident, the songs are stronger, and the whole package is enhanced by Danger Mouse's stellar production. From the first track to the last one, this album commands your attention.

Vocally, Kiwanuka truly sounds like he is more of his own man on this album, shedding the Bill Withersisms of the debut. Not that that was a bad thing at all  if you want to be compared to someone, Withers is a great benchmark  but his approach on this album sounds less derivative and more natural, and also much more passionate. And as good as this album is, I have a gut feeling that his next album will be even more powerful and memorable.

185709,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

Then I opened the actual case and the pieces were all Willy nilly in the case and I think things were missing as there were like 3 extra slots where it looked like tools were supposed to go.

Thicker crafting wire, where one would actually need working tools bent them side to side and would slide off and make a loud snapping noise. Do not even get me started on the sniping/cutting tools. I just had to laugh at the situation. I do not have the time or patience to send them back. Do not waste your money unless you plan on using strictly thin wire.

Its about a 21 year old girl named Jen that has a violent wake up call, and finds out she is half demon and has been specially picked for greater perpose.
Graphically this game shines, it has some of the best graphics out on PS2 I have seen, huge levels and crazy detail.
The controls are different but refreshing and new, its not like your typical 3rd person adventure.
The combat is awesome, I have not actually gotten into many fights but the ones I have gotten into are really fun, but simple.
Voice acting is superb, they seem to have chosen some great voices to put these characters together.
Music is very immersive and dark, they even play heavy metal during the fights!
I was really excited to when I saw the preview on this game, because they have not released many dark gothic games for the PS2 that shinedall...if you want to play the DMC series I would suggest the first one.

250766,"This toy is absolutely awesome. I seriously have been looking for ""Shimmer and Shine"" toys everywhere for months and had not been able to find them, much to the dismay of my 2 and 3 year old. When this came in the mail today their faces lit up like it was Christmas.

The set comes with 2 dolls and a flying carpet. You will need 3 AAA batteries to get the carpet to talk it is the carpet that talks and not actually the dolls. The dolls are very cute and well made. My daughters love playing with their hair.

Now, the reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5. My daughters cannot get the dolls seated in the ""holders"" on the carpet by themselves so now every 15 minutes or so I am hearing ""Mommy can you put her on the carpet?"" That and you have to be very careful taking the dolls out of the box which is not easy or the shoes are going to fly off and disappear. We were able to find the shoes for one doll and not the other hence one barefoot doll. They should have just painted the shoes on instead of making them removable.

Other than that this is one of the only Shimmer and Shine playsets I have been able to find and my daughters absolutely love it.",Finally a Shimmer and Shine Playset! My Daughters Love It.

Those looking for a something with more emotional depth like Danny Elfman's ""Batman"" Score, or John Williams ""Superman:TM"" soundtrack should look elsewhere.

This soundtrack served the movie very well though.  If you listen to the CD, and you have seen the movie you will probably be able to picture the scene during which a piece of music is used.

I liked it, and I am sure I will put it on from time to time over the next few months, but in all fairness, I recognize that it is probably because I enjoyed the heck out of the movie.

99237,"So far, I have tried the three varieties of Rosamonte yerba that caught my attention. The tradition, the suave and the special selection. This seems to be the best but none of them are by any means bad. I have tried a couple of other brands. Taragui comes to mind. I ordered a lot of that because it had an outstanding price for a lot of yerba and I could not pass it up. It was OK but pretty strong and I regretted it.

 After that, I just went back to Rosamonte and never looked back. I do not want to discourage yerba mate drinkers from experimenting but if you are going to do it, always order in small amounts until you know what you like. Believe it or not, everything about yerba mate can vary dramatically from one brand to the next and it sucks to have a bunch of yerba mate on hand that you are not that fond of. And it is not cheap when you pretty much have to order it.

 Anyway, the Rosamonte Seleccion Especial. I love the extra smoky flavor. I use cream and sweetener and it mingles perfectly. Nice thing about yerba mate is it seems to be perfect for experimentation. Add a little lemon or mint flavor and it tastes like it was meant to be.",My favorite so far.

27857,"I have gone through more bead storage options that I care to remember.  A lot of it was great on  paper, but ineffective in reality.

These have a several  good things going for them.  First, I just love the rounded bottoms.  Do you know what it is like having a crimp  bead on the bottom of a flat container?  These rounded bottoms save  a lot of aggravation.  Secondly,  the tops fit  tight to the dividers.  No more mixed colors.  Thirdly is that a word?  is the fixed compartments.  Why is that good?  well, because, despite the best intentions, the adjustable compartment dividers NEVER sit flat enough to keep tiny items from sneaking in from one compartment to the next.  Finally, you can stack them.  While they are not  interlocking so one will not keep the next from falling They do sit flat on top of the one beneath.

So what would I change?  Well,  I would like them to stack tighter.  Not necessarily locking, but a protrusion that fit into the next would be good.  I would also like  fixed compartments of different sizes for such stuff as three inch long eyepins.  I currently use an adjustable organizer for my eyepins/headpins and guess what they do.....yup....they slide underneath the divider into the compartment next door.  so Darice, if you are listening....same concept, more sizes please!",I need a hundred more!

42237,"Busdriver is an incredibly agile MC who I believe can somehow fit 1000 syllables in a mere 16 bar verse. I came across this album not too long ago thanks to a couple suggestions from music websites. Even though this album was made over a decade ago, it turns out that I actually heard one of his songs ""Imaginary Places"" in a video game long ago. I find it almost criminal to not have found this album until now, but I guess its better late then never. The album is incredible from the complex flow delivered from Busdriver himself, to his relatable lyrics to the hybrid production with a mix of early 90's boom bap with Jazz and funk samples. The album is a treat for underground Hip Hop fans alike and an underrated Hip Hop albums overall.

10809,"The Jouer Essential Lip Enhancer makes two claims:

1.  it is an ultra rich lip moisturizer protects lips from environmentally damaging elements while hydrating and volumizing to provide lasting results; and
2.  it naturally increases the fullness of your lips while decreasing fine lines.

In my use of this Jouer product, I found that the lip enhancer, with a consistency thicker than a standard lip gloss, does a great job moisturizing my lips and works as a nice base layer for a tinted lip product.  However, as a lip enhancer and/or volumizer, the Jouer product is a bust.  I did not see any difference in my lips other than they kept moisturized for a slightly longer period of time than a standard lip gloss.

For the price, this is a pretty good deal even w/ the occasional flag gear reset issue.  I had originally bought a toner refill kit from another vendor and found it to be a messy operation.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",Worked like a charm

209822,"Cyberlink's Power DVD is a pretty well known name in video playback programs, and for good reason.  It does what it is supposed to well and has a wide range of features.  There are good number of screens to move through in Power DVD 11, but the interface is fairly intuitive and not all that difficult to navigate.

My only major gripe with the arrangement is how the full screen option is set up.  Selecting the full screen option does not actually change the interface to full screen  instead it keeps navigation bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  It took me awhile fiddling around with the software to figure out you have to switch from ""Classic"" mode to ""Cinema"" mode to get real full screen, which is annoyingly unnecessary.

Power DVD 11 has a dizzying array of options and will play pretty much any video file format, but it seems like only a very small percentage of serious videophiles will actually need or use all the extras.  Cutting right to the chase, you probably do not need this program unless you really want to watch Bluray in 3D while being able to play videos from your iPhone and upload clips to Youtube or Facebook.  For those who just want to watch movies or view photos, there are already dozens of cheap or free options readily available that are more than up to the job.","Mixed bag - lots of features, but will you actually use them?"

185039,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

59597,"We built a dedicated theater in our basement and had some problems with the bass.  First my big receiver was not putting out any signal for the subwoofer channels.  Annoying, but then fixed itself, I assume with a firmware update.  Right after that, one of my subs died, inexplicably.  Fuse was still good but it is dead.  So I considered a few options, with an infinite baffle sub being one.  I could relatively easily set one up under the risers for the theater seating, but I was concerned about the rattles, etc, associated with that.  And the theater is beneath our two girls' bedrooms, so I did not want to keep them up. Ultimately I decided that I would buy two of these F12s and replace the two smaller subs I already had in the room.  The price was right so I bought two and got them quickly.  Set up is very easy and adjustments were similarly so.

I am not a theater novice, so I put in my standby demo of the Matrix lobby shooting scene, followed by the helicopter scenes, culminating with the very large explosion of the helicopter into the building.  I have always suspected there was more to this explosion, but had not heard it anywhere else, so I was not sure.  Now I am sure I have been missing the depth that these F12s can provide.  Holy cow, the house was rocking.  I am a very happy camper today and I expect to watch many more action movies in my theater now.  But only during the waking hours...",Here comes the BOOM!

163379,"I have been reading Entertainment Weekly for about twenty years now, and although it is gone through a lot of changes, it is basically still my favorite magazine to receive and to read. It is a sort of a good mix of pop culture plus a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the ""interesting"" kind, meaning you will not find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.

The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.

The only thing I do not like about the magazine is that it is starting to get very web and tablet focused meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there is a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I am not happy about this I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I am not happy that now it is four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It is the same for books and television and other media, as well.

Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"". I love that I know about every movie, television show, and CD before they even get released.","slimmer than it used to be, but still an invaluable source of entertainment info"
208233,"This really is not a photo editor, it more of an enhancer.  It will make pictures look their natural best without much of a learning curve to the software.  If you are a student or just dove into a new camera, and starting to lose track of your collection, it is also a great organization tool.

Though it is light on features, it is great for a quick fix, and even if you screw something up, it is okay, as it keeps a copy of the original file you pulled. If you like the enhancement, and want to keep making new versions, your original will still be there.

The software is quite intelligent with intuitive capability that will pull the data from your images, even older ones, and use the correct tools for that camera.  The organizational aspects of this is spot on.  With the information of each shot immediately available, files are much easier to sort as it begins to do that for you.

I keep two external drives for my photos.  One drive as the ""master"" source, and the other is a backup of my backup.  The software works just fine with the drives.

People will compare this to Lightroom and Photoshop etc., but those programs require a bit more skill and patience.  And they have many more features.  But for the money, it is a pretty good buy for a simple easy to use tool to clean up your collection without worries.",Keep track of your growing collection without risk of losing shots

215198,"Antivirus and spyware programs offer some of the choicest morsels in the freeware phenomenon.

 This program is typical of its commercial genre: big, slow and a resource hog. Antivirus and spyware programs should be left to run t night or whenever else you are not using the computer.

 I do not have any kind of formal procedure for testing spyware programs. I run a commercial antivirus and spyware package and occasionally run freeware programs to see how each performs against the others. PCTools Spyware Doctor is not perfect when measured against competitors. It did not miss anything on my pretty clean system, nor did it find anything the others did not. Identifying actual malware from entities such as legitimate Registry entries and Cookies is as tedious as it is with other programs and not as bad as some others. The great danger of these programs is that for many users, they are dangerous weapons  it is very simple to delete a critical Registry entry.

 Overall, I think experienced users would probably be just as happy  if not happier  with one of the well known freeware products. Inexperienced users might be better served with a better featured program that includes antivirus capabilities.

You also assign routes, waypoints and rules of engagement to each platoon avoid or attack. The controls in mission are ok but until you get the last MS I forgot the name you do not have very much in the way of mobility. The fact that your MS's have paper thin armor does not help the situation any.

Another problem I have often had with them is that they end up looking brownish instead of properly red. Come to Bed Red is different. To me, its the perfect red, a true red that is not pink, is not Brown, and is not neon. I get a lot of compliments on my long, natural nails and part of how I keep them from getting damaged is to apply many layers of this, which creates a thick finish that is surprisingly durable, often lasting several days with little to no tip wear and zero chipping. One complaint I have is that I have found BL polishes take a very long time to dry, but the fact that the polish is thick and that I apply many layers overall probably worsens that. Also, it is frustrating that it seems to get thicker as you use the bottle up. Even so, I love it and repurchase again and again in this colour.",Come to Bed Red recommended!

There are a few reviews on here complaining about the camera angles and some other small petty issues... and they have been giving this game 13 stars. And i must admit... there are some occassions where i will get frustrated with the camera but i still do not find enough reason to give it anything below a 4 star if anything.

If there is one reason to buy a Wii... Mario Galaxy should be it.

The reasons i gave it a 4 star... maybe even a 4.5:

1 Difficulty settings are set way to easy. I understand that this meant for the younger generation but i wish they had a difficulty option. I also know that difficulty options never existed in mario games but... i am totally flying through this game and the fun i am experiencing right now is soon to end!!!!! nooSurprisedSurprisedSurprisedSurprisedSurprisedoo!

2 Camera Angles. Difficult to deal with at some points, and the camera locks at the oddest times.

3 I wish we had more opportunities to enjoy the Bee and Boo outfits..etc.

4 I wish luigi had a bigger role. I know this is a Mario game... but still.

5 And of course... the Wii is all about fun... i understand that... but.. PLEASE PLEASE!!!... Nintendo!!... upgrade the graphics!! You can still do the whole GREAT INNOVATION route... but you can do that with great graphics as well.

The last Mario i really... really... really enjoyed was Mario 64. And this game just brought all those great memories back and has to be one of the greatest games out right now... hands down.

70411,"In a crowded Delhi marketplace in 1996, a ""small"" bomb is detonated, killing several people. Among the dead are 2 young brothers. Their friend, a Muslim, survives the blast. What follows in this short but brilliant book is the aftermath of the explosion on the lives of those involved. The Khuranas are dealing with the death of their boys, which serves to reveal cracks in their seemingly strong relationship. Surviving boy Mansoor grapples with the physical and psychological injuries it has inflicted on him. His parents struggle to help him and their friends whose sons were killed, as Mansoor begins to associate with groups fighting for the rights of his fellow Muslims in the country. We also learn the fates and motivations of the 2 men who detonated the bomb, and follow one of Mansoor's new friends as he descends from someone fighting for social justice into radicalization. Grief permeates the novel, with some form of it affecting the decisions of everyone involved. Understandably this means this is a very sad story. But it is a necessary one. There are many books that tackle mourning or the loss of a child, so that aspect, while excellently handled, is not really anything new. Very rarely does anyone succeed in really getting inside the heads of terrorists though, instead opting to portray them as cartoonishly evil. Not so here. While not in away condoning or glorifying their actions, it does make the reader understand them, and shows how frighteningly easy it is to turn people into one. This is a gripping tale that is deserving of the many accolades it has received and is easily one of the year's best books.",One of 2016's best books.

Small enough not to be bulky on my countertop, big enough to make a manyingredient smoothie for one person, and it has enough engine to easily crunch ice without having to rework the ice to the bottom. The tops fit nice and snug, so no worries about spills while driving!  And it is so nice to have two containers, so one can be soaking while the other is in use. I wish it came in black with the two containers, but being available only in white is a small price to pay for a product I am very happy with. FYI, I have had this for one month with almost daily use.",Very Happy

I made a carrot wine, and decided to use a juicer instead of slicing and soaking in sugar to extract the juices.  Using a juicer also extracts the pectin.  I was going to deal with a cloudy wine since it will taste the same anyway.  I added a teaspoon of this Pectic Enzyme to every gallon of my mash, and to my surprise, it worked!  I had a very thick and cloudy wine after the first racking, but now that the wine has had its second racking and has been fermenting for nearly three months, it is a beautiful clear orange color, with no cloudy qualities to note!  Now that I am a believer, I use it in all of my white or lighter colored wines, and no matter the extraction method I use, I am getting a nice, clear wine a few months later.",I have unclouded fruit/veggie wines!

3658,"Very poorly crafted.  The outer iron frame is very rough and uneven, the three piece screw together stake one uses to place the plaque into the ground has so out of line threads that it was very difficult to get them to screw together, the black paint used on the frame is very unevenly applied to the point there are some places you can see bare metal.  The worst thing is that when the tile was being placed inside the metal holder, so much thick presumably glue has been used that when the tile was pressed into the frame a lot of the glue was pressed out along the edges of the tile and up onto the printed tile itself as well as onto the black frame.  Instead of cleaning the excess gunk off of both the frame and the tile, it was just left there to dry.  Very poor quality standard to say the least.  This item is WAY OVERPRICED given the sloppy assembly, poor painting and the cheap, rough unfinished quality of metal used.  Cannot recommend this product.  Caveat Emptor!",Not worth the price

I can play my ROKUTV with or w/o the soundbar and one or the other of these and unless I just want to shake the windows and rattle the doors and maybe annoy my neighbors in the next house over I do not need to use my stereo at all.

These are significantly louder than the soundbar and spread the sound out more.  If you put them together with the soundbar they flood the entire living room with sound without the overall volume getting too high.  They are usually all I need, without the soundbarbut having more speakers playing at the same volume below maximum still helps to overcome other background noise that could cause one to miss bits of dialog, etc.  Great purchase.

109295,"This is a strange one. An Alfred Hitchcock movie that is absolutely anonymous. In fact, Hitchcock made a couple of forays outside the thriller genre and both were very poor. ""Under Capricorn"" is a kitchen sink, tearjerker and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" is, ostensibly, a screwball comedy. The problem is Hitchcock does not understand the screwball format and the pace is slow and the jokes unfunny. Montgomery is badly miscast as the obnoxious husband, and his asides and grimaces make it seem like he has a bad case of constipation. Lombard is, as always, good, but she cannot do much with this material. Did I mention that the screenplay is also extremely poor? The thing just does not hold together. On the one hand, Montgomery is so stupid he does not mention the fact of the illegal marriage to Lombard until it is too late we never learn the reason for his reticence. On the other hand, Lombard who has been desperately waiting for Montgomery to tell her about the unofficial marriage though she already knowsthen becomes completely unforgiving of someone we have previously been led to believe she loves deeply.

I have used many different types of PLA and once I find an ideal temperature for the different brands of PLA I get amazing prints.  I have been printing nonstop since Christmas and would like to buy another one, to keep up with business, but Amazon tells me that it will be 35 months for delivery.  I had been using a Davinci printer which I must say I am glad to be rid of...  The proprietary PLA that xyz printing forces you to use for a very expensive price is just crap.  I used to buy other PLA and spin the XYZ PLA off and replace it will better PLA.  Glad to have this new QIDI printer.

So far I am completely satisfied.  I am kind of new to 3D printing but this printer was easy to setup and configure.  I did download the latest Makerbot software to slice my 3d models.  It prints faster than some of the other printers in the same price range.  I use IXCC PLA for most prints at 200C with the platform at 40C.  I use Elmer's washable school glue stick on the print platform.",Working Great.

41381,"Bob Ezrin played Phil Spector on this one...a departure from what preceded it, Destroyer pissed off some of the KISS Army, yet steadily brought in a wider fanbase. From the tragic narration of a drunk driver in Detroit Rock City,the songs just open up with denser melodic textures. The slowpaced yet heavy God Of Thunder...deep cuts like Flaming Youth and Sweet Pain and of course...Beth, the first KISS ballad. Ironically the Peter Criss crooned tune was what saved this album from burying KISS after succeeding with Alive, unlike Peter Frampton when he sought to follow up on his famous live album. There are early signs of bad things to come though, such as not every member of the original band played throughout the entire record, or Ezrin buddy/session guitarist Dick Wagner doing the solo on Sweet Pain, but the finished product is not the worse for it.

So, I exportedQB data into a Window version, loaded the file on my old PC and continued working. Every year for the last seven years or so I have used Quick Books and Turbotax to prepare and file my business taxes. Every year the QB balance sheet never matched imported balance sheet data in TurboTax. Although the Federal Government does not need the Balance Sheet, the New York requires it. So, I ignored that the Balance Sheet data were not matching and filed the taxes. If New York State wants a Balance Sheet, I will mail the one printed from my QB.

130790,"Bought for my daughter's first waitressing job. Thick, tough, quality material. Seams sewn tightly. Ties sewn firmly.
She loves it. As a former bartender, who has gone through many aprons, I can tell this is a great quality apron that
should last a long time. Deep rich very jet black. Not that cheap looking grayish black or medium black color.
Initially she was concerned that it was too 'long'. That it would hang down too far on her thighs and not ""look cool"".
She is 5'7"", medium framed, her waist at the normal area on her body, and the bottom of the apron hits her just a shade
below her crotch area. Sorry about the ""too much information"". The pockets are large and deep so her order pad and pens
do not fall out or stick up so much they poke her in the stomach if she bends over. And on occasion, depending on how she
flips down the top a bit then ties it, she can make it hit her higher up on her body. But she rarely does that.
She loves it the way it is.
Highly recommend.

UPDATE JULY 15, 2012:
Have washed this apron numerous times and it is still a deep black. No fading. Also, no fray's, strings or tears. Holding
up extremely well. Still looks like it came out of the package yesterday. Would buy this apron before any other! Excellent.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

57430,"I have owned previous Livescribes, and used them for awhile. The were fun at first, but later proved less useful. They usually worked by synching them a computer and downloading the notes you took along with the text you wrote. You could tape on a word in your notes, and have the Livescribe replay them at that  synchronized moment.

The problem was that, in the end, typing was faster for me than handwriting. It was easier to take notes on the computer, than write them by hand and then transfer them over.

This new Livescribe seeks to transfer your writing in real time to your tablet or phone. However, it did not always work. Moreover, if I wanted to transfer my scribing over to an electronic device, it would probably be a laptop, not a tablet. You may feel differently.

After the text appears on your tablet, you can swipe over it to do a few thing  transcribe it into computer text, dial a telephone number, etc. However, I could not find any way to convert all of the text at one time  it seemed possible only one line at a time. This was somewhat tedious.

In some ways, I give LIvescribe credit for trying to develop new technologies and leverage existing ones. But I am still not sure they solve a problem I have. When I want to write, I write, when I want to type, I type. I just do not find myself needing an ability to do both concurrently, with mixed results at that.",The least useful Livescribe yet

108682,"It demonstrates the horrors of battle and the incredible courage that common soldiers have to summon in battle.  It also demonstrates the ego and stubbornness that high command sometimes displays by insisting that its grunt soldiers succeed in executing a flawed battle plan rather than reexamine their own thinking.  The story line is mostly about a young man determined to stay alive, and makes good battlefield decisions to protect his own life.  This gets the attention of his command, and he is put in a squad leader, and then a platoon leader position which is the last thing he wants.  The movie gives a very ambivalent portrayal of this young man.  Is he a villain who would sacrifice his comrades to save himself, or is he a hero with an innate sense of battlefield tactics that ultimately saved many lives in this battle.

I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift.

I tried Kaspersky Pure as well but it was difficult to remove when I decided to use Internet Security the next year.  I understand that the difference between Kaspersky AntiVirus and Internet Security is that the latter has a second firewall.  I do not notice performance issues using the Internet Security, so I will stick with it.  Be prepared for numerous banner alerts weeks before your version will expire, which is annoying, but I suppose other antivirus and Internet Security makers do this as well.

My daughter accidentally downloaded some malware one day clicking on ""your computer is infected"" links from a compromised website and Kaspersky emailed me instructions on its removal.

183811,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

The printer warned me that it was not HP ink but, after pressing OK, it went about initializing the cartridge.  While printing the first document after installing the cartridge, the printer stopped 1/2 way through the page and I got a warning message on my computer telling me that HP would not be responsible for damage caused by the nonHP ink.  After closing the warning page, the printer completed printing.  The printer accessory software has 'flagged' the cartridge with a warning triangle now too but no other harassment as of now.  If the other cartridges work as well as the first, I will be a VERY happy customer.

Update:  The 3 color cartridges are now installed and working fine as of 3/16/2017",First 3 cartridges work fine
14666,"Wow  this eye serum is fantastic.  From the very first application, it works well to tighten the skin around my eyes and give it a silky texture.  Even better, my extremely sensitive skin tolerates it well enough for me to use it every day.

The applicator takes a few tries to get used to, mostly because it needs to be primed.  You also must pull on the trigger and then sweep the wand over your skin.  At first, I tried to expel the eye treatment by pressing it against my skin.  Ouch.  The serum glides on effortlessly.  You can feel the tingle within seconds.

I like that Juice Beauty uses organic and natural ingredients to improve the look of the delicate skin around the eye.  It is soothing, brightening, and tightening, all without irritation.

184003,"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",Does what it needs to

40946,"I can remember years ago when I first got into Pearl Jam when 10 was their only album. That album was filled with energy and inspiration that I have rarely heard on an album. Songs like Once convey a sense of raw power while songs like Alive and Jeremy have a strong emotional attachments to them. Vs continued this tradition with songs like animal and go having that raw power and W.M.A and elderly women have that emotional attachments. However with vitology, the band began try things which is good but sadley the execution of that expirementation did not sound as good as their previous works. No Code sadley follows that tradition. It is difficult to listen to because of its unfinished sound. Songs like Hail Hail seem like they would have been good if Pearl Jam had worked more on the song. In the end, No Code fails to make a connectin that is strong with listeners.",the downfall of what once a great band

I should have known by past experiences with Black  Decker drills not to buy one but the fancy 'Smart Select' feature had me sold. As soon as I got it I noticed that it was not very powerful nor very 'smart'. I never could get the right setting, even though there are pretty little pictures all around the chuck illustrating each setting. Even for simple around the house jobs this drill was too weak. If I had to drive a screw through anything thicker than a piece of plywood it would struggle. Finally while drilling a hole through a twobyfour it crapped out on me.

It is true that there is a wee bit of a breakin period for the material that is in between the toes.

Whether or not they actually help you to ""toneup""; I do not know.
They are soooo comfortable that I do not really care whether or not they assist in toning.
I love the cushion that that these sandals provide. In the past, I have rarely worn flipflop style sandals due to plantar fasciitis. These sandals are not only cute.....they prevent my feet from taking a pounding.
I even wear them at home while walking on the treadmill.
If the price is a barrier; watch for clearance styles. The first pair that I purchased was from JcPenney for $9.95 and the second pair that I have just ordered through Amazon came to only $22.00, including the shipping costs.

219980,"Picking this grill was not easy.  I was replacing a 10 year old CookOn grill from BBQ Galore and wanted something similar as far as cooking ability and sturdiness.  Unfortunately, upon researching grills for weeks, it seems that there is a huge gap between ""low priced"" grills and ""high end"" grills. Out of the box, expect about 2 hours putting it together.  Everything fits well and it is easy to put together.  Fit and finish are good, the only complaint I have is that it is difficult to fit the stainless shelves into the frames without scratching the powder finish  no big deal.  I am completely satisfied.

Pros:
Easy assembly, although it requires almost full assembly.
Everything fits nice, main components such as burners already assembled.
Decent price for the quality
Lit immediately and gets hot very fast.
Very even heating  performance is excellent

Cons:
Knob placement is strange.  If you use the sideburner, you will have almost no room on the shelves  why not place the dials up front?  I guess they want you to move up to the Summit Series?
 Accessory hooks are kind of recessed and large so they will not fit all utensils.  Maybe the Weber ones fit?",Impressive performance

47635,"Given the Dio/Blackmore combination and the sound of the other Rainbow records of this era, you would expect this to be a really heavy hard rock album, but its not.  I think Blackmore was still suffering a funk hangover  from the last two Purple records which infects some of this, keeping it  from rocking as hard as it ought to and making this the weakest of the  albums with Ronnie James Dio.  Actually, if you listen to  ""Stormbringer"" and ""Rainbow Rising"", its easy to see  this as a transitional record between the two.
That said, Blackmore is in  great form here and the songs are generally pretty good.  The only complete  stinker is ""If You Do not Like Rock 'n' Roll"".  This is a good  record, just lacking the expected heaviness and aggression.  ""Man On  The Silver Mountain"" and ""Sixteenth Century Greensleeves""  are great songs, but these original versions barely hint at the power they  would have live.
I read somewhere that Blackmore originally wanted Purple  to cover ""Black Sheep Of The Family"", but the rest of the band  refused.  Apparently, they were more interested in playing garbage like  ""High Ball Shooter"" and ""Holy Man"".  Not that  ""Black Sheep"" is all that great, but it is better than most  everything on ""Stormbringer"".",Blackmore in transition

153821,"Some things are just better off being left in 2D.  Anyone familiar with the Castlevania series at all knows this to be fact, as Konami's attempts to bring the long running series to the realm of 3D have just fallen flat.  Now we get a Castlevania fighting game do not ask why with Castlevania Judgment for the Wii, which even though it says it is a Castlevania game, is really a generic fighting game with little personality to it to seperate it from the rest of the pack.  There is a decent roster of fighters that Castlevania fans will recognize, such as Simon Belmont, Alucard, and even Dracula; but there is not much variation or real differences between most of the fighters.  The fighting system appears to offer some depth, but it really is not anything you have not seen countless times before.  The game does not look too bad though, and there is some great music as well, but there just is not enough here that helps the game stand out on its own.  All in all, Wii owners who are Castlevania fans and/or fighting game fans may want to give Castlevania Judgment a look, but other than that, your time is better off served elsewhere.",Generic fighter that leaves much to be desired

We found this stuff at Amazon and took a chance on it a big chance because it is six boxes!, and man, is it great. It cooks, serves, eats, and tastes virtually identical to standard wheatbased pasta, and in fact it appears to have less tendency to stick together or get soft and squishy in sauces or when reheated.

In fact, at this point, even if FODMAP was not an issue we would probably use this stuff as our primary macaroni. Highly recommended.

Also, for anybody out there who is avoiding gluten because of digestive issues but find it does not work 100 of the time, investigate FODMAP as an option.

She moves to Tokyo to continue her nursing career and learns about mysterious deaths and she tries to find the source of the deaths. All I can remember about this film is the stupid looking child who once he opens his mouth and you are witness to it, you die. We find out the child is a ghost who died a terrible death and now is seeking revenge. No blood, no gore, not scary and overall disappointing. I hope they do not plan to make The Grudge 2.

67373,"I absolutely loved this book. I think I am finally going to start reading fiction regularly again now that I have tried a couple of Japanese authors. Japanese writers seem to demand more of their readers than American authors do. If you are looking for a typical storyline, this book is definitely not the one you want to choose. There are three entirely separate stories with different protagonists and physical contexts. One is even set fifty years before the other two.  Murakami alternates between these three stories, picking up where he left off with each one at the beginning of the chapters. Eventually it becomes only two stories, but all the plots do not converge until near the end of the book.

Also, I am beginning to see that some Japanese authors seem to share the predilection of many Japanese animated filmmakers when they use the superstitious beliefs embedded in historical folk tales as plot devices to move the story forward in unusual and sometimes seemingly ambiguous ways. There are parts in the latter half of this book where it is never clearly explained where physical reality ends and the realm of daydreams begins. The reader simply has to sketch out both possibilities in his mind and enjoy sucking the marrow out of the themes that would be implied by both options.","A sublime, if a bit surreal, novel"
32101,I have quite a lot of classic 60s Motown in my various playlists. I kept hearing this song and eventually bought it. I do not know if this is a new lyric but it is sung exceptionally well by Rihanna. The music is wellscored but the production is a bit bass heavy. When I play it next to original Motown classics it is clearly a homage but do not let that spoil a great song.,Beautiful voice and a great homage to 60s Motown.

I decided to get the PS3 because i am a type of person that likes to own all the consoles. PS3 did not strike me as a system that was going to smash all competition like everything makes it to be. I got the 20gb and ran a 25"" $15 Ethernet wire. It worked out perfect. I do not miss anything the 60gb had to offer. Wireless is not the best. Lost a signal is very upsetting. I do not save any music or video on my PS3 HDD since i can use an external hard drive and share it with the Xbox. Also the PS3 HDD is easily upgradeable. The graphics are better than the Xbox 360 because it shows a little more details. Not a major difference. Games display in only 720p just like the 360. If you have a 360 and love it, I would recommend sticking with it till the PS3 goes down in price. You are not missing much.","Not Better, But Equal"

71844,"A possible reason why reviews of this book are so divergent is that BRUNELLESCHI'S DOME is so much more than an architectural triumph that for some it seems unlikely that such a slim book by a journalist could do it full justice. Ross King however fully recognizes the significance of the dome of the Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral and the mastery of it is creator Filippo Brunelleschi. He pays tribute to how both the man and his creation were symbolic of the great creative genius that we have come to see as typifying the golden age of the Renaissance. King also clearly shows how such individuals and their work were a boon to the continuing growth and influence of the Renaissance as a whole. Not only is the dome a wonderful architectural triumph  at 143 feet in diameter it is still the largest dome in existence  the very act of creating it spurred other developments. Construction techniques, machines and tools, methods of organizing work, architectural design and drafting; all had to be modified, improved, and in some cases newly invented to accomplish the goal.
Any reading you do on the Renaissance will be sure to mention southern Italy and the pioneering role Florence had in the movement. With Florence you are dealing with the finest sculpture, painting, and architecture, and with Brunelleschi's dome you have got distilled into one creation all that the Renaissance stood for.","""il Duomo"" as icon of an age"

In my day our toys were just generic Barbies that said a phrase or two when you pulled her hair. That is not entirely true, but I just cannot get over the great quality and incredible versatility of Sofia the First in comparison to the toys of yore. I have only heard the show as I walk past the television, so I do not know much about Sofia and her pal Clover, but I do know an amazing toy set when I see one, and this is amazing.

Sofia and Clover come with an adorable tea set/picnic and the entire set is fantastically detailed. From Clover to the blanket, everything is wellmade with lots of depth and detailing. And depending on your configuration, the set can say somewhere around 40 phrases, which is stunning in my opinion.

Sofia herself is gorgeous in her big pink dress and hat can I get a hat like that? and most of her picnic fits nicely in the basket. Sofia requires 3 AAA batteries your first set is included and even after a week of play, she has not slowed down. If you are balking at the price seems kind of high for a doll and a tea set let me assure you, she is well worth the cost.

NO Venting channels to allow air to flow into the garbage can making liners easier to lift out of the trash can. As a result, when you pull the full garbage bag out of this pail, it creates a vacuum and the bags are difficult to pull out of the pail. Dumb design. Rubbermaid has venting channels.
NO Integrated cinches that allow bags to be attached to handles so that the bag does not fall into the pail.

46355,"Everything has been said. All I can add is that Days of the New just got better as they went along. Why they are not world renown comercially successful superstars I just do not know. I say ""comercially"" because in my book they are superstars with or without the enormous fortune and fame. I could name dozens of bands in the same position. That does not make them any less great. Especially II and then even more so is III. They are just adventures in music that you will only hear from DOTN. I can pop these discs in and I never want them to stop. Their music is complex. You will hear more every time you listen to them. It is mature, not particularly for the kids. Perhaps there in lies the rub. Great mature music that does not appeal to the preteen with all mommy and daddy's money. Certainly that would be simplifiying. But, to a degree I believe this is what happens when you do not sell out. When you create with integrity first, getting rich second. At least they have earned respect and this band will be talked about now and then for as long as rock music is being played and when the nu metal sorry ass crowd becomes a pathetic joke like disco did.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",Eats Lint

Basically if you know you want to upgrade to Windows 8, then you can rest assured that this is a good way to do it assuming you are on Windows 7 to begin with.

If you hate Windows 8's guts, then you will not be interested in this to begin with. Personally I have been hoping that 8.1 would resolve the issues, but so far that is sounding like only a partial solution. I can survive in Windows 8, but on a desktop system it is a struggle to get used to the ""tablet style"" user interface that it forces on you each time you want to start a program. Fortunately there are 3rd party addons that will restore the Start button and bypass the Metro UI at startup.

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Being fond of herbal waters, this has been terrific with sprigs of herbs and lemon or cucumber slices. Usually I use basil, but fresh rosemary lends an interesting twist, especially with peaches.
Of course, fruits are probably most popular.
Luckily, the inner chamber can hold a lot of fruit! Fill it up, staggering raspberries or strawberries with fresh basil in between, it is so pretty, as well as tasty.

I hand wash it carefully, using only a microfiber cloth and dish soap. I know from experience that plastics like this scratch easily.

As a mass produced soap it is actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula and I have some sensitive skin.

The pencil itself writes okay, it is a little thin and easy to break though.  And the fact that it does not have an eraser sealed the negative review.  I know a drafting pencil probably is not going to have an eraser, but as an accounting student the eraser is pretty important to me, especially with such an expensive pencil.  Over all quality of the pencil is good, I just probably will not use it more than the once or twice I have used it.",it's a little thin and easy to break though

72800,"For the first quarter of this book, I did not really care for it much and wondered how this novel could have been so acclaimed. The style was so spare and stark, and the story not all that interesting as it got started. But I am not one to quit reading a book, and I am glad I stuck with it. I found that Coplin's writing style became more interesting and richer as the story unfolded, and as life became more interesting for the orchardist. There is much to admire in this book: the complexity of the characters as you get to know them and as their lives become more complicated; the interactions of the characters or their very failures to interact and the lost opportunities that result; the depiction of life at that time in our American history. My early frustration with a sparse writing style and slowdeveloping story turned into admiration for Coplin's story line and literary ability. I recommend this book.",Highly recommended in spite of a slow start

It is a bit awkwardly large and would have been better cut in half and delivered as a twopack, but my larger problem is with the scent. It does have a vague lime scent to it, but that is not the main scent. I really cannot identify the main scent, and I am confused about whether it is supposed to be masculine or feminine. It is not a typical sweet fruity smell like I would expect with lime and pomegranate which, by the way, I do not smell at all it is a more unisex, gardenish thing.

Hearts of Fire picks right up after Essie and Aiden have slept together.  Afterwards, Essie panics and shoots out of Aidens house.  For the past 5 years, keeping track of him and planning on bringing him down has been her sole focus, but now things are more complicated.  Aiden has been taking care of Essie from afar also.  After avoiding Aiden, he finally gives her no choice but to go on date with him.  Both Aiden and Essie are confused by their feelings but Aiden comes to term with his feelings long before Essie does.  Essie runs off to think; Aiden gives her this but eventually his patience wears out and he goes to find her and confess his feelings.

I will admit, that I have not read the first book in this series. It took me a while to establish what was going on.  After I finally figured out the foundation of what started in Hearts Revenge, the book was okay.  The writing was solid but I thought it was lackingit went on for quite a while; Are they going to be together or not?

44267,"This is the last Beatles album before they really got serious with their  music. And the four big songs Help, You have Got To Hide Your Love Away,  Ticket To Ride, and Yesterday show it. These four songs are of the highest  caliber, and their inclusion on the album automatically makes this an  essential part of any Beatles collection.
And do not worry, there is some  great stuff here to help complement the four big ones. The Night Before,  You are Going To Lose That Girl, I have Just Seen A Face, and Dizzy Miss  Lizzie are all great songs. A really entertaining listen.
This album  would easily be 5 stars if not for the amazingly uneven feel to it. The  Harrison songs are complete throw aways and Act Naturally has absolutely no  business being on a Beatles album.
Should people buy this? Most  definetely. Although, if you really want only the bare essentials, and you  already have the Red Album, then and only then should you even consider  not getting this to complete your Beatles collection.","Some amazing, some bad."

It is a highly regulated process.  When she and her partner, Will, need to investigate illegal attacks on humans called ""blooding"", they are assigned to a vampire prince who swears a lot.  He is the ""bad mouth"" of the title.
Val and the Prince, Kade, go on a series of interviews with vampires who have witnessed the bloodings.  At first, Kade let us Val conduct the interviews without assisting her, but by the third interview, he is pressing the vampire she questions for more details, and using his royal authority for results to help Val.  The vampires would like their activities to stay under the radar and as unregulated as possible, and the rogue vampires undermine their interests.  So Kade wants answers, too.

54945,"This thing is pretty amazing. Bought it for the wife for Christmas to go in the kitchen/den. Connected instantly to her iPad Air 2 with no issues whatsoever. The battery lasts an unbelievably long time between charges. It came fully charged out of the box and after playing an hour or two here and there a few times a week we literally did not plug it in to recharge until sometime well into February.

My only complaint is that the sound is not quite as full as I was hoping for, but considering the actual size it is smaller than you think it is pretty amazing that it sounds as good as it does. If you are looking for floorshaking bass, look elsewhere and spend a lot more. If you just want reasonably roomfilling sound from a reliable, compact, portable unit, I highly recommend this.

Definitely check the boxes and the expiration dates. Hey...you never know it may be a hit in the future, chocolate covered maggots like ever heard of chocolate ants.

Living in a place where peaches are grown and where there is an annual peach festival in our town, we have become discerning about the taste of peaches.  This peach tea has an authentic peach taste.

Not only does it satisfy our desire for a peach taste when peaches are unavailable; it gives us a little kick.  We like the sweet taste without all the calories too.  We consider this tea a winner.

Ingredients are maltodextrin, citric acid, instant tea, natural and artificial peach flavor, aspartame sweetener. It disolves easily.

I hope you find this review helpful.",Excellent Peach Flavor

 Product Pros: Great blanced taste, ethically sourced, 2 pounds
 Cons to Consider: Not a resealable bag
  My overall thoughts on the product: I use to be a barista and have tried many types of coffee from all around the world including the one made from bat droppings. This coffee stands up there with the best of them and has earned a space on my shelf next to the top brands. I have made this in the fast drip coffee maker as well as the slow methods and enjoyed both of them. To get the full earthy stong tone flavor profile you will need to open this up by brewing slowly. Brewing fast makes a great normal coffee that is fine on its own without the full flavor notes. The price is on par for supporting ethical growing and picking of this. Overall I am pleased with this coffee brand that I have never heard of before and recommend giving them a shot if you have not either. I will continue to use the product and update if any updates are warranted that you should know that I may have missed and will answer any questions about the product. Please note I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest feedback that had no impact in my review or ratings.",Ethical good tasting coffee

Normally I stray from reading a book that is a retell in a different POV. I mean I have not read Grey because of it being Fifty in the eyes of Christian

CM Doporto did a FANTASTIC job on this! She drew out the emotions and made me understand the how is and why is that are normally left when a book is only told from 1 POV.   If you think you were sucked into the Ravens Trap just from Lexis POV, just wait until you live it from The Raven himself!

156985,"Battle Assault 2, obviously, is a sequel to the first Gundam Battle Assault game, but ultimately falls short of what it could have been. The story mode is very GGundam/Gundam Wingcentric; I do not even think a game like this needs a story mode at all. It gets in the way of the point: robots beating the crap out of other robots. If they would eliminated the story mode and added about 20 more mobile suits, the game would have been much better as a straightforward fighter. As it stands, to unlock all of the available mobile suits you have to beat the game numerous times on numerous different difficulty settings, with numerous mobile suits. This proves supremely tiresome and timeconsuming, and in the end is not worth it.

As for the moves/gameplay, the game is awesome with two players and will provide hours of entertainment, and the special moves, music, and sound effects are welldone. For 1player mode, though? Yawn. My advice is to only purchase this game if you have someone to play it with, or if you are very bored and have a ton of free time to unlock everything.",Sequel to a great game

166921,If you love a quick hot shifter read then this one is for you. Alexa Riley writes really hot intsa love that includes a alpha and a spunky heroine. In Riding Red we meet Ruby the owner of Red's Goodie Basket who is new in town and is just starting her business. Little does she know she is living and working in a shifter town. The local sheriff Dominic wants Ruby so he is warned others to stay away from her. Dominic is a shifter and his wolf wants Ruby as thier mate but he has to wait until the mating moon on Halloween before he can declare his intentions to Ruby. Ruby is human and she will react differently to the mating pull. Ruby is attracted to Dominic but is aggravated with him scaring away her potential customers. Of course what is a Alexa Riley story without hot crazy bedroom antics and a over the top alpha. Hopefully this will be one of many into a new genre for Alexa.

200277,Absolutely love this!!! used it first time to drain the transmission oil in an International Flatbed. It works great and has alot of suction. When you get to the bottom of what your pulling oil from and you have it pumped up it actually keeps sucking air for a good 30 seconds when there is nothing left to suck out. We used it on our forklift to change the oil it literally got all of the oil out of the pan. We pulled the drain plug on the forklift to just see what it might have missed and only a few drops came out from the plug. We then tried it on the rearend of a big truck 4 gallons of different fluid and although you have to empty the container a few times it had no problem pulling up the thick different fluid.,Works great for European Cars as well as heavy equipment!

Right in the middle of this album are three songs not on either of their official 2CD anthologies; Chord Change, Another Night, and Spirit Of The Water which is on the Lunar Sea anthology but not Echoes.

Chord Change is reminiscent of the Allman Bros and is one of this band's better instrumentals and that is saying a lot. The fact that it was played at nearly all their live shows for 20 years after should tell you something.

The live 'extras' on this reissue are pretty good as well, but typical if you already have one of their live albums. All in all, a great album. Too bad I missed the boat for say, 30 years. Highly recommended.",Prog gem from the 70s

Yes, you can now hold 24 items in your clipboard and that is indeed something but is not that a nifty trick that could have been added as a download?  The task panes, etc. look nice but nobody in the work world is going to use them.  Also, you need a full screen when you are seriously working and some of Office Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry's innovations reduce the work area.
If you are happy with the Office suite you are currently using, keep it and ignore this upgrade.  There are no improvements big or small that justify the cost.  Yes, it has the best programs going but it is difficult to install and after you finally get it on your system you are left with  a clone of the Office Suite you were previously using.",But Where Is The Difference

If you do not want to worry about anything the iPhone 4 purchased running iso5 is the way to go. Great screen, great phone. It is solid and a beauty even though the screen seems small this late in the game. It comes with everything you would want and the iTunes store is great.

I like my HTC Sensation. Sense 3.0 and the 4.3"" screen are nice. Fast phone, nice build nothing special.

Just received my Nexus S and for this design being  one year old it is sweet!. Love the pure Android Ginger Bread. Yes it is plastic but the build is great and for me it is the best feeling phone in my hand.

Looking forward to having this phone for a long time. I will also keep my iPhone 4 but say good bye to the HTC.

185457,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

I have always preferred flops or slides.  I decided to try these slides and I have the matching flip flops about 2 years ago.  I wore these into the ground.  They were put into every situation, and I was rough on them.  I mowed the yard in them on my tractor, ran the weedeater, jumped in the pool with them on, raked leaves, tilled up the garden, remodeled a room in the house, etc.  If I was not at work, I had these on.  They are extremely comfortable, and the next best thing to being barefoot.

Well, a couple of weeks ago, one of my slides decided to give up the ghost as the fabric pulled away from the sole on one of them, and became too loose to keep on my foot.  It was a nobrainer for me to reorder some more Teva's.  It was a bonus that I was able to get the exact same ones!  I put these on, and I was back to having the same great slides on my feet.

The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!

165834,"This is one of the better TEOTWAWKI novels.  Earth is hit by an undefined event that wipes out the power grid and most electronic devices.  The protagonist is a young man on a school trip to Chicago, far from his actual home in northern Texas.  Law and order quickly deteriorates as starvation and chaos sets in, and he is on his journey to rejoin his family in Texas.

The plot sounds simple, and it is, but this particular ""SHTF"" story is more readable than most and more enjoyable than many.  I quite enjoyed this series, and this first installment in the series.  Do not read this one unless you plan to complete the four novel series, as each novel is more or less simply a portion of a single story.

5094,"I have owned two pet strollers previous to this purchase, and have learned the hard way that I should have held out for the better one right from the start. This is an excellent pet stroller. It does not feel rickety or cheesy like my other dog strollers. It turns on a dime and is super smooth on pavement, cobblestones and grass. It is also taller than I expected. I am 5'4"" and the handle reaches my ribcage, which makes it easy to hold on to. It took me a minute to get the ""one handed fold"" but I figured it out. It is not compact. This stroller takes up a big chunk of my passat wagon, but I do not mind at all. I wanted a durable stroller that would last, not another cheap one to throw away after the summer. I have two long haired chihuahuas. There was plenty of room and 360 viewing so they love it. I am not a jogger, but after an exhaustive search of available pet strollers, I chose this one for the smooth ride, the durable construction, and because I saw a video review on youtube that convinced me that it was a good investment. The only thing I would change is the color. There is only red. I would have liked something more understated like a nice green or light mango color. Aside from that, I highly recommend the pet gear jogger stroller.",Well constructed pet stroller with thoughtful features.

44793,"I originally posted a review where I gave this album 3 stars, but it has grown on me and I think it deserves 4 I only give a 5 to albums I consider classics. Stadium Arcadium does show how the band have matured so much over the years and now that I am 30 years old it is hard to believe the Chilli Peppers have been around since I was in junior high! Not many bands out there have that type of longevity, but the Peppers seem to get better with age. My favorites on this album are Charlie, Strip My Mind, Wet Sand, Tortue Me, Desecration Smile, She Looks to Me, and Animal Bar. Some have complained about filler and though some songs are better then others as with any album I do not think this CD has any throw away songs. My only complaint is that I wish there was a few more flat out rock songs instead of the midtempo songs that mostly dominate, but that is a mild complaint as from beggining to end this is a highly enjoyable album. Recent weeks have seen the release of album from Pearl Jam, Tool and now the Chilli Peppers so it is nice to see that rock is alive and well. Stadium Arcadium is one of those albums that will remain in my CD player for a long time to come.",On second thought....

The unusual brush shape takes some getting used to if, like me, you are used to a more conventional mascara wand.  After using this for a few days, though, I got the hang of it.  It is a bit tricky to use on your bottom lashes, but still coats those well.

While this is billed as a volumizing mascara, it also does add some length, without weighing down your lashes.  My current favorite mascara is Buxom Lash, and this is comparable in terms of giving a natural look to your eyes that is not too dramatic for daytime wear.

The formula also has not irritated my eyes, which water quite a bit because of allergies, and does not bleed when they have become teary.

Overall, I really like this!","The unusual brush takes some getting used to, but then it stays in place all day, even with allergy-prone eyes"

127464,"Give four stars because this is a great sturdy guitar stand that folds up nicely.  Not giving it five because it is better suited to hold an acoustic than an electric.  The short indentations for the thinner electric guitars is towards the front of the stand which means that an electric guitar leans ""back"" from vertical at a higher angle than an acoustic.  The angle of the acoustic is perfect, but the electric angle causes the headstock to go too far behind for my taste I play bass, so my necks are longer than a guitar neck.  Ideally, the indentations for the electric would be closer to the frame of the stand as opposed to being spaced farther away from the frame as is the case here, but i suspect that the one guitar design that is available with that configuration On Stage is patented because it is about twice the cost of this one.  Regardless, this stand is sturdy and universal, and it works well.  Cannot beat it for the price.",Give four stars because this is a great sturdy guitar stand that folds up nicely

Street 2 combines the craziest fake outs, dunks, and tricks with cool ghetto lingo You know that stuff that sounds good untill you say itand alot of classic appreciation. The controlls are slightly tricky if you have not played street1 but other than that the game is a complete head rush. Here Is the deal on the game modes. Of course you can choose an NBA team and play a game with all the fancy junk still in it. There is an NBA challenge where you take an NBA team and dismantle NBA divisions in a row to unlock courts. The best mode is definetly be a legend! You create a character and play games against the local play ground teams. For winning you can steal the other teams characters and get ability points so that you no longer stink. Eventually you face street legends like Dimes, Bonafide, Stretch, biggie little and you get a ghetto nickname.Ice water, Strings, CosmicYour team becomes good with the edition of the legends and you get to try out their signature moves. The goodies continue from there with NBA Legends like Bird, Wilt the still, Pistol Pete, Three versions of MJ, The lord of the Dunk DR. J Julius Erving it becomes insainly fun.
Give street a try and you will not be dissapointed. In fact you will probably be awstruck.

1851,"I bought this to hang on the side of a bowl to make my cat a water fountain since I did not like the look of the bulky white plastic pet fountains. This is exactly the size I was hoping for! I purchased some small ""pod"" shaped charcoal pet fountain filters from Walmart that I can drop in the filtering side of it. That said, I really only bought this to create the waterfall effect and have some moving water, so I cannot speak to how it works as an aquarium filter.

There is a line of the side to show where the water line should be up to. Because it is on the edge of a more shallow bowl, it is not as submerged on the ""water"" side as it would be if I were using a fish tank. If I fill the filter up with water before I plug it in, it is fine even if power is temporarily removed then restored if there were a power outage while I am not home, for example.

UPDATE: Since this moves my cats drinking water, it needs to be cleaned every couple days. I stopped using it because one of the tubes is curved and does not come apart. A grayish sludge has built up and I cannot reach to clean it. I ended up getting a regular unattractive, oh well pet bowl that comes apart and can be cleaned properly.","After a few weeks of use, just OK..."

13479,"I love the La RochePosay BB Blur Foundation I have been using for a year.  I decided to try this hydrating one to see if I could skip a step or two my moisturizing and age defying steps in my morning routine.  I like my current foundation by La RochePosay better than this one.  I wish companies would keep the same color names across foundations, It would be so much easier to try multiple formulas.  I tried the 2 lightest colorsLight Beige and Ivory.  I am very white, but the Ivory is ridiculously light.  When my husband saw me he said ""boo.""  I said ""what is that for?""  ""You look like a ghost,"" he replied.  The light beige was a better match to my skin tone, but still lighter than the other La RochePosay foundation.  This foundation is thicker than the BB Blur mouse.  It can be hard to apply, especially in the summertime.  I tried spreading it with my fingers and a foundation brush.  The brush spread better than my fingers, but left streaks, so I have to do a little of both to get the best coverage.  I took off 1 star for the coverage being hard to put on.  Powder helps set the foundation, so I only need to apply once a day.  It looks better with powder.  I was concerned the moisturizer might make me break out, but did not.  I decided not to skip my other morning routine steps.  I am not sure if this foundation helps, but it does not hinder moisturizing and age defying from my normal product routine. I am going to use the rest of this foundation, but stick with the BB Blur.  I Am going to save this for the cooler fall/winter.",Prefer La Roche-Posay's other foundation to this one

This is a true story about the Washington State College crew that won the Olympic Gold Medal in 1936 in Hitler's Germany.  Although one learns a bit about each remarkable  crew member, the story hinges largely on one,Joe Rantz, who had overcome extreme poverty and abandonment as a child to earn his way to college and the rowing crew.  One learns about all the skills needed in rowing, the building of the boats as well as the history of the time with the rise of Hitler, building of the Grand Coulee Dam, climate disasters such as the drought that forced farmers to give up their farms.  The research done for this book was extensive and completely documented in notes. And this book reads like a novel.  And I will be watching the rowing events in the next Olympics.",I loved this book

I only wear these socks when I run and figure each pair of socks has 2030 miles on them by now.  No issues with holes or wearing out yet.

To summarize, awesome socks but I feel like I am getting bent over on the price.","Love the socks, hate the price"
184404,"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years olTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it will not happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  Which sounds dirtier than it is  that is part of your shoulder.  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977   probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",Eats Lint

However, these are made with real fruit so there is an argument there for choosing these over the traditional pops. They are also organic, and have the Vitamin C added on for a bonus in nutrition. I must also add that they leave a wonderful aroma in the house when someone is enjoying one smile face",Pops Taste Like Real Fruit!!
185524,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

It seems he had some input also, which is great, because I feel it helped keep the story on track.  With such great actors as Jodie Foster, James Wood, John Hurt, and Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughey it is really hard to find a fault with the caste.  Tons of extras and commentary tracks, the only complaint I have is the same one I had when watching it in the movie theater.  And that is it is a tad too long.  Just a tad, maybe ten minutes more than it needed to be.
Outside of that it is a great movie and viewers of all ages should be able to enjoy it.  It really has a realistic feel to it and allows us to have a hint of what would happen if we did make First Contact.",Sciences sometimes needs faith?

I think it was because the story line made absolutely no sense. And Tom's grinning off and on all the time for no reason did not either. It appeared he seemed drunk all through the film.

34857,"This followup to the sublime Powerslave is rather weak. Part of the problem is the new sound they are using. The compositions themselves are obviously in the tradition of Iron Maiden but they come off sounding very flat compared to other Maiden discs. Sounds more like prog rock than straight heavy metal.
The best part of this disc is the superb lead guitar work by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. They really play with a lot of feel. The solos are fast in the tradition of good metal but also melodic.
The worst part of the disc is Bruce's vocals and some of the lyrics. Bruce is trying to sound operatic on some of the songs and he is just not up to the task. Sometimes he sounds like a howling old lady.
Some of the lyrics take a stab at being deep but come across as just silly  Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner being the main culprit. Alexander the Great was an attempt at doing another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The Rime, adapted from Samual Taylor Coleridge sp?, is a piece of epic metal genius. Alexander the Great sounds like Bruce is reading the lyrics out of a high school text book on European History. Simply foolish.
To sum up, the approach here is obviously similar to Powerslave but the results do not even compare. Somewhere in Time is one of Maiden's weakest.",Flat

68931,"In No God But One, Nabeel examines Islam and Christianity from a theological and historical perspective. Does the evidence support one worldview over the other?
Nabeel is a Christian, but he grew up in a Pakistani Muslim family in the US. He converted to Christianity after not being able to fully believe that ""There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger""the shahada there is more to that story detailed in ""Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus"". He does not think an objective observer would be convinced of the arguments for Islam, whereas the evidence for Christianity is supported by many sources.
I approached this book to learn more about Islam, since it is the second largest and fastest growing religion in the world. It puts into proper context some basal things: for example, the Quran and Bible are not theologically equivalent in each religion, what is the nature of Yahweh compared to Allah, how do the Crusades contrast with jihad there is more to read about the jihad in ""Answering JihaTongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry A Better Way Forward""?
I understand Islam more on account of this book, and I now feel that I can dialogue with Muslims about their faith and why they believe what they do. And remember, as Christians, we are called to ""in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect"" 1 Peter 3:15.",Well-Researched Treatise on Islam and Christianity

The only thing I wish Ms. Adams had given me was a prologue with church bells ringing.  Then the HEA would be forever, and I think it would have been better for the girls.

Bottom Line: I was blown away by this program, totally impressed!!

Why?

1 It is easy to use out of the box many of the controls are easy enough to figure out just by using them, it installs easy on both Mac and PC systems I installed the program on both an old eMac and a low end Vista laptop successfully.

2 It is really powerful once you really get into the software, it is amazing all the different brushes and textures and effects that you can do to make really impressive art.

3 The tutorials are first rate A thick instruction manual that actually is well written, and actually teaches you about basic principles of art and painting.  There are also a whole series of video tutorials included free.  You can tell that a lot of hard work and frankly a lot of love went into this, which is a rarity for computer software these days.

4 It is a great value For all you get, the price is very reasonable.  And check the company's website, if you are still not sold they were at the time of this writing offering a 60 day free downloadable trial.

One more tip:  Get even a lowprice graphics tablet to go along with the software you will be glad you did!",Amazing Power for the Price!

Previously had about 2 drops of dish soap from when I installed window tint. This stuff is substantially more sticky than window tint, hence the additional soap.

This tool does not get moved a lot, but after maybe the 4th time used, the plastic cams broke.
I called HTC customer service and they are sending me replacement cams in an upgraded metal version.
They offered to do this at no charge, even though the warranty is out at 15 months.

The text listing the features say ""limited lifetime warranty"" but if you download the warranty paper it has only a ONE YEAR warranty.
But they are honoring the warranty anyway.  That is a good sign.

41700,"M Ward's Transistor Radio is an eclectic mix of genres that is captivating in its beauty and scope. If I needed one word to describe the album it would be ethereal.  With influences both classical and popular this album hearkens back through the years giving it an ultimately timeless feel.  I highly recommend this one.

Transistor Radio opens up with ""You Still believe in me"" which showcases Wards musical ability with this purely American tune that is reminiscent of Bluegrass and Folk.  And of course worthy of note is his cover of Louis Armstrong's ""Sweethearts on Parade"". I am always fearful when an artist sets out to cover Armstrong.  It usually sounds more like a mockery than serious art.  But Ward is so focused and creative that he can pull it off making the work something entirely new while still keeping the feel of the Armstrong original.  Lastly, I must mention ""Fuel for Fire""  which is exemplary of wards haunting vocals and ""Four Hours in Washington"" with its shuffling rhythm sound like a Tom Waits song.

M Ward is a true artist and this is a great work.  If I had to compare him to anyone it would be to Tom Waits.  They both have a real knack for mixing genres and adding subtle hints and allusions to other styles and songs. They are both true American Artists. Transistor Radio has wide appeal and I think fans of ""emo"" to fans Billie Holiday will find this a great album. M Ward is one to watch and this is a super album.  Buy a copy today.

I have been daily carrying mine, atleast 5 days a week to work, for 2 years. I have changed the batteries twice, so I am a not a heavy user, but it I have punished it a few times. My two year old got a hold of it and gave it a pretty good beating. After a little cleaning and love, back in action it went, and it is lighting things up as strong as ever.

Waterproof, I am sure not. Can you beat this light into darkness, yes. It is not a super ruggedized indestructo light. What is though, is durable enough to carry on you and use frequently, for years. For the price it is beyond worth it.

However, it is still a lot of fun. The finished 3D project is very delicate, the lines can only be as thick as the provided tips, none of them are super thick so be ready to keep your 3d item somewhere safe, it will be fragile.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

As others here have noted, Rameau on the piano is a different experience from Rameau on the harpsichord, but for me it is a wonderful experience when the piano is this well played.

As with her magnificent Bach recordings, Hewitt brings a flawless technique, deep scholarship and an obvious love of the music to this disc.  She judges tempi and ornamentation perfectly to my ears, giving the music exactly the right feel and she uses the expressive capabilities of the piano to bring out the music's qualities without ever imposing flashy tricks or inappropriate sentiment on it.  It is a joy from start to finish and I never tire of listening to it.

I love my wonderful set of Rameau on the harpsichord by Christophe Rousset and this certainly does not replace it, but it complements it beautifully.  The recorded sound is as always from Hyperion excellent and the notes and presentation are very good and I recommend this very warmly  it is a beauty.",A real beauty
47425,"The music here is easily worth 5 stars.  But this outdated and extremely incomplete collection is not.

Sure, in 1976, this was not a bad idea.  But in 2010, you would be much better off buying the 2CD set ""Very Best of the Eagles.""  It spans their entire original period, 19711980, and includes all the big hits.  This album seems like a budget release in this day and age simply because more definitive collections have been released since.

The Eagles are one of my top favorite groups but to buy this album would be to ignore the brilliant second half of their career  the half that gave us the masterpieces ""Hotel California"" and ""The Long Run.""  The 2CD set from 2003 covers it all, and that is what true Eagles fans ought to have.","Not Bad, But You Can Do Better"

The casters are total lock: when you apply the lever brake, it locks both the wheel turning and rotating. The locking lever is easily applied and released.

The blue polyurethane wheels are a bit harder than the red tread. They therefore do not roll as silently and easily as the softer red urethane tires.",Nice Little Total Lock Casters

14034,"I absolutely love when my wife's skin is soft and silky.  Lately though, she has been using products that do not last long and with the dry air, her skin gets rough and flaky.  When given the opportunity to try the Juice Beauty Nutrient Moisturizer, I thought, what the hay, it cannot make things much worse.  So, the day we received the product, she tried it and what a difference.  Her skin radiated with softness for a real long time.  She said that with as dry as her skin was, it sucked right in but the next application stayed for a while.  She also said that a little of this product can go a long way which is good because it is not cheap.  Anyway, I know that some of the reviews said that it made a heavy feel but my wife has not complained of that yet and I am okay with it.  I will be getting this product again as long as she is willing to use it.",Great moisturizer

Very slim design.
high quality plastic that does not get dirty.

Cons:
Very slippery if your hands are even remotely dirty or sweaty.
Even with it being as slim as it is, the iPhone still does not fit into a OEM iPhone dock.

97098,"This review is for essie Gel Couture Nail Polish set with the 144inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat.  ""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and does not require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, nonstreak opaque color with one application  second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard she will which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 35 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you would get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend.","Long lasting, great color"

The lead character, JJ, must overcome demons of the past.  The other significant characters Claire, Cora, Darrel, Ian, Brenda and Avery, plus a few more are intriguing too and I wondered about their lives as well.  I recommend The Miracle Girl.

They can hold a little bit of cotton on that one part of your heel that your shoes rub, they can cover up tattoos if you have weird family members that hate tattoos... they can even keep a little dot of Neosporin on a cut or scrape!

These fabric BandAids are probably the best bandage, not only because they are a really nice flexible fabric, but also because they do not leave that sticky fuzzblackened adhesive behind on your skin like some of the cheaper, generic options. I also really like that they are available on AmazonFresh, and are priced comparably to your local CVS/Walgreen's/Target/Grocery Store... you do not even need to leave home to get some of these awesome bandages!

Michelle has always done such a wonderful job of capturing these characters emotions that you cannot help but to feel what they are feeling. Sadie and Brady are planning their guys one that I Have been waiting for, but what we get to see is them trying to still battle the ghosts of their past. Sadie with the death of her brother and the fact that hes not there and then Brady gets a blast from the past, one that has left him scarred. The thing I love watching was seeing that both Brady and Sadie had to realize that there are things that they are still learning and will continue to learn from each other. Then we have the fact that the gang always has each other backs, they are there for each other through thick and thin, and boy did they need each other. I am very saddened to say goodbye to Brady, Sadie, Grant, Jessa, Dex, Chrissy, Rob and Paige.",Perfect ending to a wonderful series

211550,"This product works OK and is especially friendly to novices, but there is two things about it that make me wonder if Symantec has a monkey for a product manager on this product.

1 Users cannot migrate settings for firewall, trusted zones etc. from one version to another. So for each upgrade you pay for, you get to spend a couple hours rekeying in all your special rules for your firewall so your P2P,  game software, tunneling etc. keeps working.  and of course, a year's worth of ""let that program talk to the Web"" responses are also lost.

2 You buy the product, but at the end of the yearly update subscription, you do not just lose the ability to update. The morons at Symantec have programmed it to TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALL COMPLETELY! Boom  you are left unprotected by the software you PAID for just because you have not PAID AGAIN by a certain date for the new virus subscription. So if you happen to be traveling,  your computer could be left w/o even basic firewall protection until you get back and notice. This is TOTALLY unacceptable!

So my recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere until Symantec wises  up. Unless these two issues are properly addressed, it really does not matter how good the other functions are. The product is not worth the effort to reprogram the firewall each year and the risk of being left without even basic firewall protection just because the update subscription runs out makes it a nonstarter.  I would give it zero stars if I could.",Norton is clueless about user requirements

But, then I realized they are perfect for holding my grandfather's wedding ring onto my thumb. So, any time I get an option to receive a discount in exchange for an honest review, as I did this one, I take it.  I want as many colors as possible.  This one is enough smaller that it does not hold on the ring as well.  It works, more or less, but it sometimes slides over it.

It is one of the few things left to do that bring some joy from home and give us a chance to escape reality and just have fun.

This is the second game now I have found that REQUIRE a constant highspeed internet connection, just to play single player.  The first I saw was Assassin's Creed II and now this one, another highanticipated game.  What in the world are these companies thinking?  They do not even have servers that can handle the loads of people trying to sign on to the SINGLE PLAYER games, so you may find yourself waiting hours upon hours just to sign in.  Then you will find yourself knocked off when the server slows down too much.  [...] for this?

As far as the military community hundreds of thousands of people are concerned  NONE of us can every play these games while deployed, TDY or just traveling around the country.

I can understand companies doing what they can to prevent copyright infringement, but this is TOO FAR.  You have alienated an entire corps of people and the hatred for this type of program requirement is growing drastically among the public.

45600,"Although this is only one of a few of Pete Townshend's solo works, I personally feel that Pete was a much better songwriter with the Who than without.  As a solo artist, there are only a few songs on this CD, ""Empty Glass"" that caught my attention; namely ""Rough Boys"", ""Let My Love Open The Door"", and ""Going To Get Ya"".  While Pete can still rock on this CD, he does not show the bravado as he did on the early Who works, like ""Live at Leeds"", ""Tommy"", ""Who is Next"", and ""Quadrophrenia"".  In my mind, THAT was The Who I want to remember; that had consistently good songs throughout the album that qualified them as megarockstars.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

117133,"Of all the actors to portray Satan, Al Pacino gives the best performance as the prince of darkness over everyone else.  It is Pacino's performance as John Milton aka: Satan that makes The Devil's Advocate worthwhile; with every other actor to portray Satan, they always portray him as a menacing, relentless sum of all evil.  Pacino gives Satan a classy swagger never before seen, making the devil seem more human than previously imagined.  The film itself is great, with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Kevin Lomax, a hotshot lawyer who gets his chance to work in Pacino's lawfirm.  The beautiful Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen give good performances as well, especially Theron as Reeves' wife who senses something foul afoot, and eventually starts to lose her mind.  Jeffrey Jones and Craig T. Nelson give good performances as well, Nelson is rather good as a murder suspect who Reeves is picked to defend.  All in all, The Devil's Advocate is a great thriller, and Pacino is devilishly no pun intended charming as Satan.  A little side note: when Pacino and Reeves go to the boxing match, Pacino introduces Reeves to Don King and they seem to be good friends.  Whoever said that Don King made deals with the devil might have been right afterall.",Al Pacino gives the devil his due

For what it is worth,  I ADORE Pamela's crunchy Ginger Snapsnbsp;nbsp; my favorite of all the ones I have tasted, even nonGF  we all have to remember that food ratings are a taste bud thing.

17662,"This is a good product. I am new to French skincare but I do not think I am ever going back lol. It was recommended by my dermatologist, he recommended effaclar duo specifically. But I saw this in the trio and figured it was a good deal. If you can use it over a weekend when you will NOT go out in the sun, that is a good bet. Certain products in it make your skin sensitive to the sun, it says that on the packaging. The first time I used it was at night so I did not notice it, the next morning when I used it and headed to work, my skin was on FIRE. I have sensitive skin and I am African American so it really REALLY hurt. I did not get a sun burn thankfully.  The gel cleanser has sort of a minty tingly feeling, the clarifying solution just makes your skin feel clean and soft. I use the duo as a spot treatment if I have a pimple. One day I had a blackhead on my forehead near my eye, I put the duo on it and when I woke up in the morning the pimple was gone. I mean COMPLETELY gone. Again be careful with this product, use it every other day until your skin gets used to it. And do not forget the sunscreen.",Good product but be careful in the sun

81050,"I purchased this phone through Tracfone. I was in a pinch because my old one broke and I did not have time to research this phone very much. They allow you to preview the phone for a month and still return it. However I did not begin to notice until it was after this 30 day period. That the lock button still allowed functions to run such as web browsing and it would not unlock every time. I had to take the battery out to reboot. Anyway I bought a different phone Samsungt404g which I expect to be much better. I lost the price I paid for the Lg500g which I am not to happy about but I am willing to cut my losses this time.

Good luck,

41850,"I had this album back in 1975, and fell in love with it.  This is without a doubt their best.  I picked up the remastered CD AM 2002, and it sounds much better than this LP.  Which is surprising given that most albums deserving of 180G remastering that I have heard get a proper treatment and sound wonderful.  The highs are lacking, the overall level is at least 6 db lower than most of my albums, and it sounds thin.  It is absolutely full of pops and clicks brand new out of the sleeve.  I was so looking forward to getting this, and now I am so disappointed.  Why bother?

Furthermore, in doing a little more research it seems that most of the Back To Black vinyl series were poorly done.  From what I gather they are taking CDs and essentially pressing vinyl from them which totally defeats the purpose.  They are going to be just as thin and lacking as a CD with the added bonus of pops and clicks.  Yippee.  Capitol Valuts is another one to stay away from.","The music is great, the mastering is very bad"

117982,"Did you ever think that Spinal Tap was a real group? Then you were probably appalled at their appearances on the late shows! But if you were like me you became an instant fan once you knew the secret.
So, is the Criterion DVD good?  Yes!  But do not go searching for the Break Like The Wind stuff because it are not there. Several of the best videos were included on the 1992 VHS release.  But they are missed in this DVD form.  What IS included is great!  A lot of outtakessome funny, some not. Although several bits I feel could have stayed in, you will agree that they used the best stuff for the final film. It is interesting to note that most drug references and all the nudity was clipped from the film. Also, the actress from the movie ""Just One Of The Guys"" was clipped.  The new lead guitar player was a very interesting idea.  Perhaps that should have stayed in.  Other material: commercials, promotional materials, complete videos, interviews such as the Flower People press conference, and more. Plan to spend almost 3 and a half hours on this DVD. It is great fun! The DVD interface is one of my favorites; with new stuff recorded just for the DVD presentation.
So put this in your machine, crank it up the sound quality is pretty good and put Spinal Tap on BEFORE the puppet show!",Tear inducingly funny at times.

As in life, things never go to plan. While in Italy she meets the gorgeous Jacques Sinclair, a very sexy photographer.

219295,This cover scares me so far. I just purchased it a couple weeks ago and put it on my pool today. The cover I had previously for my pool was a heavy tarp style cover. I received this one In the mail the other day and it basically feels like a heavy trash bag. Granted it feels like a hefty trash bag and not a  store brand trash bag but still with the new England winters we have I hope it can stand up to the weather. If it did not come with an 8 year limited warranty I would have returned it for sure after I opened it. I will certainly give it a try this winter and see how it works. hopefully everything will turn out ok. The price was most certainly right compared to other covers I looked at.

I have played Martin strings on my Martins all my life. But recently I read some reviews of these D'Addarios that made me try them.
I am impressed, like really impressed. Blown away impressed.
I was in the studio and just not getting the clean sparking sound I wanted for a really fast acoustic guitar song. I replaced my main string, Martin 80/20s,  with these and the guitar just sang.
We had to cut the highs a little because it was so sparkly. We did not cut the lows, though, who would even think about that... and when we listened to the takes, the bass notes were so boomy we could not even cut it enough with 4 different EQs.
We had to rerecord the takes after meticulously resetting the mics EQ on the preamp and board. That is amazing. This never happened before. These F'n strings SING! They blew me and everyone away. WTF? I got a case of Martins I do not want to use now.",Martin Fan Is Impressed

209020,"First, let me say that I love TurboTax.  I have been using it for years to do my taxes and it has made it relatively painless.  Up until now, if you purchase the Deluxe version you get free Federal efile, because the IRS does not charge for this service.  Remember when they did?  TurboTax used to charge a fee.  But, now they do not because the IRS does not.

So, the State of California sent out notices this year saying that they have free efiling.  I assumed that when I did an automatic upload of any changes to the taxes this year that TurboTax would also upload the fact that the State of California has free efiling.  However, they still charge an extra $20 for efiling the State return.  I looked at their community question and answer sections
, and it appears that many states now offer free efiling, and other tax payers also assumeD that meant TurboTax would file their state return for free.  However, TurboTax just takes the $20 out of your tax refund.

So, if they do not change things next year, without increasing the price on their software, I will no longer be purchasing TurboTax.  If I have to fill out the same information a second time on the State of California tax website, why do I need TurboTax?

22916,"I am learning to do metal stamping and wire work and I decided copper would be the metal I worked with.  Easier to choose one so I can keep one set of chain and findings around.  I bought these to practice stamping.  The finish is lovely actually better than some larger RMP copper square blanks I also bought and is protected by plastic films on each side.  It matches my other bright copper materials headpins, eyepins, jump rings, etc. so finished pieces incorporating these have a professionallymade appearance.  The films are a bit difficult to remove but you should remove them before stamping.

This is a good width for lettering, although I am primarily using symbols instead of letters just personal preference.  So far I have done pretty well in my practice attempts at stamping with a steel bench block, one pound hammer, and ImpressArt stamps there were a few other branded stamps in there I tried, as well.  I am able to punch through it with a EuroTool metal punch so I can put holes in the ends.

Whether or not you need to smooth out the edges depends on how you use these.  There are a number of affordable rotary tools on Amazon if you decide to smooth out the edges.  I have one from Black and Decker.  You may want to run over the surface with a polishing cloth, but the surfaces were pretty good to begin with better than some of the other copper stamping blanks I bought.

Alistair and Black BettyI loved these two together, no matter who was on top! I could feel the internal conflicts going on for both of them, particularly Black Betty.  So many sides to her are revealed  strength, vulnerability, dom and sub  and each one is such an important part of who she is or can be.  And Alistair, hes super cocky and damn hot because of it! Then throw in his desire to care for and be with Black Bettysigh.

This may be a novella but there is so much to love about it. I can only hope that Alistair and Black Bettys story continues!

44906,"Obviously, Carrie listened to all of the Nashville critics, and actually made a straightforward Country album.  As many of you are well aware, Nashville did not throughly embrace Carrie as a Country artist, since her debut album was more of a Pop Album with Country undertones.  However, she made a bold move, and dropped the Pop sound entirely, and went ahead and made a Country CD..... and it does not work, for a number of reasons.

This album sounds forced from beginning to end.  There is none of that free flowing, goosebump giving kind of music that the first album offered.  I listened to this entire CD 3 different times, and realized, there is really not a good song on the entire CD.  ""Last Name"" would have to be the best song, if there is one.  ""All American Girl"" sounds forced, and I am not buying it.

This was an enormous letdown, and I am completely baffled by the many positive reviews this album received on here.  It is simply NOT a good CD, at all.  Carrie's still adorably beautiful though. Happy face or smiley",Straight Country Isn't Working For Me

2 The stepbystep instructions on filing K1 forms are muddled to the point of being impossible for me to use  even after repeated attempts.  Twice TurboTax asked for information that went beyond that provided on my K1 form itself, and which I had no idea how to answer.  One prompt suggested something like ""enter negative one in column A"".  I had no idea to what the prompt was referring.
3 TurboTax reported one discrepancy in values between those on my Federal and State returns although the values on my State return were loaded by TubroTax itself from my Federal return that TurboTax had just prepared.

Tippermere has love in the air. Charlotte Lottie Brinkley is in line to inherit the Tipping House Estate where she lives with Rory Steel.
Lottie really wants a quiet Christmas with just Rory and her and has hope that perhaps this Christmas might be special with Rory giving her an engagement ring even though he already proposed. She has a special Santa costume already set to woo Rory.
But the things at the Tipping House Estate are never as simple as that. Lady Elizabeth Stanthorpe is the current owner of the Tipping House Estate and is Lotties grandmother. She really wants to help Rory surprise Lottie.
There are missing turkeys, loose horses and troublesome terriers all to make for some wonderful excitement. The ever so quiet Christmas that Lottie is hoping for never stands a chance. One invite leads to another and to another. A meal for 2 turns into a meal for 10 with lots of excitement and surprises.
Lottie prepared some of the Christmas meal at the main house on the estate but the meal itself was going to be at Rory and her place. Lottie was reminded to be sure to steam the pudding.
Lottie is disappointed that her ring was not under the Christmas tree. She was going to try to not let the romantic dream that did not happen spoil the day.
Rory thought of a horse for Lottie and it has a special surprise in his bridle. Lottie got her special Christmas gift!!!",Lottie got her special Christmas gift!!!

76414,"I have purchased two of these, one to replace my jawbone and one for my network technician.  I have not soaked it in beer, buried it in sand, nor gone swimming with it.

Sound quality is OK ambient noise will overwhelm it.  Wind noise makes it cut out in 12 second instances making it unusable outside when there is a breeze.

Fit is a compromise between durability and comfort.  It works, the neck strap is very handy.  It appears durable enough to stuff in my pocket when not in use and the ear clip is free swiveling so I am not worried about breaking it and having a stash of spares.

Update I dropped it in the parking lot, someone ran over it.  Apparently military durability does not include the ability to withstand crushing forces.

I am not sure I will buy another.  The device had decent sound quailty except when a slight breeze would cause it to cut out.  Other headsets transmit a static sound, this model just cuts off when the wind sound occurs.  I am back to searching for a decent noise canceling headset again.",so far ok-don't run over it with your car though

108410,"Holly Sissy Spacek, a 15yearold girl living in a North Dakota town, falls under the influence of twentysomething social misfit Kit Martin Sheen.  When her father Warren Oates stands in their way, Kit kills him and hits the road with Holly, who thinks she is in love with him.  They hide out in the wilderness for awhile, and then go on the run, killing several people along the way.

Director/screenwriter Terence Malick has given us characters that are emotionally barren, as reflected by the barren landscapes of North Dakota.  They occasionally seem happy together, but most of the time they seem emotionally flat and detached from their own feelings; Holly seems as if she is in a constant state of shock.  Malick's style is almost like that of a documentary, presenting the events and trusting us to draw our own conclusions.  Sheen and Spacek, both at the beginnings of their careers, show a great deal of talent./","Cold, stark portrayal of young killers"

183921,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

64805,"This is a story about abandonment, about being caught between two worlds, and about making your way in the world.

Violet Minturn grew up in a courtesan house in Shanghai in the early 20th century, the daughter of the American madam. She observed how her mother, Lulu, engaged her clients, the wealthiest Chinese and American men in the city, in conversation about their businesses and their power. As far as she can tell, her mother loves her business more than she loves Violet.

When her mother abandons her, she makes her living the only way she knows howas a courtesan. For a time, she falls in love and leaves that life behind, but her joy is shortlived when her lover dies, and his legal wife claims Violet's children as her own.

Tan weaves a vivid, epic tale about Violet's life, and toward the end she reveals what really happened to Lulu.

My greatest concern is that young women will read this book and perceive Lulu and Violet's lives as a courtesan romantic. The story details the inner workings of highclass prostitution, and makes it seem glamorous. I do not think that is Tan's intention; between the lines I see conviction that the sex industry is exploitation. Nevertheless, there it is. The writing is fabulous. I recommend the book with that one caveat. It is the reason why I cannot give it 5 stars.",The workings of a high-class courtesan house.

201140,"I just installed these shocks on the rear of my Silverado.  They have really tightened the ride and do a great job of smoothing out bumps.  They come with a green plastic strap holding them compressed in the box.  These things are a beast to recompress, so you probably will not be doing it one handed.  What I found to work well was to place the shock in the lower bracket and run the bolt through.  I then tightened the nut by hand to keep the bolt in place.  Getting ready to slip the bolt through the upper bracket, I slid the green strap off the top of the shock and controlled its angle and speed of decompression with my one hand.  As the shock slid up to the upper mount I quickly slid the bolt through the shock and bracket with my free hand.  This worked great on both sides, I did need to tap the bolt a bit with a rubber mallet on the one side to finish pushing it through though.  Finally, tighten the nuts, cut the packaging strap and you are good to go.",Work great on Silverado 1500

185523,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

44327,"As a guy that listens to rock and hip hop, I never was a N sync fan. That is until I had to do security at their  Oakland,CA ""Popoddesy"" tour for two days. I was surprised at the stage, 100 foot screen TV, fireworks, conveyor belts, The works to make a successful show. After I worked the show, I went and purchased the CD.On thier third effort, J.C and Justin managed to pull off some of the dirtiest pop I have ever ran across. Thier CD is well built on up tempo dance music. And they have also did some production themselves.
Songs like ""the game is over"" is pretty darn good for a boy band. But you have funk driven beats like ""girlfriend"" and ""Celebrity"" that put this CD into mainstream rotation big time. I predict this CD to go Diamond 10 million. As far as the boy band reputation goes, they have earned my respect and I look at them totally different now.","Surprisingly Good, for a BOY BAND"

13540,"It is funny, so many cheaper brands of facial lotion fail because they try to do so much. They try to be the deepest moisturizer ever, or get rid of wrinkles, or for some unknown reason think it is a good idea to heavily perfume their lotion so we will feel luxurious or something.

What I love about this straightforward and simple face cream is that it does exactly what it says and nothing more. It moisturizes my combination skin perfectly, not too heavy, not too light, and the sun protective factor works great. I cannot smell it at all, which is perfect.

On most days, I spent about 1 to 2 hours out in the sunshine gardening. If I forget to use sunscreen, I definitely feel some soreness on my face and neck. So having sunscreen included in my normal daily facial moisturizer is great.

I was also really impressed that the pump dispenser dispenses an accurate amount to cover my face. When I first used it, I snickered at how little it gave me and I pumped out three globs of it and started covering my face. I quickly realized that this facial lotion goes farther than most brands do, so one pump was actually perfect for my face, and I will use a second pump for my ears, neck, and back of my neck. Given how little you need to use for effective coverage, this actually seems like a pretty good deal as well as being an effective product.",Unobtrusive facial moisturizer with effective sunscreen

I subscribed to ""Bon Appetit"" as well and these two go hand in hand.

19431,"The compact on this powder has a pretty design, a goodsized mirror you can see your whole face, and a soft sponge for application.

This powder itself has a light, smooth, airy feel. Actually, a velvety feel, so it is aptly named. It is purpose is to set makeup and give skin a matte finish, and it delivers those results as promised. The ""mattifying"" lasts for several hours, probably longer if your skin is very dry.

The shade is sort of an eggshe will white, which the manufacturers say is universal. This is true, to some extent, but I would caution those who use it to APPLY WITH A LIGHT HAND. I mention this because if you apply it heavily, you get a ""lightening"" effect. In other words, you will see white on your face. This is not to say the product has any glitter or pearl. It does not. Still, use too much, and you will notice that white look.

PG Tips even works well in my Keurig brewer using a Melitta Java Jig filter but NOT using any of several other filter rigs I have tried.  Your mileage may vary, but try it!  Flatten the bag out as evenly as you can in the bottom of the filter, but do not tear the bag.  Drop the bag into the mug for a few moments after running the brewer if you want your tea stronger.  These bags are a little harder to accidentally tear than most, so there is less chance of ending up with leaves in your tea.  These bags also seem to be geared a little more toward making a potful than a mugful, so do not let your tea steep for more than a minute or two unless you like it really strong!",My Favorite Decaf Black Tea

207331,"I have used TTax for a number of years.  As of yet, I have not had any problems or have been audited.  I am a simple, retired, taxpayer with uncomplicated taxes.  What I want is easy and cheap.  I have not been a fan of ""online"" taxes in that they may not be available when I need them.  And, then, there is the possibility of someone hacking your personal data.  TTax continues to make doing my simple taxes easy and quick.  I am not just looking for a maximum refund, I am looking at not going to jail!  What I do not like is that they continue to try and extract more money from you by offering more services.  But, they are a ""business"" and maybe you should expect this or expect to pay more for their s/w, or, maybe it might be a good service for you.  Every year, I look at other tax programs and they just do not seem to measure up for about the same price.  TTax at least inputs my basic previous data like name and SSn.

The cover for the shorter bed did not  settle down as quick over cast day and left a gap over the tail gate.  I just snugged the cover down and allowed it more time for the gaskets and vinyl to settle in.  Seemed well built, solid construction to me and went on easily.  Comes off just as quick.  Heed the warning about the position of the rear lock down arms, I can see where if you do not move the arms into the same position when you fold it up as they were when you unpacked this cover, they will damage your vinyl cover.

89563,"I just love trying new products, especially when I am given the opportunity to try them at a deeply discounted price in exchange for my feedback! We get to try more products this way, and I save money as well.

I purchased this Muscles Roller Massage Stick by Giwox because I have been having sore muscles mostly lower back but also tightness across the shoulders from working in the garden and I wanted something that my son could learn to use to help work out the kinks. The bright colors appealed to me, and the length of this stick is just right to cover my back and shoulders without being overwhelming. The stick is not terribly heavy, so even a kid can use it sort of like a rolling pin, and the beads are textured so they have more of an effect when rolled across tight muscles. 0

Pros:
easy to use
durable
nice size and weight
rolls smoothly

Cons:
None

Overall, I am quite happy with this purchase and would recommend.

Citrix vitamin D procollagen brightening serum  is a waterbased serum in my research found that this is intended or alright to use under a moisturizer. I have been using it at night after removing make up and cleansing my face. The directions state to massage a thin layer once or twice daily or as directed by your physician.

This product contains the following ingredients which Citrix claims have beneficial properties: TETREHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, L ASCORBIC acid, ARBUTIN, bearberry, EMBLICA, and vitamins A, and E, and CoQ10.  The claims are to improve skin texture and tone resulting in a healthier looking skin and to brighten the skin. My experience is that if my skin is dry this adds moisture. Its soaks in immediately. I have to use about six drops to cover my face. This is not greasy or sticky.

143074,"After replacing both the batteries and probe element on my Milwaukee Martini ph56 to no avail still does not work, and I Am out another $50, I ordered this for checking the pH of my brewing water. Note that this meter is roughly half the price of the probe alone on the ph56 if you get a good price on that part. I find it easy to use and calibrate. I actually like the mechanical, setscrew calibration because its very quick. This meter also seems to settle down very quickly. I use twopoint calibration with 7.0 and 4.0 solutions not the reference packs provided, which use slightly different reference values and requiring mixing because I have them available in bottles; after spending half a minute doing that, this meter seems accurate. I am going to buy another to keep on hand, since pH meters have a limited life expectancy. I like the idea of just replacing the whole thing when needed. Note that there is a similar model that has twodecimal accuracy 0.01 for a few dollars more. You must rinse the tip before and after using this or any other pH meter, as the manual recommends for proper maintenance. The manual instructs users to simply put the cap on tightly after the final rinse, but since I only brew every 46 weeks, I Am concerned the probe will dry out, so Ill probably store it with a piece of buffersoaked sponge in the cap to keep the probe tip wet. I wonder if other users of this meter have any experience with this.",Excellent value and easy to use and calibrate

12700,"I am a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps  a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" cross between hard cream  soap rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush  the ""Marco method"" if you are new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it  you will not regret it, and provides a good, close, irritationfree shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat I shave in the shower  store my soap there, so there is a lot of water and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses  fresh cut grass. It is very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red  white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso disappointing, since I loved the scent, but neither the green or the white because any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",Not just for men!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is my second pair of Timberland work boots.  My first pair were the Pitboss and they were great boots.  Lasted 1.5 years before one of the soles split.  This time around I wanted something a little lighter weight so I splurged a few extra bucks and picked up the Titan series.  These are much more comfortable from the start.  No stiffness or tight spots anywhere.  I wore them 10 hours straight the first day and felt just as good as when I put them on.  I hope they at least last as long as my last pair of Timberland boots.  I wear a 10M and they fit perfect.

113151,"This early Woody Allen comedy is often quite a bit of fun.  Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I do not want to overstate the criticism, as ""Take the Money and Run"" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It is just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I am not as big a fan of it as some other folks.

Unfortunately, the fullframe version of ""Take the Money and Run"" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the fullframe image.  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.

But, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we have come to expect that from Mr. Allen, have not we?  To his credit, the man does not like to go on and on about his movies, preferring to let them speak for themselves.","He had better days ahead, but this is what put Woody on the map"

158883,"The wacky humor BrocoLee, varied level designs underwater, pastry factory, space station, etc., a cardboard cut out look and odd concept Come on, what other game has you saving the world by eating evil vegetables while collecting magical poo? of The Munchables add up to one of the most fun gaming experiences I have had in some time.

This is classic 3D platforming done in a way to appeal to gamers as young as 5 or as old as time.  Yes the control is simple and more experienced gamers will not be exceptionally challenged by the gameplay but few other games will get you laughing or feeling as good as The Munchables does.  The biggest challenge comes from figuring out how to beat some of the bosses which can take some trial and error.

In the main game you earn bonus items to decorate your character with 3D glasses, pirate hats, etc. by collecting acorns.  Once the game is beaten, you earn a radar upgrade that points out acorns you missed on your first go round.  This is a feature more platform games should incorporate.  Another feature that opens once the main story has been completed is Mirror Mode which has you go through each level in reverse under a time constraint which is actually pretty tough to complete in later levels.

Bottom line, do not dismiss The Munchables.  It may look easy and childish perhaps it even is, but by not playing The Munchables you miss out on a uniquely fun experience that you will remember long after the controller is put down.",More Fun Than You Think

120829,"If you play a classical guitar or an acoustic with nylon strings, you play because you love the tone and the fact that the nylon is easier on the finger tips.  Once in a while, more volume is needed.  That means using a microphone or a pickup.  There are pickups everywhere, but not so many that will work well with nylon strings.  The Docooler is one that will.  Pickups are often tricky to install.  For some, you even have to restring the guitar or even drill a hole in your guitar.  Not with the Docooler pickup.  It can be inserted and removed with ease in moment without marring the finish on your guitar.  This pickup was actually shipped to me FROM CHINA.  I thought I would have to wait for the proverbial ""SLOW BOAT"", but delivery was made in about 6 days.  Money well spent.

If you are a guitarist with a Hard Rock or Metal band, this is not what you are looking for.  If you play real classical guitar or acoustic and need an occasional volume boost, this is for you.","For the money, a great buy"

202749,"Overall I am impressed. My rig is a 25 Ft Attitude toy hauler. I bought it used and it had a mixed set of scissor jacks. One side took a hexagon type socket handle and the other used a different kind of handle that is very different. Also the amount of torque it took to crank each jack varied. It was unpleasant so I replaced all of them with this kit. The old jacks were secured on using much too small self tapping screws. These screw up and down smoothly, they are solidly built and the handle has a hinged socket that makes cranking more comfortable. The part that I did not like about these is the mounting screws that come with it. They are beefy lag bolts but are not self tapping so you have to drill your own holes and thread them in yourself. It is a bit of a challenge. I used a step drill and then threaded them in using a large ratchet and socket. They are secured solid and work great.",Nice Product

185658,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

25870,"This bag arrives flat and is made so it pops up to form a storage bag; voila! The bag seems sturdy and will not cave in. It looks like denim on the outside and the inside is blue and white polka dots. It is very well made and the stitching all looks good. You can carry it by the attached handle or clip on the adjustable shoulder strap. The top zips together with a zipper on both sides so you do not have to use one zipper to go all the way around. The inside has no pockets wish it had at least one large one, but is roomy enough for quite a few skeins of yarn. There is a large pocket on the outside along with a few smaller ones where you could put crochet hooks or needles. The top has 2 slits for yarn to pass through without getting all tangled up I am really good at getting yarn tangled; ugh, and you could feasibly put 4 different colors through the slots each slot has a hole on each end if you are doing a project with different colored yarns.

This will now be my goto bag for my knitting/crocheting group. Right now I have 3 large skeins of yarn inside the bag along with my current crochet project. In the outside pockets I have some crochet hooks and accessories. I am really liking this bag and I am sure any knitter/crocheter would. My only suggestion might be to put in a few more pockets; I can never have enough of them.  Happy face smiley

249364,"Absolutely one of the best games I have ever played!  My wife and I play this game constantly.  Although it might seem complicated at first, the mechanics and rules are actually really simple and intuitive.  After one play, we were very comfortable with developing different strategies.  There is really no luck involved in this game  everything is based on your decisions, so if you are into games where you can strictly try to outplay your opponent, this is the game for you.  There are a lot of characters/factions to choose from and each seems to be pretty balanced with what they bring to the table, so replayability is very high.

The artwork is fantastic, and the pieces are very wellmade.  I really appreciate the fact that they seemed to go out of their way to make the artwork great even the back of the game board is beautifully decorated.

This is another game that comes with a LOT of pieces.  I built some trays out of foam core to hold everything and it makes set up and clean up much less of a hassle.

If you are a casual gamer, this one might seem more complicated and involved than other workerplacement games, but it is still really fun and definitely worth the time to learn and play.",Fantastic Game

48489,"Leave It All To Me Theme from iCarly is a bouncy song that typifies the 35 total tracks. The release includes music and cast dialogue from the show and songs that add some spice to the album's pretty standard concept of marketing an audio version of a TV show.

As with the program, this is a venue to spotlight the incredible talent of actress/singer Miranda Cosgrove, who is setting a foundation for a solid career in the entertainment industry. There is crossover appeal due to the mix of songs and dialogue, hence this is a ""safe"" release to give to a young person who may not be acquainted with the series, but is riding that pop culture wave at school.

114914,"Other than the darkness that comes with the 1880's London streets, I found this Sherlock Holmes movie excellent.  Its the first version I have seen of the Jack The Ripper case, where the movie does not depend on reenacting the grisly murders. Instead of getting caught up and distracted by visual scenes of blood and violence, you are allowed to focus on the way in which an intelligent investigator applies his knowledge and logic to connect the clues and unravel the scroll of mystery.

The acting might be somewhat dry by American standards, but that could be a plus. Without the hollywood tricks to entice the senses, the descriptive english language of the period gives the story so much intelligence and truthfulness.

Murder By Decree is truly a thinking persons movie that requires attention, as well as reasoning, in order to follow the methods of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Christopher Plummer and James Mason make a very fun pair to travel through London with.

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I have tried a number of highend shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it is just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they are just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I do not really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it is a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

51323,"This this is very heavy, but you are not buying an otter box if you are looking for streamlined good looks and lightweight materials, they are designed for serious use, and can take drops no electronic device should expect to survive. I have only had my iPad a week and it has already flown off my dash, hitting my shifter, then slamming to my truck floor. Good thing I have an otter box.

My main complaint is the 3 viewing angles need a fourth. You can only have the iPad vertically in the portrait orientation, if you try to use it vertically in the landscape orientation you have to put it in crooked and prop up one of the legs. It is a minor discomfort that means if you want to set your iPad up like a tv to watch at a standard viewing height, you have to do some propping.

The other reason they did not get four stars for this product is the fact that the screen protector is utterly useless. Until you design something better otter box, why give the consumer just another piece of plastic to throw away. That being said, the built in screen protector rips right out. I got the zagg shield, which is way better, but it is sticky, I just hate screen protectors in general.

The case is easy to put on if you are familiar with otter box, this is my third case of theirs so I did not have any trouble.",Could use a vertical landscape viewing angle.

63369,"This delightful book combines history with a travel narrative. Captain Cook made three Pacific voyages between 1768 and 1780 to every part of the Pacific, discovering countless lands, bolstering British claims of sovereignty, and creating maps of surprising accuracy. Horwitz, with his alcoholseeking sidekick and travel companion Roger Williamson,  retraces Cook's voyages, relying mainly on air travel, and inquires how Cook is regarded in historical hindsight in the various places he explored. Obviously the indigenous peoples of the Pacific view him negatively, and Horwitz examines both the proCook and the antiCook perspectives.

Areas visited by the author include Tahiti, New Zealand, eastern Australia, Niue, Tonga, and Hawaii, as well as Yorkshire and London in England. My favorite part was Horwitz's account of his visit to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, where yearround storms make travel dangerous even in large modern ships. One marvels that an 18th century explorer in a primitive wooden vessel would make a similar voyage, knowing that even if all went well, it would still take a year to return to England.

The book was a bit overlong in places. In some instances, I felt I was reliving Horwitz's travel experiences in real time. But all things considered, this is a wonderful interweaving of history and travelogue.",Wonderful synthesis of travelogue and history

The four star rating is due to the fact that the paint is very thin, and I would prefer a more medium body. This will go fast.  It would be great if this package omitted the black and white and replaced them with two more unique colors that are not easily mixed with primaries.

49843,"I have been a Spyro fan since the 80's, and have nearly every CD, except the compilations. This is a very welcome mix of
styles from the band, and everyone seems to be in top playing form, despite all the years that have passed. I would give this review
five stars had it not been for the recording quality. In most cases Spyro Gyra recordings have been pretty clean, with levels set
accurately and an overall great sound. However this particular recording, in a new venue, with new engineers....definitely has
something to be desired. Trust me.....I am not an audiophile snob, but I do have a pretty nice set up. I think I am able to tell when
the problem is not with me or my system .  In this case I actually tried to make adjustments to render the sound more accurately.
  Overall the engineering is not bad, but for some reason Jay Beckenstein's sax seems levelled way to high, and when the entire
band is jamming at full strength.... the sound is just, well....distorted. It is a bit fuzzy and not well defined. And with today's excellent
recording equipment, etc.  there is just no reason that should be the case.  I guess it is a bit more evident on headphones that it
is through speakers, but it is evident none the less.  So, bottom line for me is, the music is just fine.....but the recording could use
some fine tuning. But certainly do not let that stop you from enjoying new stuff from one of the longest lasting ""smooth jazz / pop
jazz"" bands to ever exsist.",Nice New Variety of Songs

On the flip side, if you plugged this into a device for long term power measurement, that tightness is great. I was testing Christmas lights.

I know other reviewers have complained about the 6 minute runtime, but I do not think it is that big of a deal. It seems to run at full power right up until the battery goes dead. And if you need to use it for more than 6 minutes on a single charge, you probably should be using a fullsize vacuum instead.

My only complaint is that I cannot use attachments from my upright Dyson DC14 Animal.

The plot centers around a small group of 'mutants,' long before the 'XMen' made them cool, who have the unique ability to scan the thought patterns of others, thus knowing what people are thinking. However, as always, not all mutants play nice, as actor, Michael Ironside, has a great role as the demented Revok, who likes to scan people's minds just a bit too long, leading one to lose one's head, as in the infamous exploding head scene! Revok leads his bands of rebel mutuants against the establishment, and only another Scanner with equal ability can stand in his way.

230286,"I have recently repainted the majority of my house and, like I have done in the past, I went straight for the blue tape.  I have been a Scotch man most my life adult life that is and I am usually loyal unless I have been burned.  Well, with this hefty project underway I decided to try my hand at the new Edge Lock Blue Tape, feeling confident that it will do what it promises.  In the past, using the standard Blue tape, I have never had a problem with bleeding occasional, but nothing drastic and so I trusted that this new breed would be better than the last.  Sadly, it was worse.  For a tape that promises edge lock protection, I have NEVER in my life had so much bleed through.  The tape's adhesive was not up to par and the big reveal felt overshadowed by the noticeable bleeding.  I was outraged, to put it lightly.  All my hard work felt ruined by this pack of lies.  If the product had been a carbon copy of the previous, that would have been a letdown but nothing detrimental.  The fact remains that this product is WORSE than the one that came before it.  Stay far away from this tape.  Not only is it of poor quality, but it costs more than the standard Blue Tape, which works far better.","LIES, LIES, LIES!!!"

But we also got this game and a few others so needless to say, I played Nintendo games for the rest of my Christmas vacation and this was one of the games that dominated the machine.

You can play 1 vs. 1 or fight all the way up to meet ""The Great Puma"" in this one.  How scarey is it that I remember!I used to play as either 'Amazon', a wrestler that had two special moves  chomping on the face of his opponent and... I forgot the other, but he used to look at the referre when told to stop and shake his head, promising not to do it again.  I also used to wrestle as Starman because he used to fly off the top ropes and his rope work was always pretty entertaining, although if you missed it was bad news for him.  There were others too that I liked but those were the main ones.  The game was a bit easy to finish once you figured out the 'secret'.  But it still provided loads of fun.

I still recommend it.  It is a very simple, neat, classic Nintendo game that provided lots of fun.  There was not any blood or gore in it like the wrestling games of today and you could not whack people with chairs, etc... this was an old 1980's game, for better or worse, and it is one that me and my family enjoyed.",The Memories!

Dropped the hose in the grass and the brass fitting with the spray head popped off.  The weld to hold it on broke.

40692,"By this point, the instrumentalists had gelled into a tight unit, what little looseness may have been found on ""The Real Thing"" is gone, but most importantly, vocalist Mike Patton is clearly integrated into the band and is obviously more comfortable, both with himself and the material I suspect.  The result is stunning Patton delivers vocals of endless diversity, everything from straighforward rock singing, screaming, rapping, crooning, and even some of the vocalizations that became much more prevelent on his later work.

The material on ""Angel Dust"" moves through a number of moods, and is at its best when its at its most experimental take standout track ""RV"", a song from the point of view of a middleaged white trash father, spoken word vocals alternating with extraorindary singing over a countryish jazz sound, or ""Small and Smaller"", which pulls you in with its grunting bass and brilliant vocalizations and really is the sort of melodrama the band excels at.

Admittedly, there is quite a bit of straightforward material, but much of it is of consistently high quality ""Land of Sunshine"", the haunting ""Midlife Crisis"", ""Everything's Ruined"".  In fact, what little is uninteresting is always saved by either great bass work ""Kindergarten"", vocals ""Caffeine"", or outside guitar noise ""Malpractice"".

Granted, there is a couple misses ""Be Aggressive"", with its cheerleader vocals sounds like a better idea on paper than it is on record and ""Jizzlobber"" is kind of a mess although still fairly enjoyable, but all in all, this is a great album.  Recommended.",Unique and interesting record.

46510,"I know I could get punched for saying this, but I like this CD even better than their first one Shake Your Money Maker but yes, I love that one also.  Being a guitarist, I love the guitar work on By Your Side. The guitar riffs by Rich Robinson are catchy and heavy throughout the CD.  Chris sounds fantastic and enthusiastic.  There is scarcely a dud on the entire CD.  The feel of the CD is very upbeat and optimistic.  There are radiofriendly songs such as Kicking My Heart Around, Go Faster and a couple others, but there are also great songs that you would probably never hear on the radio.  Some hot spots for me include Go Tell the Congregation, By Your Side, Then She Said My Name, Virtue  Vice, Heavy.  If you like rock  roll, I do not see what you would not like about this CD.

159966,"I am far from skinny, however, I really like to dance! My friend from work told me about this game, and after I researched it, I decided to buy it. So far...so good! I am loving Just Dance 2! It is a pretty good workout too, which is what I mostly do it for. I usually play the Just Sweat feature, which is nice because you can start with 1 song, or do 3, or dance to 6, which is what I usually do.

As much I love this game, I have two ""negative"" comments about it. First, sometimes the Wii remote does not pick up all of my moves even though I am doing them exactly. Second, some of the songs are a little random and not really fun to dance to. Like I said, I use this game mostly for a workout, so my opinion is coming from that sense. I like upbeat songs where I can move fast for exercise, and although I wish Just Dance 2 had more upbeat songs, I have to remember not everyone is doing this to workout like I am. If that is the case, you will definitely have fun just dancing by yourself or with your friends.

192202,"This is a very good, generalist office type color laser printer. It does very well with business graphics. Manual feed is a tiny bit tricky but not bad. Install is easy if you know how to install a WPS printer on your network. Note that Apple routers have no button and you will need to look through the menus to find the ""connect to WPS printer"" option. it does not do well with photographs but illustrations in documents look very good. The glossy paper you can get for this is really only 32lb even though they say 80lb  apparently different kinds of paper is rated differently but it tends to be double sided. It is thick enough to look good but do not count on printing card stock. Card stock tops out at 43lb and that is hard to find.

3/14/17 Having cycled through a set of toner cartridges, a couple of things have cropped up which are quite annoying. First, the printer has the habit of suddenly stopping accepting jobs for no apparent reason, though it could be related to being low but not out of one of the toner cartridges. This usually results in 20 minutes of fiddling and power cycles before the printer decides to start working. Second Brother tech support has been totally ineffective at offering any reason for this. They seldom actually read my questions and typically respond after days or even weeks with canned responses that do not address the issues. So you might want to avoid this printer based on this mysterious failure mode and the lack of a good tech support system.","Great for a low cost Color Laser Printer, best for business graphics and text"

I want to give 5 stars, I really do.  The boys even know the sound this bottle makes when you pick it up and the plankton rattle against the sides.  They come zooming across their tanks, frantically jumping up and down, waving their arms, begging like you would not believe a turtle can!

I had to remove 1 star because the plankton lose their color and become virtually invisible after a minute or two.  They are wasted when this happens because the turtles cannot find them.  They end up clogging the filter or stuck on the bottom, creating a slightly fishy smell in the tank until the water is changed.  That is quite a hassle!!

Another issue is that the quantity is NOT as advertized.  I would only fed 1/3 of the plankton to the boys when I reached the powder.  I do not know if the plankton itself is so delicate it disintegrated into powder due to rough handling or if the powdered plankton was included intentionally, but it cannot be used.  All it would do is ruin the tanks if I put it in the water; the boys cannot possibly chase down and eat each grain.

The main character is really wonderful and someone that most women can relate to. You find yourself really rooting for her and hoping she realizes how much she is loved and valued by those around her. I found myself liking the supporting characters as wellthey all felt like real people to me. I especially loved Andi's best friend and her husband and how supportive both of them were of Andi. I loved the humor in the book, too. Andi gets into all kinds of scrapes and many situations I could totally identify with. The one at the doctor's office made me laugh. This is a great book that deals with the gap between how we see ourselvesespecially those of us that struggle with our weightversus how others see us, and the challenge of letting our selfesteem be determined by who we are, rather than how we look.

As someone else noted, I had hoped to use this on a second computer that has yet to be purchased. Unfortunately, you only have 30 days to install this for a second or third user  something that should be clearer to consumers. My biggest issue has to do with tweaking some of the settings. I access my office server via my personal laptop using the Kaspersky and cannot find a way to avoid the repeated warnings every time I need to retrieve a document. I am pretty computer savvy and have yet to find a way to make my work server a trusted source to avoid this, which slows down my work productivity. Same thing applies to my digital camera card. It is annoying to have to go through extra steps for every individual photo I want to transfer to my computer. Again, if there is a way to disable this for selected sources, I have yet to find it.

 Small, compact, and lightweight. Perfect for travel and everyday use.
 Feels extremely wellmade. Durable. I really like the weight. It is not
too heavy, but you can tell it is great quality.
 Lasts a long time. Can easily keep my iPhone 5 juiced up when traveling
home during the week.
 Handy laser pointer and flashlight. Though not necessary, it is a nice
addon.
 This is a big one. The charging cable is the SAME cable to charge both
the device itself, as well as charge my other devices. No more AC wall adapter.
Cannot stress enough how great it is to only carry one cable.

184382,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

The descriptions of the hedge fund and trading strategy turned the world of investing and an algorithm into a living entity. The book was entertaining and thought provoking following the most recent world financial calamity.  It struck me that there is the potential that we are building an algorithm that will run the economy and just like the Titanic, we may all sink when it hits the proverbial iceberg.","Exciting, Enlightening and Thought Provoking!"

But before doing so, I decided to read some of the reviews and saw that the ingredients had been changed and many people said it tasted bad. So instead of  the KAL brand, I ordered SweetLeaf Stevia Extract Powder. BIG MISTAKE!!! The little .9 oz bottle says that it has 1000 servings in it, so I figured I only needed less than half of the tiny spoon that came in the KAL brand the Sweetleaf Powder did not come with a measuring spoon, but instead said that a serving size was 1/80 teaspoon. How on earth can you measure that? Anyway, 1/2 of the tiny spoon did not sweeten my coffee in the least. For the next cup, I used a full tiny spoonful. It still it did not taste sweet to me, but I decided not to add more as I was afraid I would make the coffee bitter. The coffee was drinkable, but afterwards I had a bad taste in my mouth. I would not buy this brand again! So once again I am back to my search for the best tasting stevia powder. I have already tried more brands then I can even remember and only KAL has ever met my approval.","Not sweet at all, and it left a bad aftertaste in my mouth"

184985,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible.

Installation was straightforward using the code inside the package to download from the McAfee site.  Took about 15 minutes for installation.  Setup was simple and McAfee runs unobtrusively in the background.  Also installed on my HTC One Android phone easily.  No problems so far after two months.  My only concern is that after each Windows automatic update, the PCs slow down a bit but NOT solely due to McAfee; that happens with all brands of security suites after Windows updates.

Father does not accept the boy because Moojie does not talk or walk like a normal child. His father leaves him to live at St. Isadore's Fainting Goat Dairy.

77448,"Needed something in the car that could charge my iPhone and the wife's Droid Razr at the same time. This item arrived super quickly and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they included a USBtomicro USB cable in the box.

The charger fit snugly and securely into my Subaru Forester's charging port the Powergen charger of the same type was very loose and floppy in the socket. The charger glows a cool blue when activated.

Hooked up my iPhone to the 2.1 amp port and the wife's Razr to the 1 amp port with the included cable.  iPhone charged great. Nothing happened with the Razr. As it turns out and from reading other reviews, the included cable is very low powered and will not charge certain smartphones.  No biggie to us since we had our own cables anyway, but they should have been more clear about this in the documentation to avoid confusion. Charger works great with both the OEM Motorola cable and also a cheap Mediabridge cable I got on Amazon. We get quick power for two devices.

So works great for two heavy smartphone users who are on the go often. Just do not count on the included cable to charge everything.",Great dual charger

235203,"I guess I am more a Western saw person in that I like a push saw because the sawdust does not interfere with the marking gauge line.  I am getting  used to this one which is incredibly sharp and cuts very well and gives a nice thin kerf.  It is not a high dollar saw but certainly works as well as one that a friend owns.  It is slightly short but for joinery, it is plenty long enough.  The handle is plastic and has a turn knob to exchange blades.  However, it does not do any good because the packaging was all Japanese and you do not have any idea how to get a new blade.  Fortunately, they are inexpensive enough that I will probably get a new one to wait in the wings.  So far, I have made about 1015 hardwood dovetail boxes with it and have not lost a tooth or seen any dulling yet.

Edit as of a couple months after purchase :  I keep track and have now cut dovetails on 24 boxes with this saw and I have no desire for anything else.  I have used it on several hardwoods of different thicknesses and have not lost a tooth yet.  I am very pleased at how it has not lost any sharpness from the day I got it.  One of those rare cases where inexpense is not a comprimise.",Nice saw for the money

212268,"Even if you are upgrading from Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, it makes very little sense to buy this.  If you are upgrading from Windows Tongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry you can buy a new computer that is 20 to 50 times faster than your old computer and has enough memory at least 4GB to run newer programs more efficiently for 300 to 600 dollars.  You get Windows 8 included!

If you are upgrading from Windows 7, you actually lose the functionality of Windows Media Center since it is not included in Windows 8.  You would have to buy Windows 8 Pro Pack for another 89 dollars to get that functionality.

Since Windows 8.1 will address the Start Menu fiasco and will make keyboard and mouse navigation a little bit easier, you could buy this.  I would wait for the Black Friday and Christmas season for specials on Windows 8.1.  There will also probably be promotions after Windows 8.1's release around October 17th.

I do not recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 as an upgrade until Windows Media Center is included as part of the system.  I run two home entertainment computers and without Windows Media Center, they are useless.  Since you are actually losing functionality if you upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7, the only real benefit is an ""arguably"" slightly faster operating system and a few stray benefits such as Skydrive.  The tiled look is fine for phones and tablets, but you want productivity and an operating system built for a pc, not one built for a tablet or phone.",It makes no sense to buy this unless you are upgrading from Windows XP
127026,"D'Addario strings are awesome!  These strings speak with a bold,defined and POWERFUL voice.  The bass strings boom with thunderous lows and the treble strings glisten with sparkling highs without being too harsh.  They are very sweet to the ears and tonally balanced across the board without one frequency overpowering the other. I have tried a lot of different strings, DR's, Ernie Ball, Dean Markley, Elixir, GHS, you name it.  After putting a set of EXL110's 1046 gauge on my Gibson SG special faded and comparing them to Ernie Ball I noticed a huge difference, not only were they brighter but they lasted longer.  I used to change a set of Regular Slinkys every two months but with EXL's I was changing strings every five to six months. They work in a variety of applications, metal, hard rock, jazz, blues, reggae, etc. and respond great at any dynamic level.  D'Addario is ""The Player's Choice"" for a reason after using these I cannot see myself using anything else!  They feel good,sound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set. If you have not used them yet, give them a try and see what you are missing.",D'Addario is the way to go!
224245,"I ordered one of these earlier in 2011 from the companies actual website and was pleased with what we got and how fast it came. We put it on our metal hammock stand that sits half the day in the shade and half of it in the sun. It was comfortable to sit in and it supported really well.
About a month or less after having it the color was significantly faded. This was a little disappointing because I really liked the initial color. I know sun can fade things but this was dang fast. I made a sleeve to go on the hammock to help with the elements when we were not on it. It did help it not fade anymore and kept it pretty dry when it rained.
About 2 1/2 months after we bought it our 9 year old went to sit on it and the strings on one side snapped. He does not weigh more than 90 pounds and this hammock is rated for 500 lbs. There is no way this should have happened. When I contacted the seller Rada Hammocks via email I received no response what so ever.
I would not recommend buying anything from this company. I understand things like this will eventually wear down but it should not happen in 3 months during the summer with hardly any rain. I should not have to put it up and take it down after each and every use. This would just be annoying.
The only reason I give them two stars instead of one is because I did initially like the hammock until it feel apart.",It look nice... initially

171298,"The Highlander by Zoe Saadia is a comingofage novel detailing the relationship between two young men whose friendly rivalry develops into a competition reflecting that of their own nations. Kuini and Nezahuacoyotl meet each other in the wilderness and are fascinated in the ensuing exchange in culture. The Highlands are an alien world to the Lowlanders, and both communities have engaged in warfare against each other throughout their recorded history. Only when Coyotls sister Iztac is given to an Aztec ruler, it is done in the interests of peace although neither he nor Kuini can accept her fate. The two young warriors unite in a common goal that may affect the future of both nations entire.

Once again the author draws from her rich knowledge of Azteca history and folklore in providing an authentic and compelling backdrop to the narrative. Yet we find deeper issues being discussed, the foremost of which is womens rights and the freedom of choice. Iztac represents hundreds of millions of women to the present day forced into arrangements of convenience. We see both her halfbrother and her soulmate joined in a common goal to change her fate regardless of the impact upon their society and its mores. Saadia sees fit to explore the longterm effects of this decision, and that is what sequels are for.

The Highlander by Zoe Saadia is an inspirational and entertaining tale of romance and social change amidst one of historys most fabled societies. Pick up a copy and you will not be disappointed.",The Coyote and the Jaguar?

The screw holding the two pieces of the handle comes out if you are not careful so watch out. I will probably be tightening it in a minute or two today and watching it very carefully from now on.

206267,"I will try not to repeat all the negative comments of which I generally agree.  Office 2007 is not intuitive. If it was, Microsoft would not have gone to the great lengths it has to show users how to find the functions they are looking for  see their website.  I was forced to convert from 2003, which had its deficits but it was intuitive and it worked most of the time.

An example of problems with Word 2007: I have a simple table for printing file folder labels. When I tried to navigate around or select items text, rows, columns, etc., only the keyboard works, NOT THE MOUSE!  I spent an hour researching the problem and could not find a solution, only confirmation that you have to use the keyboard working on a table. Also the table now prints unwanted gridlines. Again I have spent far too long without success to prevent them from printing, changing a number of settings to no avail.

Word 2007 is the only program I have tried so far, but I dread trying to use the ""new"" Excel or Outlook.  I anticipate the learning curve will be huge. So far I see NO advantage to Office 2007.  If you are using 2003, do not change!!! I see nothing to gain and a lot to lose.",Thank Goodness Microsoft Doesn't Design Anything Important Like Planes or Cars!

156637,"This is a great game, the story reminds me of something Hollywood would come up with such as treasure in a jungle, well armed locals trying to stop you, and a sidekick reporter. The graphics are topnotch for an early PS3 title and the controls are intuitive. Since this is an ""Indiana Jones""esque title, there are, of course, puzzles and traps. The health meter is also inventive in that you do not have one, the screen slowly fades to black and white as you take damage. Many of the trophies are easily obtained since the majority are acquired through weapon usage and finding treasures. Now for the bad stuff. In the beginning, the difficulty is balanced. At about halfway through the game, it jumps when the enemies have unlimited ammo and the ability to cause head shots from very far away. This can be a problem when you are being swarmed. Also, many of the later puzzles can become needlessly difficult due to the camera, but once you figure them out you can easily finish them.

175968,"I purchased 3 different sizes in this slipper after reading reviews and not sure if they would be too big or too small. I would consider myself a 8.5/9 in my regular shoe size. I purchased a 39, 40, and 41 and never plan on wearing socks with these slippers. The 39 was definitely too small and could easily check that off my list. The 41 felt slightly too big, but maybe could work?? I was worried that if they stretched at all they would be annoying and hard to keep on my feet. The 40 initially felt a wee too snug in the back. I felt the back of my heel rubbing against the stitching and frankly did not know what to do. I continued to read more reviews and many people seemed to face the same problem and all said that after wearing the slipper over 24 hours the slipper stretched slightly and molded to their foot. Well, I made the decision and picked the 40. I wore them around the house, and sure enough, within an hour or so the rubbing went away and my foot fit perfectly in the slipper. They are now hands down the best slippers I have ever worn.

I have only ever worn shearlinglined slippers in the past and was super skeptical about these being able to keep my feet warm. However, my heel would always weardown the shearling after a year and they would become uncomfortable to walk on.  I have tried Ugg, Cabela's, LLBean  all the same. These keep my feet soooo warm!

Secondly, the bottom ""foot"" that contains the filter pad attaches to the pump body by pushing it on, i.e., it is just a friction fit, and it sometimes falls off when you disturb the pump. On the plus side, the 25' cord is a nice feature. I use a very simple trick to to keep it pumping when the water is full of debris like rotting leaves which otherwise would quickly clog the filter pad. I place the pump in the pouch of my leaf rake and use the long pole handle to place the pump wherever I want it. The leaf rake pouch, which resembles a bag made of fiberglas window screen acts as a prefilter and is very effective.

All my drumming years I have not found a better snare drum head than coated Ambassador... why is that? I thought it was my mind being used to or brought with that tone.

Remo is not as high tech... but man, they do sound great... a tone much less plasticky than other heads... the term ""warm"" is such a clich... but if there is a deserving piece of gear to give you a ""warm"" tone are these.

Recently ""good"" heads are those that any idiot can tune in 3 seconds...  But after using these in all toms tecently I have to say RESPECT.

I have all kinds of batter heads I use... Evans G2 clear and coated, Ec2, REMO vintage Emperor, Ambassador coated... all have their good qualities... this review is more geared towrads those in doubt and with a perception that these are obsolete or limited heads... it is a complete 180 from that.

Songs like Caribou, Vamos, Holiday Song, Nimrod's Son, Ed is Dead and Levitate Me all became Pixies concert staples and would belong on any Pixies ""best of"" compilation.

The amazing thing about this effort is how fully developed the Pixies sounded even at this young age.  All of the classic Pixies elements are present on Come On Pilgrim.  Black Francis' demented vocals about reincarnation, incest and whatever the hell else goes through that mind of his.  Kim Deal's outstanding bass playing and angelic backing vocals.  Joey Santiago's latin tinged surf rock guitar and David Lovering's versatile drumming.

If you want an idea of how incredible it is for a band to come out this strong on their first release, consider Radiohead's mediocre first album Pablo Honey or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs amateur sounding self titled first EP.

Packed with unforgettable songs, Come On Pilgrim is simply one of the most original and creative 20 minutes of indie rock that you will ever hear.",One of the Greatest Debuts in Rock History

42576,"I am not much of a fan of the cottage industry known as Henry Rollins, inc., but ""Weight"" has to be the musclebound exBlack Flag singer's best work after Black Flag, of course.

What makes this Rollins Band album work so well is the players and their chemistry. The lineup has since changed, but this incarnation of the band is solid and absolutely powerful. The addition of bassist Melvin Gibbs gives the band a fluid, jazzy rhythm foundation that locks in well with Sim Cain's drumming, and Chris Haskett let us loose with some of his best guitar playing. Haskett is a tasteful player who utilizes space and minimal amounts of notes for maximum impact, ala David Gilmour, which I suppose would not be an altogether unfathomable comparison. The grooves that the band creates almost comes close to upstaging its namesake at times, but Rollins still has plenty to shout about. There are only a few weaker tracks here""Tired,"" ""Step Back"" and ""Shine,"" which seems as if Rollins is preaching a bit too much in the latter. These tracks are weaker, lyrically, than what is expected from such a poetic lyricist as Rollins. Anger is the primary emotion Rollins is about in his lyrics, but he conveys it pretty well on ""Weight."" Songs like ""Disconnect"" and ""Civilized"" effectively communicate Rollins' anger and feelings of hatred toward those who have the misfortune of getting on his bad side.","rollins' finest moment, post Black Flag"

So, it was not unusual for me to opt to buy the Clark's listed here, as I have about 10 other pairs.

However I read the reviews critiquing the sizing.
Having recently purchased some sandals on Lands End that were way too wide, I heeded the comments here that indicated these shoes ran wide. As I have a size 10 foot but a bit on the narrow side, I ordered the 10 Narrow.  Normally I purchase medium.  The narrow size also was quite a bit cheaper.
They fit perfectly.
I have no complaints and really enjoy these shoes and thank the people that let me know they ran wide...so I am passing this on too.

They have a wonderful brushed leather sole that is wonderful against bare feet.
I also noted my Doctor has a pair, so they must be comfortable for the amount of standing she does daily.

I did note they do not have a pronounced arch and have a negligible heel.  This means I do have to be careful wearing them too much, as I have issues with heel spurs if I do not have either enough arch or enough heel.",They do run a bit wide

70786,"This book made me experience the following emotions: Sadness, anger, fear, and closer. The reason I felt all of these things is because I was closely connected to the Connolly family. The author really has a skilled talent for storytelling. Especially from a human aspect nature level.

Right from the moment I started reading to the last page I was hooked. Thus this made for a quick, easy read. I especially liked the way that the story went back in time at different periods in Jake's life. It gave me a better insight to just what type of person Jake is. Then there is the Connelly family. I like that they really bonded together and fought for Jake's honor even when the odds seemed against them. The subject matter of this book could have made this story depressing and dark but it was not. It was very wellwritten. I am looking forward to reading the next book by this author.

Yes, the likeness is great and it looks beautiful but due to some  unknown reasons they did not take physics into consideration while making this, the joints are bendable in both ways ""ex. the knee can bend to the front and the back"", the hands are very heavy to be carried by those small legs , the head weight is not helping either because it makes it harder to balance the figure in a standing pose.

199040,"I ordered this part for a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe as the original part failed when the fan continued to blow air when the car was shut off even when the key was not in the ignition.  I had to pull the cover off passenger side  2 7mm screws and unplug it so that it would not kill the battery.  I had originally ordered a more inexpensive part but it would not fit due to the fact that the 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe had dual automatic climate controls.  Amazon Prime shipping is the best and it is something that I highly recommend.  The part came in 2 days once I placed my order.  The original part had a 3 prong connector and the new part was not but the 3 wires in the Tahoe were the same color as the new part and so I had to cut the old connector off.  I then had to use a wire cutter to strip the 3 wires and I used 2 bunt connectors to connect the two larger wires.  I just used electrical tape to connect the smaller purple wires and then I taped all 3 wires together for additional support.  If I had some solder I would have used instead of the bunt connectors but the  black electrical tape worked just as well.
The part is working fine and Amazon does offer the best price for this item compared to my local parts store.",Perfect fit for a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe...with some minor cutting.

There are a lot of great features here, and they are included in the price even if you never plan to use them.

The latest Accounting offering from Microsoft almost anything you would expect from Peachtree or a similar competitor.  Microsoft was late to this game, but they definitely did their homework.  All of your favorite functions and then some are there.

Some of the better functions also require monthly fees.  The integrated eBay and Paypal functions are excellent if you take your selling on eBay seriously.  They also cost pay ten dollars a month to take advantage of, which will take a chunk out of your sales.

The main problem with the software, however, is that all those features you are not going to use are still slowing down the user experience.  The program is big, bloated and slow, like anything from Microsoft.  While competitor programs are not exactly lightweights either, Accounting Professional just feels too slow for comfort, even on a fast computer.

The features, integration with the rest of Office and Windows, and the price may be attractive to many users.  The monthly fees, bloat, and a desire for a more mature product will turn others off.

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

56788,"I have used many USB flash drives over the years and LOVE the retractable connection on this unit. Other models I own have the USB connection permanently extended and come with a cover that always gets lost. Then the flash drive picks up fuzz and other contaminants in my computer bag when traveling that ultimately end up in the USB connection on my computer when I use the drive leading to damage. By allowing me to retract the connection, Transcend has spoiled me forever and I will only buy this type of drive in the future. To use the drive you simple slide out the connector and plug it in. Once extended it locks into place until you want to put it away and then a slight pressure on the slide will allow you to retract the USB connector for storage. The 32gb size is perfect for today's dataintensive applications and provide enough space for me to carry all my files as well as a few movies and TV shows for the plane. Also, the flash drive is fast enough to play these shows right from the unit and does not require me to transfer them to my computer for viewing.

Junk.
Krp.
No way to anchor them sufficiently without damaging factory paint on the hinge points. I even tried using nylon washers but if the nylon softens the mount enough to protect the paint, then the mirror is too loose. If the mounting is done tight enough to be solid then the nylon washers all crush anyway and the paint gets damaged again.
Even if they were able to mount sufficiently tight, the metal arm itself is too flimsy; it vibrates and shimmies too much to be usable.

186686,"It works and was able to set it up to work with wifi. However, it is slow, it does not always work does not always print, it is eats ink like crazy, it hold very very little paper at a time, you cannot add paper while printing, it could be massively improved upon...
I wish they still made the old cannon pixma this was replacing. The lack of a linear feed is unfortunate meaning you cannot use many papers in this. It uses a tray on the very bottom very thin, extremely cheap feeling that the paper does not fit snugly in. It is not convenient for switching to labels or different kinds of paper or knowing how much paper you  have left. It only holds a very small amount of paper at a time. To access the tray, you have to close the print out tray.
It has a kind of cheap feel over all.
For seemingly no reason it will just not print sometimes or completely fail to respond. scanning does not seem very reliable either.",it's an OK ink-eating block of a printer.

255300,"If you want a microscope that you will be able to focus, prepare your own slides, and actually enjoy, do not buy this one!  This is extremely cheaply made.  It looks great on the box and it comes with tons of little accessories some prepared slides, some empty slides, a box, a thing to squeeze liquid with, etcwhich is nice.  For small kids that just want to play and pretend more than actually see stuff, this is fine.  For my son, who is almost ten and loves science, this was very disappointing.  It was nearly impossible to focus on the slides that were included.  It was nothing more than a frustration for us.  After ten minutes of messing with it, we decided it was just going to take up space on the shelf.

I would not recommend this.  I gave it two stars only because I think it could be played with as a toy for kids that want to pretend to be a scientist, but if you want a real microscope that is easy to focus, spend some more money and buy something better!","It is a toy, nothing more."

I have used it to make prime rib and also Thanksgiving turkey. I think the last turkey I used was 17 lbs. and it fit nicely however I do not use the lid. It comes with a rack which is really nice. The handles make it easy to lift the food out of the pan. The lid can be used as a chafing dish. I have used it to cook the au jus from the prime rib on my stove top.

The old paper was therefore put directly on gypsum and had stuck beyond belief. The paper separated leaving behind a layer of glue and paper that tenaciously held on to the gypsum. Using a spray bottle with warm water I would spray and area and let soak for several minutes.

I still had to work at certain areas with short jabbing strokes but all in all the job would have been an nightmare without the tool.

226880,"Fantastic small tool. I needed to cut two garden hose antisiphon valves that were rusted in place. One issue is that with brute force you may twist the actual bib coming out of the wall and now bigger trouble. My air compressor hose could reach one valve so I started cutting and I was finished in less than 30 seconds of grinding! The second one I would need to use my portable drill, which is much slower. I anticipated a long and difficult task; NOT! It took me maybe 12 minutes and it was finished. A pair of pliers or better, a pair of channel locks and you pull back on the small cut portion using the main body as the second ""bite"" area and it pulls away like soft clay. You can watch this on your favorite video site showing ""how to's.""
Now I installed new Valterra A010141VP antisiphon valves also from Amazon and they work much better than originals. No leaking,easy to install and remove as they are well made plastic. That equals no corrosion and no locking screw to rust onto your hose bib! Good Luck.",Fantastic Tool

117433,"Josef Von Sternberg was in love with, and frustrated by, Marlene Dietrich. His obsession reached its apotheosis in ""The Devil is a Woman"". Miss Dietrich declared it her personal favorite of their 7 films together ""I was at my most beautiful"", and vehemently denied that the film was a reflection of their somewhat strange relationship. Since Miss Dietrich's passing, it has come to light that this film was a reflection of their relationship. Von Sternberg photographed this film himself, and Dietrich does look impossibly beautiful, like an evil goddess. Her costumes codesigned by Travis Banton and Dietrich are masterpieces of fantasy Hollywood/Spanish. The sets, lighting, photography, costuming, et al combine to make a glittering vision of a very sad and painful story. Von Sternberg announced that he and Miss Dietrich were to go their separate waystheir last few films, this one especially, did poorly at the box officethe Spanish government wanted this film DESTROYED! To call this film ""exaggerated"" is like calling opera ""exaggerated"". Oh course it is! This was not intended to be a documentary, or a ""slice of life"". However, under all of its baroque extravangance ,lies ""The Awful Truth"". I think all of us have either been in a similar situation, or know someone who has been in a similar situation.

132254,"As a toaster this is of acceptable quality, barely.  First it is not nearly the size indicated. Those measurements include2 2"" metal posts on the back to keep it from resting against the wall. It is really 9 1/2 x 13 1/2 X 8 1/2 which was what I really wanted anyway but is much smaller than advertised. The  toast donness dial is way off when you get it but becomes more accurate in time. I suspect they all are like that and I have no problem figuring out where to set it to get toast the way I like it. It produces more smoke than any other toaster oven I have had.
 As an oven it might be unusable for most people. There is no control to set the temperature. I use a toaster oven for heating and baking to avoid heating up the main over and taxing the AC. If you use yours to bake potatoes for instance does it stay on until it gets to 500 or does it self regulate to a preset nonadjustable and unknown temperature?

165153,"Hackett has a serious problem and his therapist by the name of Loebner is not helping at all.  Hackett has told him again and again that his dream every night is always the same. Hackett dreams that a mysterious caller rings him up and tells him he has to drive to Cleveland. In his dream he gets dressed and goes out to his car where a briefcase is waiting for him on the passenger seat. He drives the briefcase to Cleveland and then drives back. Since the very real drive takes four hours to get there and four hours to get back it is exhausting.

Hackett needs help and Loebrer is not doing much to help him. Telling his dream over and over again is not doing any good. Something has to change.

This is one of those short stories where one thinks it is going to go one way and instead it goes in a far different direction. Once that is accomplished author Lawrence Block ups the ante by throwing in a couple of more twists. Cleveland in My Dreams is a fast and ultimately very funny read.

This short story ebook also includes Chapter One of the new book The Burglar Who Counted Spoons.

Material was picked up during the authors recent free read promotion for my use in an objective review.

74904,"I purchased this case after tearing up two Otterbox defender cases within one year. I work in a steel mill and spend my time outdoors so I need a rugged case to protect my second brain.

I only use the she will case without the rubber around it so I cannot offer a fair review of that part or the holster. Both seem well built but I have not used them.

The base plastic she will offers great protection from drops,dirt and grime yet is still small enough to fit in my pocket.
The  case is smooth enough to slide in and out of my pocket easily yet still has enough grip to keep it from sliding around on a smooth surface.
The  case is firmly snapped together around the phone but can be opened very easily when needed unlike the puzzle of a case otterbox made.

The downside to this case is the cosmetics could be better. It has a shiny plastic look on the front that looks cheap and I have found that the hole for the headphone buds is to small for some plugs. The hole for the charger is to small also for some cords.

If the looks were improved and the holes fixed this would be a 5 star product.",Great case!

Metal hooks without the Soft Touch handle can be hard on the hands, and plastic hooks, while having a little flex that is better for hands, can also be less sturdy  while teaching a friend to crochet, he snapped a plastic one in half!

40997,"I have seen reviews that say this album suffers from childlike lyrics and simple concepts. I say, ""So What?"" It sounds great and it is full of hooks. It is definitely evocative of the Beach Boys' Sunflower album to me, with its breezy feel and gorgeous harmonies. All the standard instrumental highlights are there  bass clarinets, sleigh bells, flutes, all those sounds that make me think of the Pet Sounds album.

 My favorites after the first couple listens are ""Soul Searchin"", with a very emotional Carl Wilson vocal; ""A Friend Like You"", with Paul McCartney, which could have been lifted off of McCartney's ""Flowers in the Dirt""; and ""Fairy Tale"" best lyrics on the album. The Eric Clapton guitar work on ""City Blues"" does not work for me, and comes off as too heavyhanded, like Eric is trying to show that he can still rock also see Toots and the Maytals ""True Love"" for other evidence of this.

 But, like everyone else has said, give Brian Wilson credit for just being able to do this, let alone produce something that sounds this good.","Boy, this sounds good"

All tracks are nearly flawless, the centerpiece being ""Whale and Whasp,"" an instrumental that does what so many contemporary rock instrumentals do: make you think.
The song rivals Nine Inch Nails' ""A Warm Place"" for best pop composition of the 90s. The song makes an unexpected turn at the end with a jazz/blues number, ""Swing On This,"" which makes one think of Layne's then inability to fight heroin addiction.
Quite possibly the saddest Iwant togowriteasong song ever, ""Nutshell"" never gets old in the fact that it applies to someone somewhere in the world each time you hear it. As Layne moans the lines ""if I cannot be my own, I would feel better dead,"" you cannot help but thank God that his tormented life is over.
Rest In Peace, Layne, You Left Us All With A Legacy.",One of the most disturbingly relaxing albums ever...

This unit is designed to be used with different brush heads all over the body.

This package includes 2 brush heads face and body, the Smart Profile unit, USB Charger and directions.

There are fake Clarisonic units on the market. And some of them look good visually though they do not tend to work well or last. I did due diligence on this one checking all the signs and this is a genuine unit. When you purchase a Clarisonic avoid to good to be true offers and work with an authorized dealer to make sure you are getting the real thing. Amazon is an authorized dealer.  If you plan to purchase from Amazon, purchase directly through them.

The one drawback to this unit is there is no stand for it. There used to be one but apparently they had issues with it. I do think they should make a stand for it. It is more hygienic.

64274,"I was not impressed at all. A close friend read this in its native Japanese and found the description to be so beautifully written that it came highly recommended. However, in my 45 years of prolific reading, this story came across as tedious. The descriptions were overly long and minute details, although often very important to a masterful story or poem became unbelievably tedious and myopic.

I believe the problem is with the translation, as apparently many other translations of Master Murakami are apparently quite compelling. Others have said similar things so I am confident I am not off the mark.

The storyline itself was interesting and the title, 1Q84 if you understand Japanese is brilliant. There is great potential in this story, and many of the historical points discussed and the locations are of personal interest to me as I have lived in Japan for 25 years and actually been to the stations, and towns used.

The beam of light it produces is very good for a 2 C cell battery powered flashlight.

So I removed them, cut an inch of rubber off with a hacksaw, and put them back on.  I am still hitting them when I should not be, so my leaf springs must be sagging.  They do not look like they are sagging, but I have 220,000 miles over lots of forest roads, so I will replace my leaf springs.  However, even with new springs, I do not think a 4"" bump stop can be called an OEM part.

So I rate it ""okay"" because it is easily modified to meet OEM sizing, but not standard right out of the box.","Not OEM height, But Can Be Cut Down"

66524,"Richard Bach may be one of those authors which one either loves dearly, or loathes unconditionally; he can occasionally come across as overlyhokey and melodramatic, but his stories are wellcrafted and deeply personal.
_The Bridge Across Forever_ may be the best book he is written yet, and is an excellent way to expose oneself to his style of writing; it was the first book of his which I read, and it caused me to run right out and snatch up all the others I could find. I have not yet found one that surpasses this one, but almost all of them contain wonderful gems and insights.
_Bridge_ is a rich, warm story about slightly metaphysical connections in life, through time, space, and personal growth. As he writes of his future wife, Leslie, the absolute love he feels for her is crystalclear, and may at times bring tears to the reader's eyes. His love of flying is beautifullyportrayed as well, and he does a wonderful job of introducing the reader to the absolute joy and freedom of being airborne. In fact, Bach's descriptions of nearly everything are alive and vibrant, putting the reader Right There in that moment with him.
It is easy to recognize Truth when we see it  this book is full of truths that we perhaps always knew, but did not quite know that we knew  it is that kind of book. I really recommend this to anyone who does not absolutely detest probing books with a real soul.","Rich, warm, and compelling"

I part thin sections and keep doing that until I do not see my scalp. It covers my gray a lot too. I have not dyed my hair in years. I use to have medium to dark brown hair but now I have a lot of gray too. I do not dye it now because it is thinning. This stuff makes my hair look a lot less gray. It does make your hair feel a little weird but it looks great! I love the fibers but I love this even more. I sometimes use them together. The spray is much quicker and easier for me to use.

134628,"It has been a few months since I started using this rod and I am loving it very much. My shower wall is about 60"" wide and this adjustable rod holds onto the wall well and does not slide down.

I love the simple, smooth design of the rod. It is adjustable and where the two rods connect is a smooth bump so my curtain hooks glide over the hump without getting stuck, which makes opening and closing the curtains easy.

The finish is a nice bronze. Some reviewers have mentioned the two connecting rod pieces so not match color. It is such a discernible difference and you hardly notice the color difference. And once you have the curtain and hooks on, you cannot even see the subtle difference in color.

Other notable feature is that the two ends where they push against the walls are not bulky and big like those curves rods have. Curved Ross need a bigger surface area to support the curved rods and hence the ends have huge pieces. This is a straight rod and the ends are nicely small and has a simple look I prefer.

If you are thinking of getting a curved rod to gain more room, I suggest getting this straight rod and installing it a couple inches farther out of the bath tub so the curtain falls still within the tub area but you will gain a few more inches of elbow room. I did that and it worked out perfectly. And it gave me just as much room as a curved rod did.

I am thoroughly satisfied with this rod and highly recommend it.",Sturdy rod with a nice bronze finish

It is really easy to use software, no more difficult than entering transactions into your check book registry, but these you can search with any word. I can print out reports of payments made to my insurance or who ever to show that payments were made when there is a dispute. I download all my credit card transactions right into Quicken, all my banking transactions get downloaded right into the proper registry. I cannot even imagine not having Quicken or anything being easier or more complete to use.",Surprised at the comments of problems

122376,"I do not know if these are refurbished or what... I have used nothing but Planet Waves cables for the past 8 years. During that time I had ONE of them go bad on me. ONE in 8 years. I bought two of these and they both went bad after only two or three months.

213507,"I have several photo programs on my computer and several others that I did not care for laying around. My favorite, easiest to use and quickest one to use has been the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10. I also have the Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and I have used it for my more advanced editing.
  Now this Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 takes the place of both of them. All the basic editing functions are pretty much intuitive and easy to find and use. It will switch from photo archive to basic editing to advanced editing and back to archive very easily. It comes with a book showing how to use it and there are online tutorials for its use too. I have not got very far into its more advanced uses yet but I think this will be the last photo program I will need for a long time.
  There is just one thing that I did not like about it and the installation of it. And that is it does not give you any choice, it takes over, on its own, and it goes through the entire hard drive collecting ever image file on it and puts them all in its photo archive. I would much rather be able to have the CHOICE of which photos and folders to put in its archive. But then that is something that just about every photo program I have ever tried does when its first installed.
  So if you want something more than just the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10, or something to go with it, I suggest trying this one.",A nice user friendly program for my digital pictures

210797,"Through the last 20 years my husband and I have used a lot of office software. Right now, WordPerfect is my default, and OpenOffice is his. However, he switches to WordPerfect office for some specific things, and I do not use OpenOffice for anything, because WordPerfect does everything I need.
It saves nicely in a lot of formats and has all the applications you expect from a good office suite. It is intuitive to use, and common enough that if you do get stuck, it is easy to find a solution to the problem without having get customer support.
Where WordPerfect excels for me, and the reason my husband switches to it every so often is in straight word processing. In this, it is so much better than Microsoft Office. Most of my writing is craft instructions, and it was easy to create the various templates I wanted, and it is easy to format the documents professionally.
About PDFs I do not use the program to make PDFs, my husband does and he is happy with the pdfs he makes using it. Generally I save in .doc format then create the pdfs using Acrobat for greater control and the ability to add in fillable text fields easily.
I still prefer the full version, because a lot of my use is commercial, and the Home and Student edition is not meant to be used that way. However, it has the same functions, and works just as well at a lower price making it a great choice for students.",Good product for students!

150553,"I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 24 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

198931,"seems nice because everybody knows how good BLACK ICE SMELLS
heck i remember the first time i smelled black ice, i thought wow, this smells like regular ice, but is black. definitely a much stronger smell than unfrozen water or other colors of ice.

The reason for the one star however is because unfortunately having the air freshener turns out to be a bad idea in the winter  you cannot smell the black ice coming up on the road, and everyone knows how hard it is to see. with the smell of black ice all around you, you are never going to notice the smell of the ice on the road until it is too late.

The Trimax has a very simple design so there is less to gum up and a coating once a year of WD40 should be all it takes to keep it operating smoothly. The little plastic boot is a nice touch though time will tell if it stays on or does not deteriorate and fall apart.

208060,"In my review from: Sage 50 Premium Accounting Sage Peachtree 2013 [Old Version] CDROM, I wrote the following, which still applies to the 2014 version:
""I do not know why the makers decided to change the product name from Peachtree which everyone recognizes to Sage, but this does appear to be a wise upgrade to an already decent product. Tech support is good; Internet videos are good. So far Sage 50 Premium does everything I want it to do to run a duallocation business with inventory, branching out with Internet sales.""

Currently, I am using Sage 50 Premium Accounting 2014.  Installation was no problem. Setting up Accounts Payable  Accounts Receivable is straightforward, with the initial entering of information taking the most time. Entering additional amounts and data is easy. I like being able to accept one check from a vendor and move it among several Accounts Receivable.  Also, how nice to be able to invoice by email or snail mail!

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

Research this product before you buy it YouTube, Internet.  I recall seeing one YT video that said  his lasted only a couple of months.  Based on what I have read, it does speed up your trimming time.  However, it the product only lasts a few months, then I do not think it is worth the $60 dollars asking price...Plus there is no way to cut the excess line, except with a pair of cutting pliers or a knife.

108179,"This is a 1959 Western about a town, Warlock, Utah.  There is more than one movie named ""Warlock"".  This movie is a solid, if not great western.  The cast is excellent.  Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn, and Richard Widmark are all major stars.  DeForest Kelley plays the role of a cowboy before playing ""Bones"" in Star Trek.  Tom Drake, from Meet Me In St. Louis, to me, seems out of place as a brutal cowboy in this movie.  The movie is of high quality but was not a commercial success.

On the negative side, I feel this movie runs somewhat long.  The story could have ended sooner than it did.  There seems to be too many action climaxes.

On the positive side, I like this movie on several levels.  I like the cast.  I enjoy the cinematography.  I suppose most of all, to me, this movie seems to be a series of moral dilemmas and moral ambiguities.  Men are part saint and part sinner, much like life.  Thank You...",A Solid 1959 Western With A Great Cast

'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is the shining moment for this alltime screen legend.  He plays a man who faked insanity to go to a mental ward, only to find out it is just as bad as prison.  Along the way he find outs many of the patients are not that insane.  Many of them are in the ward voluntarily, but do not have the will to leave.  He rebels against the authorities and the result is a tragedy no one can stop from happening.  This is one of those rare films that everyone should see.

230696,"Great lock system.  My husband and I are remodeling our home and the search for locking systems seemed endless  who knew it would be some difficult to agree on a lock!?!?

Any way....we went back and forth between several different brands Schlage, Kwikset, Yale, Brinks, etc... and ultimately decided on the Kwikset.  Our decision was based on the style, durability we really put these things to the test at the store, ease of use was the handle comfortable, did the keys work easily, did duplicates work easily, etc, availability at stores/online and the parts for changing over interior and exterior doors, and finish type.  There are a lot of comparable lock sets out there, but this felt and acted much more heavy duty than the others we liked in this style.  It was between this set and a similar Schlage set.  This set won for 2 reasons  1 we liked the handles better, on the doors and the front door set and 2 the SmartKey system.  We have 4 exterior doors to our home, so we thought the SmartKey would be ideal.  System works great, easy to use handle, and the door closes snug every time.

Tips about this set  our first install was on a basement door.  We replaced an original wooden door with a new fiberglass door.  Love the entire set up and the new lock set looked great, but the handle was absolutely freezing to the touch.  We ended up taking the lock set off and cutting a piece of foam insulation to fit behind.  Problem solved!  It did not impact the usage of the lock or handle and cut down on the cold handle/cold air leaking through.",Quality lockset with great SmartKey feature

201884,"The ""todo"" list of a recent purchase of a used motor home included the need to update the entry lock. The original lock of the same design was broken because the potmetal plunger broke in a thin place and would not retract. Fortunately another item on the todo list was a defective window lock so we were able to gain access, remove the trim around the door, and with the aid of butter and spackling knives manually retracted the plunger. When the door opened the spring and plunger shot out of the lockset onto the ground. This is otherwise such a wellmade piece of hardware, I cannot understand why this crucial safety and security feature is so underengineered. The defective latch is cast white metal common pot metal where it should be forged steel to ensure strength and longevity. This is after all a motor vehicle door latch. Just look at the construction of the latches on your car or pickup. Other than this singular but major defect I find the lockset to be of high quality with very smooth action of the key and inside manual functions. I would gladly pay another few dollars for a completely wellmade lockset.",High quality lock made with poor quality materials.

We went with Zeal because her system seems to handle fish proteins best. We had no idea how much she was going to love it. She sits and waits as we make it, and wolfs down her food immediately after we put the bowl down. We have had her on literally dozens of foods, and she cannot get enough of this stuff.

Yes, this smells fishy  probably because it is real fish! It also cleans out of the bowls much more easily than any other food we have given her. Kind of creeps me out to wonder why the other foods stick to the bowl and this does not.

We only put 1/4 cup into her dry food 2x/day, because this stuff is obviously not cheap. But she eats so much better when this stuff is in her bowl that we make it work.",My dog can't get enough

196444,"This was a waste of $15.00.  When I initially inserted the batteries and tightened the cap, the pump did not even turn on.  I had to unscrew the cap slightly in order to get it to work.  Even then, it was intermittent.  I used it in my aquarium, which is one of the recommended applications.  In less than one minute it felt as if the tool was clogged, since the motor blades stopped spinning.  There were no instructions on how to unclog it, so I had to improvise.  I began by pulling the shaft away from the battery compartment which was a big mistake.  The motor is contained at the end of the shaft with cables leading down to it.  As soon as I pulled it apart, the cables broke off the motor.  This means that there is no way to clear a clog.  And if you are using this to transfer gasoline, I would be very hesitant to stick a cheaply made electric motor into a gasoline container.",It broke within minutes of use

83027,"This is a review of Under Armour Men's 9"" Armourvent Mesh.

Extremely comfortable with a waistband that is great. The transition from the actual waistband to the body of the underwear is so smooth and comfortable. It does not seem like it will soon loose it is stretch either. The body of the underwear is very lightweight yet provides subtle support around my thigh. Feels really great. The pouch provides enough space to keep things in check without being too restrictive.

My only complaint other than the outrageous price is that there are about 3 long tags attached to the inside back of the waistband. They can be carefully ripped out but you have to be careful otherwise you could pull one of the threads holding them on to the underwear and possibly have an unraveling of the stitching. I hate tags on the inside of my underwear.

I would never spend this much on a pair of underwear but if you are inclined to do so, these are certainly worthy of your attention.",Really comfortable and the waistband is great but the price is shockingly high

64146,"Robin Lee Hatcher departed from her usual book settings in THE HEART'S PURSUIT and it was not a mistake. She always creates a historic romance that takes you back in time when life was simpler if not harder and often dangerous.
Jared Newman is a bounty hunter who was set on this path searching for the man who murdered his family. Silver Matlock is the daughter of a local merchant left at the altar. How their lives intersect and the subsequent journey will hold you captive.
 I found the story compelling as it unfolds. What will be revealed next, where will the journey go and what will be the outcome?
Ms. Hatcher is a skilled author who writes hearttouching books covering various historical periods. I have never been dissatisfied or disappointed when reading her books. I enjoyed The Heart's Pursuit and found it hard to put down until I finished.
I received this book free for an honest and fair review from Zondervan and Thomas Nelson Publishers.",GREAT HISTORICAL NOVEL

63804,"In BLUE RIDGE, T.R. Pearson follows two storylines with the slimmest of connections; his two protagonists are cousins.  The far better of the two tales is that of Ray Tatum, a former city cop who is now a deputy sheriff in Hogarth, Virginia. Trying to put a family tragedy and failed marriage behind him, Ray discovers a body along the Appalachian Trail and with the assistance of a rather fierce Park Ranger from DC; he pursues the trail which leads to one of those places that are very difficult to deal with in a small town. This part of the story feels very authentic to me, the story stretches just far enough to hold your interest and the relationship between Ray and the ranger, Kit just feels very real. The dialogue and settings work exceptionally well.

It is the tale of Ray's cousin, Paul, and his trip to NYC that reads like a bad pulp story. Paul is called in to identify the body of the son he never actually had anything to do with after his original conception. From there Paul becomes involved with a dopey duo of cops, a conniving actress, and a criminal who almost seems omniscient in his portrayal by Pearson. Wasting time with a trip through the seamy side of Manhattan and finishing up with an outrageously ridiculous ending, I could not help but wish Pearson had focused all his energies on Ray's tale and left Paul in his notebook; Pearson's dialogue and settings seem to ring much truer in the South.","Two tales of crime, one much better than the other"

193245,"So far it works well and it is cool that it sharpens different sizes and shapes. It is also cool that it stops when sharp. The issue is that it is really hard to get the pencil in and out. Our kids have a hard time using it by themselves. In a classroom situation, I would hate to have a pencil sharpener that kids could not just use!

It seems to sharpen well and be powerful, it just takes a good amount of force to get the pencil in. I would also think that with as hard as it is to get pencils in that that would mean that the pencil would be centered well. Unfortunately, you can tell that pencils are not centered well because the wood is nearer to the point that it should be on one side.

The off center and the hard to get the pencils in both make this hard to recommend. I want to like it. I mean it does seem to work and sharpen quickly. I just do not know that I can really suggest it. If it were not so expensive it would be easier to recommend.",Sharpens quickly and consistently. But part of that consistent is off-center.

205632,"Added ""CeraTec"" into my last oil change, everything went well, be sure to shake the can rigorously! It comes out initially a creamy orange color, like spicy mayonnaise. I added the CeraTec to new oil before pouring into the engine, I then shook the oil and ceratec mixture again to ensure complete saturation. I noticed the engine was much quieter and smoother than before after running it for a few hundred miles.Audi A3 w/ 2.0 Turbo FSI. Although after 2000 miles the engine is nearly as noisy as it was before, but still very very smooth. I have not noticed any change in MPGs though.

When adding this to an oil change make sure to compensate and not add to much oil solution to your engine, you can damage your engine by adding to much fluid overall. My engine takes 5 quarts, so adding this container is nearly 1 additional quart to the 5 quarts of oil makes for nearly 6 quarts, I simply poured out 1 quart of oil into an empty oil bottle to add into the engine at a later time 2.0 FSI engines are notorious for drinking oil.

I cannot be sure this stuff really does anything without some sort of scientific testing? The engine runs smooth though it always was, but is not much quieter, and MPGs have not changed at all. I really cannot tell any difference, but hopefully this will add to the engines longevity. The product is not expensive, so it cannot hurt to give it a shot really.

64451,"I found David Vann`s ""Caribou Island"" phenomenal. It is certainly not an easy, or even a pleasant read. It is not for those who need actionpacked thrillers. It is rather a read for those who enjoy relentlessly building tension.  The characters are certainly less than perfect, but they are not less human for that. Readers looking for easytotell heros and badguys will be disappointed. Readers who admire sparse yet beautifully rendered prose will enjoy ""Caribou Island"", as will those who enjoy careful depictions of landscape and setting. But most of all, to enjoy ""Caribou Island"" requires a willingness to tackle the very toughest themes about family: the gradual estrangement between parents and children; the trauma of a parent`s death ""Caribou`s..."" must one of the most exquisitely devastating first paragraphs ever written; the collapse of marriage and the foretold disaster of an upcoming marriage.

Reading the conclusion to Cameron and Jaci's story definitely contained a twist I was not prepared for, but I was riveted at how it all came together.

Cam and Jaci finally reveal the true extent of their feelings for each other and, in a twist of fate, his secrets are revealed to Jaci, causing her to understand just how much he had to suffer at the hands of his aunt and her friends as a teenager. She feels his sorrow and pain deep down and hurts for him, wanting nothing but to ""make all the bad things go away.""

Throughout the series, we have known that Jaci was struggling to deal with Richard and Annalee Roberts and the reputation of hers that they tried to keep tarnished. In the final installment, Jaci and her friend Moriah have been conspiring to catch them admitting to what they did, but when the meeting is set up at Moriah's, Jaci walks into the most unexpected situation.

There is so much more that could be said about the story, but I do not like to include spoilers. I was glad that Cam and Jaci were able to get past their secrets and progress in their relationship","wanting nothing but to ""make all the bad things go away"

127553,"Great little plug for one use. This is a one trick pony. The tone has little effect and the gain is basically another volume. This does not behave like a tube amp, contrary to some reviews. It sounds pretty much the same whether I am using the bridge or humbucker on my Les Paul and similar to all pickups on my HSS strat. The bottom line is it is not responsive, AT ALL. However, the upside is that is gives a nice classic distortion sound and is absolutely perfect for sitting around practicing. I use a set of earplugs and just put one plug in my ear while sitting on the couch watching tv and practicing. I have a tube amp and a couple of modeling amps that I use when I want to turn up the volume but this little amplug gets used more often. If you want a way to keep it down, and only a set of headphones to plug in, this thing is perfect.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that let us you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25 less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",Worked like a charm

They are welldesigned, wellengineered, and built to last. I have never had a problem with any of them.

While the device runs on a very inexpensive and easilyavailable CR2032 lithium flat cell battery they sell for about $6 for a pack of 20, and while it is quite easy to open the unit and replace the battery, the reality is that the batteries almost never need replacing. In my experience, even in heavy usage, that is, settings where the fence alert goes off quite frequently, one battery lasts at least 3 to 4 years, and in settings where the fence alert that is, the flashing light is rarely triggered, a battery lasts well over 7 years.","I love them.

First time trying this right out of the package only the oil side would come out
It took quite a bit of work to get the white cream side to pump out.
Then now that I am able to get the full product to dispense as intended I think it needs work on the pump system.
It says to use two pumps daily. I am finding that the spout part I guess you would call it is not far enough away from the base and so much slides down the side that I find myself trying to scrape it up.
If i try to pump at an angle into my hand to combat that problem then the lotion side barely comes out.

Now aside from the issue of the pump itself the product results I am pleased with so far.
The scent for me being with with allergies is just on the edge of being too strong  but I am learning to deal with it.
Thankfully for me it does not linger too long.
After about ten days now I am noticing the skin on my face seems to look brighter and certainly more hydrated.

We applied two coats to all of our placemats and coasters, allowing a full day drying in between reapplication and use. We have been using them on our wood table for a week now and they do not slide and there is no residue whatsoever on the table.

This is essential reading for anyone hoping to survive a natural or manmade disaster of Biblical proportions i.e. Hurricane Katrina comes to mind, and perhaps, the next flu pandemic.  Work, cooking, exercise keep getting in the way of reading this book.  This is an oral history of a future world war between humans and zombies.  The undead are infectious!  Its like some form of viral rabies pandemic.  The zombie pandemic can be traced back to ""Patient Zero"", a child whose father may or may not have been bitten and disappeared during a dive into the submerged ruins of the Three Gorges Dam in China. Each chapter corresponds to a time frame pertaining to before, during and after the pandemicreferred to as World War Z because the only viable response to the pandemic was to ""eliminate"" the infected i.e. the zombies.  This is not the first pandemic zombie work to come out this year.  So far so goodand a vastly superior work relative to Stephen King's zombie story Cell: A Novel although King's novel may have some more interesting literary goodies like allusions to genocide and evolution I have yet to mull over.",Vastly Superior to King's Cell: A Novel

174641,"These felt good the first time I put them on, and I have been using them as my everyotherday elliptical workout shoe for about seven months. No signs of wear at this point, which is mildly surprising given their lightweight construction. Excellent fit too, without a lot of foam to cover up for shoddy design.

I want to highlight the one way in which they are superior to almost all the other athletic shoes I have had in the last ten years  they never come untied. They have flat laces that feel like mostly cotton, instead of the oval, nylon laces that come with most shoes. I simply never have to stop and tie them, and that alone is worth an extra ten bucks a pair in my book. Why do not more athletic shoe manufacturers get this?

I am not crazy about the flashy, reflective cosmetics. However, I know running shoes often have that to make them stand out when people are running at night. So there is a good reason for the bright colors in the trim, and I will not downgrade them for it.","Lightweight, comfortable for aerobics, and they STAY TIED!"

When I put the lotion on it went on smooth and when it dried, it did not leave a greasy residue at all. It is winter in the Midwest and my skin can get really dry but after using it for a few days, I can feel the difference. My skin is already looking and feeling much better.

171843,"In her introduction D.G. Kaye says ""I wrote this book to share the negative experiences and obstacles I have encountered in my own life. I have tracked my own insecurities and the selfesteem issues of my past in an effort to recognize and conquer the negative image I had of my youth...all so I could finally learn to love myself.""
Anyone who has read her previous books knows that you can count on D.G. Kaye to be open and candid and in her own words, ""baring my raw self to the world."" Her honesty and transparency makes for a book that allows the reader to relate with the yearnings in all of our hearts and souls to be our true selves.
This is a book that ought to be on parents' and educators' to read and reread list: ""...words linger much longer than physical wounds. The damage done to our delicate egos, especially when we are small, stays with us through the rest of our lives.""
What is comforting is that D.G. offers sound advice on how to repair our damaged egos and take care of our sense of self. She provides concrete examples of her own life and how she conquered her fears. ""If we do not take responsibly for our own choices, we can become ruled by someone else's power. This results in us giving up pieces of our own identities to satisfy the whims of someone else, leaving us with little selfesteem...Everyone has something beautiful to offer.""
This time around, D.G.Kaye has this beautiful book to offer.

90866,"I have always been a Harris Bipod guy. I have three, as a matter of a fact. But wanting another bipod, and Harris bipods costing north of a hundred bucks lately, I thought I would check around to see what else was out there. UTG is a good value, but was lacking the swivel feature. So I thought I would give Tiptop a try. Got it today, and I must say I am impressed. It has very robust construction. And a couple of features that I thought were nice additions. The swivel is lockable and comes with the ratchet handle, whereas I was paying extra to get a piece to add to a Harris. The knobs that tighten the legs are larger. And the screw that tightens the unit to the swivel stud has a hex drive, so you can go beyond finger tight if you desire. Take it from a bipod snob, the Tiptop product will impress you too. It compares very favorably to the Harris.",Harris Who?
10565,"My wife tried this: The CLENZIderm line from Obagi is specifically geared for acneprone skin.  My skin has gotten better as I Have grown older, but occasionally I need a little extra help.  This product is THE product for those who break out, but because of the benzoyl peroxide, it can feel fairly harsh on the skin; you know, like its on fire. While it can be quite uncomfortable, it does its job, and that is what counts!  Can be a saving grace for those who experience frequent breakouts! PS  it got 4 stars because of the burning feeling though par for the course with benzoyl peroxide and the cost kaching.","Great for acne-prone skin, but its potent"

191524,"Overall, this is an excellent pencil sharpener and setup is as easy as unpacking it from the box and plugging it in: no tape, extra packaging, etc., to take off and wonder if you got it all.

Sharpening is very fast  just put in the pencil, apply a little pressure, and out pops a supersharp pencil without shavings hanging around the end that will smudge your work.

One of the better features of this sharpener is the desktop footprint: it sharpens in the portrait or up and down method vs. horizontal method, which means the hardware and waste tray spend more room going up instead of taking up more desk space.  While that means less of a waste tray in terms of trash / shavings volume it can hold, to me the space issue is key with everything else that is on my desk.  Emptying the waste tray is easy, and does not leave residue on your desk as others can.

This one is a few dollars more than the traditional electric sharpener from Boston or Atco that take up more room on your desk.  If space is important to you, I would recommend this one.",Excellent Pencil Sharpener and Saves Room on Your Desk

2288,"I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in both cats and dogs. They love this stuff!

They have not gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it is easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill does not have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he will gobble it right down.

Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot  one of my dogs will not eat anymore unless he is got the chicken crumbles on his food.

169309,"This was a cute fast read almost a novella that I really enjoyed.  I was able to read it in one sitting and since I had read all the other ""Justice"" books, I enjoyed getting back to this series.  If you have not read any of the other books, this is still a good standalone. The story is about 2 undercover agents who used to work for the FBI but now work for the Justice Company.  They are partners who are in love but have no real urge to marry. Caroline's mother is trying to push the couple to have a wedding.  As undercover agents they are sent to Las Vegas to find the missing daughter of a Senator.  And of course, all sorts of action ensue!

""Some Are Born"", ""Everybody Loves You"", ""Days"" and the title tracks are the strongest tracks here, and there are only 2 clunkers ; the awkward ""Heart Of The Matter"" and the tedious ""Nostalgia Do not Forget"".

I do not normally review CDs that are out of print, but this collection was really special, as was this group in the short time it was firing on all cylinders.

First, you need a good headset.  It does not necessarily need to be an expensive one, but a good one. I like Plantronics, myself.  This does NOT work well with a builtin microphone.

Second, you need to speak CLEARLY.  If you mumble a lot. .. . if you say um a lot. . . . if you have a thick accent. . . . its going to be much more challenging to use this software.

Third, you have to give it time.  Yes, it works outofthebox, but it takes a bit of time for it to learn your voice.  If you throwin the towel, after only using it for a day, then you are really not giving it a chance.

I Have used Dragon for Window with success.  This is the first time I Have tried the Mac version.  I know that some have had issues with past versions, but so far, I like this one just fine.  I still like the Windows version better, but that is really more of a personal preference.

It still turned on, the fan still blew but my computer would not recognize it. I am only slightly tech savvy but I knew that the drive was not irreparably damaged. Just not cooperating with me. I live in the boonies of Arkansas so I decided to send it into a data recovery facility for an evaluation. They told me it would cost several hundreds of dollars to recover the data and put it on a new hard drive. Knowing this was unlikely I asked to have it sent back. After much arguing. They finally did. I ordered this cable set so I could do some evaluating of my own. Took my external hard drive out of the case, plugged it up, and lo and behold my computer recognizes the drive no problem. Inferring it was the case that was the issue PCB. So instead of being scammed out of several hundreds of dollars, I saved tons by buying this and recovering the data myself.

213554,"autocad LT 2010 is a good substitute for professionals who need 2D drafting tools, but who do not want to pay for the full version of Autocad. This is NOT the tool for someone looking to make basic drawings of their home, business or DIY projects.

I work for is a steel stocking and manufacturing company. We receive drawings from customers in Autocad format every day. All of our work is 2D, and Autocad is an essential tool in our portfolio of applications. The full version of Autocad is several hundred dollars more than this `Lite' version. That being said, make sure you compare the features of the Lite vs full versions at [...] so that you do not end up missing a feature that you need.

This is NOT the program for an average person looking to do casual drawings, floor plans, flow charts, etc. If you are an average user, the best program to use for you is likely to be Microsoft Visio. While it cannot do many of the technical things that Autocad can do, it can allow you to make floor plans, simple part drawings, etc.

Comparing v10 to previous versions:

You are going to either love or hate the ribbon. I like it. So do the people in my drafting department, including people who have been using Autocad for 10 years.

The alignment functionality saves a lot of time. Worth the price of the upgrade by itself.

Layer management has been improved. Also worth the price of the upgrade.

If you are in need of training, or a refresher, I highly recommend the DVDbased training available through CADD Train  [...]","A good substitute for professionals who need 2D drafting tools, but who don't want to pay for the full version of Autocad."

I also saw the most of the folks felt the Mitutoyo was top of the line, but may not be worth the additional cost  $95 vs $40. I purchased the iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 06"" Digital calipers but I am returning them because of the display, which I have not seen discussed on this forum. I also purchased the Mitutoyo calipers. When comparing the display on the iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 06"" Digital vs the Mitutoyo you very quickly see the reason for the price difference. I expected to find a quality difference between the two, but was blown away by the clarity, size and quality of the display on the Mitutoyo. 50019630 I cannot fault the iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 06"" Digital as it appeared to be accurate and pretty well made, but for a tool that I plan to use for many years, I decided the price difference was worth paying. Bottom line, you will not be disappointed in the accuracy of the iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 06"" Digital, but if you can afford the Mitutoyo calipers, go for it.
For those that are concerned about fake Mitutoyo calipers, the one I ordered came from Amazon LLC, and the calipers came in a sealed package that had to be cut open. Not the box mind you, but the actual packing that contained the calipers. All the included paperwork, box battery etc. said made in Japan. I do not think for a second that the calipers I received were not genuine.","iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 0-6"" Digital vs Mitutoyo"

151079,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I have not had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I am only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I do not understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I am sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I do not think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I do not know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight

It arrived in descent time.. But was hard to build. By that I mean the wood splinters and is very thin and cheap. I screwed in one panel only to have it split easy right down the middle. So I had to fix that because I am not carrying what is close to 60 pounds into a NYC post office to return. The wood smells nice but it is dry and brittle. So the screws power drill worked better crack the wood as they go in. I put down two doggie wee wee training pads inside so it does not hurt the baby with splitters. If you drop this after its assembled it can break very very easy. It is similar to the boarding used in cheap ikea furniture.

45770,"I bought this version as a reference to compare with my Mauersberger recording. Butt is a very articulate, subtle, discerning and knowledgeable musicologist. ANd experienced performer. The Mauersberger recording is as good as Karl Richter's, which many people think is the gold standard for The St. Matthews Passion. How does Butt's version stand up to these giants? The text translation is better. The sound values benefit from contemporary technology. The counterpoint/ harmony and musical lines are clear and well articulated. The performance is stripped down to its essentials, with the 8 voices doubling as necessary. And the orchestra is as Bach would have had at his disposal. Rather than the great ""Romantic"" orchestras and choral forces used in the last century. Butt's Consort and singers are not super stars, and this showed at times. But, overall this is a very competent, and even, at times, exciting, performance. Clean, clear and very accessible for someone coming to St. Matthew with an open mind. I would recommend it.",Competent and well informed performance.

I am not actually a big fan of historical novels since I find them very hard to read, but I must say that this book changed my mind on that stance. I felt that I was transported back in time to this actual time period. The book did an excellent job of recreating this era. I thought that this story was very realistic and fantastic at the same time. I was so enthralled with this story that I had to keep reading it until the very end. You really get a sense of what plantation life was like back then, and what it took to survive. You learn what heros her ancestors were and all of the things that they had to do to keep this mansion thriving. There is a lot more to this story than what I am telling you know. I am not saying much because I believe that it is worth the read. If you like this genre of book you will not be disappointed by this story. It is well worth the read.

226361,"I wanted a carryorganizer to replace an upright drawer type organizer that had quite a few compartments for storage of 410 bolts, screws, washers, etc.  This is one of a couple I have found that might do that adequately  is well made.  I often need the parts on a job  carrying a drawer type is a disaster.  Although the lid is not as stiff as I would like it to be, it seems like it will maintain small parts in their intended compartment.  It is about the right depth to hold enough parts in a compartment but not so deep as to bury the bottom parts if you are storing slightly different size parts.  The latches seem robust  audibly snap when they are closed.  The compartments are removable  they can be somewhat reconfigured in the organizer.
It seems like a large container but it does allow the parts to be stored more openly so you can see what you have.  The yellow color helps with visibility inside the compartments, especially for small parts, as opposed to some organizers that have black interiors.
Although I do not recommend it, it seems robust enough to not break if stepped on.  However, it may not survive a driveover.

That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

56549,"DO NOT BUY!
I bought this from a highly reputable electronics online seller and left a raving initial review on the website, unfortunately since the online store no longer sells this model I cannot edit my review to give the following information
CONS:
I did an update and it KILLED my player and since its over a year old Samsung offered no support to resolve it at their cost.
Netflix and Amazon continually froze and locked up the player updates never fixed this issue nor did remote tech support
Player would constantly loose wifi connection not a problem with my network
Brightness was dark compared to other devices I connected
Phone/Online Support tried to blame me for issues

I wanted to like this bluray player, it was feature packed and at a good price but ultimately it was a $100 piece of junk. If I had not done the update I still might have a player that could at least play discs.

I will never buy another Samsung product and at least I found out what the company's made of including their support with a minimal $100 purchase instead of more.",SAMSUNG BROKE IT (Routine update) SAMSUNG WON'T FIX IT.

The xbox has great games and the best graphics over all of the consoles.  Gamecube was my second favorite, mostly because of the quality gameplay nintendo puts into there games, but in general the graphics were much less vibrant than the xbox which bothered me after playing the games for long periods. I sold my gamecube and PS2 because I kept coming back to the xbox.  Just buy it and enjoy.  I would also recommend Halo 2 coming out this November.

160081,"I have been a Far Cry fan since FC2. Never saw the original. FC3 was excellent. In FC4, the game seems a little disjointed. The side missions and battles in Shangri La just do not seems to flow with the main story line. Very disconnected. The vehicle controls have changed and I find them a little awkward even after hours of playing. And, typical of the Far Cry series, you are never really short of funds as there are plenty of chests to loot, cash laying about, bodies to loot  even though your weapons are free once you liberate the necessary radio towers or perform the required sidemissions. I would actually like to have to be a little more concerned about finding enough coin. Make things a little more difficult to come by, like having to take out more enemies just so you can scrounge together the money for ammo or syringes. Speaking of syringes  I still have not figured out how to craft them in this game. Unlike FC3, it is not that obvious how it is done. I have not really needed them to tell the truth.
There are many features I do like. The crossbow, the buzzer, the animals, the main storyline, etc.
It is still a great game, just not an excellent game.",A little disappointed...

218895,"Anyone with a green thumb will tell you that there is no such thing as a watering schedule that is based on the need of the plant.  Varying soils, temperature, humidity, sunlight, and of course the size and variety of the plant are all factors that determine how often a plant needs water.  So the question is, do you have the understanding of perception and the instinct to know when your plants need water.  I do, but my wife does not.  As a result, we have lost several plants to overwatering.  Hopefully this helps the situation.

This unit is extremely accurate.  I borrowed a professional one from a neighbor of mine to test against this unit and this one is amazingly close.  No plants except maybe some orchids need a closer definition of the exact water conditions.

Be sure to stick the tip well down into the plant however, as it will only measure as deep as you go.  If you only put the tip down one inch, it will only tell you what is at that level.  The top of the soil NEVER needs to be wet.  It is the roots that drink the water, and good quality soil will wick any water that is lower up to those roots.  This unit has a nice long probe on it, so use it to your advantage to get the most accurate reading possible, then make mental notes of it to associate what you see and feel to the actual readings.  This can actually help develop your natural intuition with regard to what plants need because you associate the reading with your observations.

I received a free sample unit for my evaluation and honest review.  I have no association with the company.",Verified extremely accurate

Recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products. Do the new stickon manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention?

Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5minute section with holistichealth advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be?

Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin.

The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I am at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious lifechanging situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations.

41414,"This is really one of the best rap albums to come out in the 90s. Yes, there are some bad songs and some of the intros are really annoying. For example the one intro when Biggie is banging some girl is really unneeded. All in all the intros are the weakest part of the album and by far the easiest parts to skip over. But enough about the bad when there is so many good things to say about this masterpiece. Things Done Changed is a cool back in the day song and is indeed enjoyable, then comes the very catchy Give Me the Loot. Although the subject matter of that song is laughable the chorus is very catchy. More highlights are the spectacular Ready to Die, the classic Juicy great hip hop bass line, and the dance party favorite Big Poppa.
However the greatness of this album is all about the producing. I saw Biggie live and he did not sound the same, he sounded more flat and not as impressive as he does through a stereo. Every song is recorded prefectly. Big Poppa for example has each part in perfect balance. I can hear Biggie rapping and every little nuance in the background music. For some reason rappers today cannot get that down and they spew their inarticulate lyrics at lightning speed and everything turns into a blur, but every single one of Biggie's songs is produced perfectly. Puff Daddy really knew what was up for this aentire album.
Also the entire album embodies the American myth of rags to riches and then an early death. Sonehow all of his lyrics are prophetic of what would happen to him and they all create the narrative of an amazing life of an amazing rapper.

Musically, her haunting voice can be undermined by an incredibly disinterested demeanor when she sings see her recent ""Saturday Night Live"" performance for a good example.  Yet, he has an undeniable presence and new era style to her music.

  ""Summertime Sadness"" is the type of song that will take Lana from being a novelty singer, appealing only to a niche audience, to becoming a larger mainstream presence on this charts.

It was in perfect playedonce condition, which shows how much its owner dug it.

I like Nancy Wilson a lot but her one tune here does nothing for me, pure MOR schmaltz, like the rest of the album. Even the one funkish tune, Sweet Dreams, is nowhere near what the Crusaders were able to do on earlier records, despite a Larry Carlton solo far from his best. Everything is overproduced, polished to a fault, and lacking any soul or grit that I can discern.

Easily the weakest Crusaders album I have ever heard, of about ten.

With so many unheard albums out there, I doubt I will ever hear this again, and someone will get a used record played all of twice. Hope they do not pay more than 25 cents.","Slick, overpolished smooth nothingness"

159138,"The PS2 is one of the best systems around. I have owned game systems starting from the Atari 2600 all the way up to the PS2 and I would have to say the PS2 offers the biggest bang for the buck. First off, you have a HUGH selection of PS1 games. Then add to that an almost equally hugh selection of PS2 games and you have got a nearly endless array of games covering just about all genres. Many of these games can be found cheap on the used market.

This particular model is the SingStar Ceramic White PS2. It comes with two microphones and the Singstar gamealong with 1 controller. I own the Silver PS2 already and have really enjoyed it the last 3 plus years. I decided to add another PS2 to my collection as a backup. I liked the look of this model so that is why I chose it.

Lastly for those into retrogaming, the PS2 has some of the best compilations from companies such as SNK, Taito, Sega, Activision, Capcom, and Atari. Interestingly, a collection from Konami for one of the newest systems only has 3 games. Most of the compilations for the PS2 has at least 20 gamessome a lot more  for a modest price too.

170126,"Of all the true DD books I have read, I liked this one the most. In many of these stories the woman always seems to be portrayed as person who I just cannot connect with on any level. But Reggie she seems more real. In some stories the women are just described as not being aware of themselves or whatever. That is not the case here. Now, maybe Reggie does not take good care of her health she is sick and not in bed but she is not all flighty or 'oh I just forgot to eat' nonsense'.

  Alex is a straight up guy but he is not a jerk. He does not come across as some bully to me. He comes across as truly caring about her and not just wanting to discipline her. It comes across as a romance novel..not a spanking story.

The only negative thing I can say about story is that it is too short, but I have noticed that about DD stories. I assume it is just part of the genre. I do wish more time was spent on character development. I think it would make the stories that much better.",interesting

Ultimately, I think that this recording is absolutely brilliant.  In contrast to some critics, I think that the musical variety contained within this show is stunning, yet I felt like Schwartz was up to the challenge throughout the show, regardless of the style which he was using for a given song.  Take note of ""In Pursuit of Excellence"" as a perfect example of a totally unique, but absolutely engaging song.

For whatever it is worth, I have some serious theological issues with this show.  I would not actually recommend anyone to casually watch the show because I think that there are some unfortunate misrepresentations of the character of God.  However, there are also some powerful moments of personalizing the story of the human experience within God's creation that become real in ways that only theatre can provide.  And it offered hours of good conversation for my wife and me afterwards.

Specifically related to this album, I love it.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the musical theatre format but who wants some more depth than many Broadway shows.",As good as any musical recording...

 My cats have had it a few days and they are still very interested in it. The base is quite light so they can tip it over during play. You can simply tip it back up to get it going again. My cats have actually ""learned"" to play in such a way as to NOT knock it over.

The toy makes a slight whirling noise  not annoying and barely audible  The fluttering action is very life like. Our toy has been in heavy play but it is still works great. The butterfly is made of thin plastic. My cats have bent and bitten little holes in the butterfly but it is still attached to the toy.

The toy takes one AAA battery. It goes through them pretty quickly. I purchased a whole pack at the dollar store.

I recommend turning the toy off and storing it in its box  when onto in use I have to put mine on a shelf in a closet My cats will not leave it alone if I leave it out.

It is a fun game and some of the scenarious are quite challenging.  Ubisoft has just released an update to the game whereby you can reset all the outposts allowing you to conquer them again but only once the main quest has been completed.

First, there are no Easy Clean hinges. The seat is stamped Easy Clean too. This one has fixed hinges so you cannot remove it to clean underneath. I should have stopped and returned it at this point, but thought I could live without the removable feature. The STATITE does not really stay tight. When you install the seat, the posts will snap off underneath when the appropriate tightness is achieved. You would think that this means the seat is as tight as the manufacturer intended. However, I found out a week later that if you shift your weight on the seat, it moves.

While I used to think meal is a cheaply made food, I did some research and found it really is not. The quality of the meal depends on the supplier of the food. If chicken meal is used, the whole chicken minus bones is ground up, turned into meal and driedand this renders a higher concentrate of protein than if just chicken meat is used. It appears to me that the Nutro food is highly nutritious and made with quality ingredients and made in the US. My dogs, all three, really seem to like this food. While I did have a lot of reservations in the past, I think the 'meals' in foods are goodit just depends on whether or not the suppliers are using high quality ingredientssuch as chickens that are not too fat, or the meant is not spoiled, etc.

212966,"There is a known bug with the latest version  once installed, the PC can take  LITERALLY  hours to boot.  I have a Gateway that is 4 months old.  Worked fine until I installed the new version of this program.  Now it takes 194 minutes  give or take 10 minutes  for the computer to power on.  What is worse, whatever their new drivers are doing disables the keyboard until windows starts.  That means I cannot do a ""last known good"" start or a safe mode start. I am DOA.  Roxio has no fix, except to state that booting into safe mode can help it would be nice if I could! or to disconnect the CD drives each time the PC is booted right  like I am going to open the PC, yank the cables, start the PC, and reattach the cables each time I power cycle?A?
It is a great product  but it is basically trashed my PC.  What really ticks me off is that Roxio KNEW about this but but gave no warning.  So beware  if you install this product, you may learn the true meaning of ""multitasking""  you can go and get multiple tasks done while your PC boots.","Works fine, but  wreaks havoc with the PC at restart"

65610,"This book deals with the Arian controversy of the 4th century, and how Christianity was accepted and eventually made the state religion of the Roman empire.
It is a story of how the Christians went from being the oppressed to being the oppresors, and the formation of Christian theology that has dominated the religion for seventeen centuries.  The two opposing views of Christ held by the followers of Arius and the followers of Athanasius led to bickering and bloodshed, all in the name of Christ, the prince of peace.
Perhaps this book can she would some light on why after seventeen centuries, bloodshed and violence continue to be a part of Christianity.  It is a story of power, control and politics from the 4th century that appears to be ongoing today.

There are a lot of business terminology that confused me and took time to learn what it all means.

I was able to plan out a simple trip, which included cost and gave me an array to choose from of what to do during the trip, but as mentioned, it took several hours of program use just to figure out what I was doing.  Bottom Line is this is definitely for business use.",Good program but with a steep learning curve.

The only she might miss is the variety of automatic buttonholes available on a more expensive sewing machine; however, I was nearly 40 before owning a machine with an automatic buttonhole feature. The Brother XL26001 has 1. I am just down the street; and my Singer has 7 buttonholes that she can use as her interest expands come to think of it...inherit.

158845,"Let me make one thing really clear if I have not all ready:  THIS GAME, AS WITH ALL THE OTHER RESIDENT EVIL GAMES, WILL SCARE YOU OUT OF YOUR SKIN. THERE ARE PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND WITH CHAINSAWS THAT CUT UP INDIVIDUALS, THERE ARE ZOMBIES THAT SUCK PEOPLE'S BLOOD OUT, THERE ARE DOGS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY ARE INFECTED WITH A CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT JUMP OUT AND RIPS YOUR HEAD OFF AND YOU ACTUALLY WATCH IT BEING DONE AND LET ME TELL YA, IT IS SICKENING!!! WHEN YOU SHOOT A ZOMBIE, THEY DO NOT DISAPEAR. THEY JUST STAY THERE SO YOU CAN KEEP ON SHOOTING THEIR GUTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND YOU DO DO THAT AND IT IS A GROSS THING TO DO AND SEE AFTER IT IS DONE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS AND ALL THE RESIDENT EVIL GAMES THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR THE GAMECUBE, WHICH ARE NOT TO BE ON THE KIDDIE SYSTEM.

15281,"This Zwilling J.A. Henckels 5Piece Grooming Set comes packaged in a nice heavy black box with minimal markings on the outside. The inside of the box looks remarkably like the cover of a romance novel, perhaps one with vampires. That was unusual, and surprising. I guess it adds some interest, but I think the packaging would be classier looking without it.

Inside the box you will find first a lightweight pouch with a flap protecting a very nice looking leather zipper case. These are described as tools for men, but I am not sure why. Each and every one of the five tools inside can be used by women as well. The tools are nice looking and a most of them are a good weight. The nail clippers are different from any that I have seen before, and frankly they seem to be not only the tool most often used, but they do not seem to be sturdy enough to last long. I may be wrong, but they are lightweight and fold flat. That is a nice feature, but it is also what makes me a bit leery about their long term use. They are also rather small for a man's hand in my opinion.

All in all, I think this is a nice set. It would make a nice gift for anyone who travels, or who likes to have nice looking grooming tools. Perhaps I am missing something, but aside from the case, I do not feel that these are much different from grooming tools that you can purchase almost anywhere. I am certain of one thing, you will be paying mostly for branding here.",Useful and travel ready

6076,"this is a really good clipper.  I was  going to buy the Safari clipper on amazon but thought it was a tad pricey.  So when i went to my local pet store pet supermarket to be exact, i saw this for a little over $8 and bought it.

Very good quality.  this is by four paws a company that sells miscellanous pet stuffs.  Best thing is that this has a 3 year gurantee on the blade.  awesome!!!  when i tried it on my cat who is not a huge fan of getting her nails clip, this clipper clipped precisely nice and clean cut! without ruining her nails or smashing them.  When i say 'smash' nails, i mean that when you clip them, the affect part gets pressed so hard it turns white and breaks the integrity of the nail as if it was 'smashed' or forcefully pounded upon. I have bought a subpar brand in walmart for about $5 and it was horrible....i clip very little of her nail tip as i always do but her nails were splitting up or/and smashed.

perfect size for cats.  i think item can be better ergonomically made....but overall very pleased with this product.  there is another four paws clipper for both dogs and cats but it is so big i preferred to get this one.",very good quality and cat-perfect

PROS :
The Playroon games are fun to play and interact with.
The bots are adaptive to how the controller is set and your playability is.
Picture quality is decent, not excellent like one would expect.
The mic is a fairly cool add on, and it is nice to be able to move the camera up and down, for the few games it is compatible with.

CONS :
Not many games out there that are compatible with the camera.
Picture quality may be an issue for some, but I do not mind it that much, could have been worse.
Nothing for Skype users, or for those who use the messaging on the PS4, which I hope changes soon, since I do use the messaging quite a bit with friends",Love it

86854,"I ws looking for an underhelmet thermal cap with a windresistant front panel, and overear protection. This fit the bill. Made from a tightly knit thermal microfiber, I washed this the first evening I received it and it was completely dry by the next morning. Wicking is an important feature for me as I perspire from my head when exercising. The cap is thin enough to fit comfortably under my helmet and provide a smooth and comfortable cushion layer without any pressure points. I wear a large hat size and this cap fits my head perfectly and does not feel overstretched or excessively tight. There is a thicker inner liner that wraps around the front panel back to the ears to block the wind. The rest of the cap is made of a single layer of thermal microfiber. The only shortcoming I found with this cap was that the first language on the labeling was Chinese, and there were no washing or fabric care instructions included. This should not be a problem if you handle this cap like the rest of your microfiber active wear. Tomorrow will be a chilly day, highs in mid 50's and overcast, so I will be giving this cap it is first field test. Unless I post an update, you can assume that it performed well.",Great Thermal Cap for a Good Price.

138520,"If you want your scope to look nice around your neck, this one will do it for you.  Let me say that it does work, I can do BP and hear heart and lung sounds with this scope.  With that said its just not put together with the tolerances needed to acheive an air seal at the head.  The stem fits loosely in the head.  When you turn it to ""click"" for either the small bell or the diaphram side, it feels sloppy.  If you take the tubing off of the head and blow into the stem, air leaks out around the stem regardless of where you have the stem turned, pushed, or pulled.

I would love to know how to disassemble the stem, and possibly add some orings or silicone to the stem to attempt to get an airtight seal, but as it is, it will never be as sensitive as it could be.

If you were willing to give up the bell, you could probably epoxy the stem in place, and seal up the bell hole to get a sensitive, working diaphram side, but really, it should just work out of the box.",Disappointed with construction

In despeation, I called their 900 number and up front I told the rep I would not pay as Norton caused the problem. He went along with that. It turned out Norton AntiVirus is incompatible with another Norton product, and that caused the crash.

When my phone bill came I was shocked to see I was charged $132 for the privilege of having my computer crashed. After numberous calls, I was told by Norton customer ""service"" in a foreign country that it was impossible for them to refund my money.

227259,"We originally bought the Renaissance wax on the recommendation of others who have used it in the past to protect their art. Once we saw the history of the wax and the fact that it is museum quality, we decided to try it. Hubby has used minwax paste wax on furniture before. However, when the wife used this on her new chair, he was amazed at the ease of application and the shine it leaves. A little of this wax goes a long way. It dries quickly, and easily buffs to an amazing shine. After letting the chair sit for a couple days in between coatings, it did not feel like there was ever a waxy buildup, and it feels like there is a strong protective coating. It is also very slick, I can see how other reviewers commented on using this wax on jointers and table saws. The next thing for the hubby to wax will be the table saw. We also will not hesitate to use this as a protectant on metal ornamentation, furniture, leather handles, or any other projects that require protection and a high gloss finish.
The first time the wife used it, she did not wear any gloves while applying the wax, and she complained afterwards how it made her hands feel. We would definitely recommend gloves.

Pros:
Amazing gloss

When the knife is sheathed, the finger guard protrudes from a notch in the side of the sheath. It seems natural to draw the knife from the sheath by putting your finger in front of the gaurd and pulling the knife out, but once the knife is unsheathed, your index finger now rest on a very sharp blade.  It seems obvious that you just would not do it anymore, but it is so instinctive to pull it out that way that you can hardly help from doing it. Since there are so many Mora's to choose from, maybe this review will encourage you to look at others.",Something to consider.

185602,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

156615,"Imagine a cross between a platform game and a pinball game and you have kirby tilt 'n tumble. This is like a platform game in that it is got many levels, obstacles, and there is always a boss in the endwhich is absurdly easy. However, to really enjoy the game, you go back to the old theory during the Atari's era: score as high as you can. This game has a surprising amount of depth, with many hidden areas to cash in on stars. The red stars are more difficult to get than regular stars, but when you get six, the red stars on the rest of the level become 1 UPs! I have gotten like about 50 lives this way. It is too easy if you play it like a platform. Instead, if you explore every nook and cranny of the levels, you will really get some nice rewards, not to mention the game's all too few minigames.

I have no idea why I had not noticed them before! At a fractional cost of the other blenders I mentioned, it is one of the best kitchen appliances I have ever purchased.

His personal desires in his 'perfect' victim and what he does to the victim is definitely creepy and slightly disturbing, which was obviously the authors intention and she very well succeeded.  However, the romance portion of the book was interesting.  I only wish that there had been a bit more physical interactions between the growing couple.  Without the extra heat, the book was more about the mind of a killer and his desires and not as much about the growing attraction.  An interesting read.",Interesting
218617,"Ordered this in January, 2012, but had no reason to use it until March, 2012, AFTER the expiration of the Worx 30 day satisfaction guarantee and the Amazon return period.

First time out, it shocked me every time I touched it anywhere near an assembly screw.  It does not vacuum that well.  The reviewer who said it works okay if you only have a few leaves to vacuum is absolutely right.  I would add to that:  If you also have a lot of time to waste.  To be fair, they were cottonwood leaves, quite large, but dry and loosely piled against a wall by the wind.  I gave up after 11/2 bags.  I was worried about electrocution.

I called Worx customer service about the shock and also mentioned that it does not pick up leaves as well as is shown in the video.  They are sorry I do not like the performance, but I missed the window for the satisfaction guarantee.  Fair enough.

As to the electrical shocks, they suggested wearing gloves while operating the product.  They blamed static electricity.

For some reason, Worx is sending a replacement motor unit under the two year warranty, but since they do not expect it to change anything, it seems pointless.  Never buy on Amazon unless you can test the product in the 30 day return period.  I say that as someone who buys a lot on Amazon and should know better.

Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed the story and finally seeing Mare's saga come to an end. But I felt it was rushed and not well thought out like the other books. Without giving spoilers, it was very anticlimactic. I am disappointment and sad. I hope the author decide to write another giving us closure. This book left so much in the open. I was craving Mare and Cal's energy and love. It was just disappointing...I just cannot go any further without ruining it with spoilers.

This is a slightly cheaper version of the Koala Kare stations that you might have seen everywhere. And, while I like the Koala Kare stations a bit more, this is great for the business that cannot or does not want to invest that much money.

162682,"I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first, but I think personally I would about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I will remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I did not play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and could not afford to get it wrong on the first try. I will try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I will remember to pay attention to the sugar.

184717,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

The program's support for RAW format images seems to be good  it handles RAW from my Nikon D300 and D3x without problems, although the large files that come from my D3x seem to take a long time to process. A fast computer and lots of memory help.

Assuming good basic technique, the images come out amazingly well. Although the basic idea is to stitch together images taken with different exposures, sometimes it is handy to use the program's tone mapping capabilities, even on a single image.

I tend to start my workflow with Photomatix, outputting HDR TIF images that I usually bring back into an editing program PhotoShop for further tweaking. Photomatix is good at HDR  you still need something else for many of the other changes you might want to make to your images.

This is one reason to upgrade from an earlier edition to this one right there. You can handle bigger photos and more all at the same time and you can edit them with great rapidity.

The format has changed from the last version and there are a lot of new or enhanced features. The Smart Selection Brush is awesome! And other features like Object Remover and Smart Carver seem to be easier to use.

Of course, there are going to be new features to learn and getting used to the new format was bit awkward for me. But, one of my favorite features, helps with all of this and that is that they ""learning videos"" that help you figure out how to use the new and enhanced tools that come with this software.

Using a broom takes forever and makes you sweat like crazy. Regular vacuum will not go under the booths and too loud. This shark is perfect. The head swivels around poles and the handle bends so you can get into places and under things without having to bend over. Picks up the crumbs and big things like crayons with ease. It even sucked up a glove half way into the vacuum cleaner and I had to pull it out. Takes me just a couple of minutes to clean under the tables and I can use it when there are still customers because it is very quiet. I vacuum at home almost every day now because it is always there ready to use without having to plug it in and very super light to carry up the stairs. Vacuuming is almost fun with this Shark.,Absolutely in love!! Vacuuming is almost fun with this Shark.

Camera controls  Are so bad and frustrating that you will want to drop the controller 1 hour into the game.

Health and stamina  Do not pick up a health or stamina drink unless you NEED it. They are not stored even though you can store tons of huge items. Once you pick it up, it is used. They are pointless anyway because my health meter never changed once even though I found 2 health drinks in a row.

Weapons  Yeah they break. Usually while you are still using it and then trying to change weapons has a delay which means you get hit if you try to equip another. If you have a large weapon in your hand and they attack first, you lose that weapon. You do not DROP it, you lose it forever.
If you are a diehard fan, you will get used to this game and play it thru.

184373,"Anyone who thinks they do not have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That does not even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they do not separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent.",Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning

50456,"I decided to look at benchmarks for two new Samsung microSD cards and I looked at them against the same quality and capacity for a PNY microSD card.

The first card is the Samsung 64 GB ""Evo Select"" which is a higher performing card with a maximum Read speed of 80MB/ sec and a maximum Write speed of 20 MB/sec.

The other card is Samsung's Premium card, the ""Pro Pro Performance"" card and this one is a 32 GB card all of them ""Class 10"" card.  The Pro has a stated maximum READ speed of 90 MB/sec and a maximum WRITE speed of 80 MB/sec.   This is quite a jump from 20 MB/sec to 80 MB/sec.

Both cards were tested against the PNY which has a stated, maximum READ speed of 90 MB/sec with no stated WRITE speed.

A good app to test out your microSD cards is ""A1 SD Bench""

 The Results 

PNY 64 GB

REASadness 63.7 MB/ sec.
WRITE: 28.24 MB/ sec.

Samsung ""Evo Select"" 64 GB

REASadness 67.41 MB/ sec.
WRITE: 23.68 MB/ sec.

Samsung ""Pro"" 32 GB

REASadness 62.86 MB/ sec.
WRITE: 27.52 MB/ sec.

The better of the two Samsung cards, I would have to say is the ""Evo Select"" although, I would be satisfied with any of the the three.  I am really most surprised that the PNY card held its own against Samsung.",MicroSD Card Shootout!

159967,"I got the camera because I always get everything with a new launch. However, there is not much to do with the camera so far. They PS4 comes installed with a few mini games, but after a hour playing it all you most likely will not ever go back to it.  The quality of the camera was not as sharp as I thought it was going to be, but I do have a 60inch, so maybe my screen is too big? I do not know I was just expecting High Definition.

It just started doing voice commands. So you can say ""Playstation"", then ""Killzone"", then you can start it. Turn off the system with your voice. Just real simple things. When you first turn on the PS4 you can have it recognize your face. But the camera has to pick up the light bar on the controller and you have to have good lighting for it to work. It is just easier to click on the user.

The camera comes with a neat little rubber think that can bend and hang onto the top of your television. Other than that it is just a camera with no real games for it. I think Just Dance came out, but from what I read, the game is not that good with the camera at all, so if you do not get that game, the camera will be collection dust until something else comes. Hopefully there will be more games to come, but there is no rush into getting it.","Meh, you can wait"

I have several pairs of clog type shoes most in Merrell or Keen brands so heavier shoes. i was looking for a lighter pair and for that they fit the bill. However I think they are a bit too thin. The material is very light/thin almost to the point where I will not wear them until spring time which is a shame.
The shoe feels ok on my foot. It is light but the arch support is not there. I guess I am use to ones with better support inserts that these were just well flat. The soles are very light and thin, so there is not much impact. I am not running in them or anything but I feel like if I had to jump I would feel the entire impact in my foot.

I have sesnoiditis and have a pretty bad bunion on the same foot. I have to wear comfy shoes at all times with good support. These shoes fit the comfy part to a T. However the support is lacking so much that I can only wear them for short periods of time.
I would suggest them only to people that do not require a lot of arch support.",I was hoping for clouds

184182,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

I have been using Corel Video Studio 12 which is a simple program that does just what I need it to do.

This is a oneyear subscription to Office 365, which can be installed on one PC/MAC and one tablet/phone.

This includes all the standard office products: Word, Excel, OneNote, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook.

The only office product available for Android is OneNote. This used to be one of my favorite office products, but it is been really crippled by the move to integrate it across platforms. It is not nearly as flexible as it used to be. In the desktop version you can still create section groups, but they will not sync with the mobile version. You also cannot add more space to pages the way you used to.

The other office products work as well as ever. I wish at least Word was available for Android, though. I guess Microsoft wants to push people toward their mobile OS, though.

I am not a huge fan of subscription software in general. When I buy something, I want it to be mine. I did not like having to setup a Microsoft account to use the software. I have been using OpenOffice for a long time and I do not anticipate fully switching to the Microsoft products. For one thing, the subscription runs out in a year. Also, I feel OpenOffice protects my privacy a lot better.

If you have to have office, then you have to have office. It Access and PowerPoint are definitely worth the price of the software, also.",Okay

180585,"Just a heads up: as noted in other reviews here, these run about a size smaller than listed. I ordered a couple different colors in XL, the size I normally wear, but it fits like a L instead and will likely be relegated to home wear only; I do not have a lot of desire to subject others to my beer belly finely framed in a tootight shirt so it looks like I am smuggling a basketball. They will have their uses: something to throw on for aroundthehome chores, second layer in the winter, something for my cat to lay on, etc. Order one size up, and then if that is too large start a return and go smaller. In fact, I may just take my own advice and exchange for 2XL.","Thick, but seems to run a size small"
63234,"I am a little concerned about what it says about me that I read this kind of book.  I am not sure why reading the gory, graphic doings of a violent serial killer is considered entertainment.  But I have read the entire Beauty Killer series.  All five of them.  And I watch Dexter too....  Hmmm......

Anyway, if your character is similarly flawed, you will enjoy this series.  You must read the books in order though.  In my opinion they are not intended to stand on their own as they tell an evolving story of Gretchen beautiful psychopath and Archie detective caught in her web.  This installment of the story moves with breakneck pace, reveals some history that explains some of Gretchen's motivation and is spiced up with great side characters.  I could see a Susan spinoff series!!!

My only complaint about this series is that I just do not buy how Archie keeps being under Gretchen's spell.  He shows some signs of having broken free in ""Kill You Twice"" but you get the distinct feeling that she is still pulling the strings even when she is incarcerated.  I would like him to wake up once and for all and do her in.  He is a strong enough character he could carry the series beyond Gretchen.

46352,After reading about the many producers who worked on this album I was afraid this offering might turn out to be a hodgepodge release. Far from it. Almost all of the songs are great and even the melodically not so strong offerings are saved by the musical ideas and the brilliant production. Everybody who has ears must be aware that Paul's voice is not perfect anymore  but come on! He ruined it by singing songs like Oh Darling! Helter Skelter or Why Do Not We do It on The Rod? for US. For 'Early Days' his ragged voice is just perfect and because of the great music he just keeps coming up with he gets away this time again.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I could not really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15years ago  I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small  there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own athletic, heel, boot.  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me an inch or less, I do not want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc..

108729,"Stepmom is definitely NOT your usual cliche'd movie about divorce and how it affects the children involved; it is MUCH, MUCH more!  Emotions run high throughout the film and the bitter tension, jealousy, and friction between  the characters is so strong it is almost palpable!  The acting in this movie  is excellent; the dialogue is so believable, that you almost feel like  you are evesdropping on real people's lives!  My opinion?  If you have not  seen this movie yet  you REALLY, REALLY should!  Just be sure to have a  box of tissues handy.  You are going to need them!",THIS MOVIE PACKS AN EMOTIONAL WALLUP!
12489,"Wearing glasses and wanting your eyes to pop I need to use eye shadow and mascara. Having sensitive eyes and removing that eyeshadow and mascara is another subject.several of the other eye make up remover left a residue that made my eyes sting.

I used this eye make up remover judiciously, shaking the bottle well as instructed,  taking a small amount in a cotton ball and applying it to my eye. One or two swipes did the trick, my mascara and eye shadow came completely off. There was no residue at all. This is primarily made for waterproof makeup which I do not use. It is paraben free.

We were also able to put ABCmouse.com app on here and amazon instant video which was really nice.  But now sadly a year later it is not all it is cracked up to be.  We have gone through 3 of the chargers that come with this tablet, the micro USB connecter is just too fragile I have since started using a different brand and works a lot better.  Sometimes I have to hold the power button down for a whole minute for it to turn on even after fully charging it.  This is just annoying.  Worst of all, the games we bought from leapfrog and downloaded freeze up constantly or give an error message and will not play.  I would not buy another one of these and would not recommend it.

76813,"I carry it to keep my cell juiced all day without tethering myself to a wall socket.  For that this device is ideal.  You can charge while moving and it is just big enough to keep track of without being too big like the larger capacity ones from this company.

I have owned this device about a month but only posted the review yesterday.  Now, the following day I knock off a star because apparently after a three foot fall to a floor the battery does not work.  Not a huge issue and I will buy another but...if you are clumsy, maybe not one as heavy as this one is a better choice.

If you are on the go, do not get this one.

I received this book in exchange for an honest review by the Author and the Lovers of Paranormal Group on Goodreads.com
This is a brilliant  book that I absolutely loved.
Ghost Hold is the second book in the PSS Chronicles series and picks up a few weeks after Ghost Hand ended...and so the tale of Olivia Black and the kids with PSS  Psyche Sans Soma  continues. This book has well crafted elements of mystery and intrigue and will keep you guessing until the very end.  The plot is excellent, and very well thought out.  The style of writing is rich and descriptive and flows well, making the book an easy read.  The characters are well described and true to life.  This book is a real page turner that will have you hooked until the very end.  If you love books with a Supernatural theme, then you will enjoy this one.

169438,"I won this book in a contest and I was not sure what to expect.

It was so delightful.  A Romantic Paranormal Comedy!

Damian, a drop dead pun intended gorgeous vampire, won the vote of a leading magazine amongst the supes as the most eligible bachelor.  He thought he would like the attention, but discovered that he hates each new encounter with a lust filled female.  Its even interfering with his work and daily life.  Only his best friend, Jo, a troll, can ease his tension.  Damien comes to his best friend for solace, camaraderie, and a moviewatching partner.

The plot was cute, the little world about Mysterious lane was fun, and the main characters were endearing.  I laughed out loud several times and felt so sorry for Jo at times watching all those females come on to Damien and having to deal with him being oblivious to her feelings for him.  Loved how the scenes are simple and everyday.

My only complaint is that it was too short.  I loved hanging out with Damian and Jo.

43402,"Tull was a controversial band back in the 70's.  Were they a rock band at all?  Were they even a prog. rock band like Yes and Floyd?  Or were they something totally unclassifiable?  With an enigmatic leader, Ian Anderson, they have some of the biggest hits ever, Aqualung and Locomotive Breath,  both with plenty of radio play, and followed up that success with two albums that had only one song each Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, both which strangely became 1 albums how is that possible?.  Then in 1977, after a couple of other very successful albums, they popped out Songs From the Wood.  This album rocks in a real woodsy sort of way. The title track sounds great on the remastered version, especially the vocals.  Hunting Girl is a real standout too.  This album stands as a musical work that will never go out of style.

UPDATE 3/5/11 ... I bought this item just before Christmas. Everything was great til about a month ago. Now, I cannot charge either of the two batteries while inserted in the phone.

 To be clear, I have to take the battery out and charge it in the charger itself because when I try when it is in the phone, it gives me a weird message saying the battery is not connected, but physically, it is. My OEM battery does not have this problem. I am befuddled as to why it is doing this. However, the charger charges the batteries fine, the light still changes color when they are full and they show a full charge when popped into the phone, thus I give it three stars for only being a partial pain in the a.

I should also add that the company offers you a token amazon gift card if you review their product after you buy it; I do not know if they still do that but it might count for a lot of premature 5 star ratings.","Update! Less than 3 months into use, Will ONLY charge in charger OUTSIDE of phone"

I was a bit surprised at just how short this story is.  For some reason I was expecting something a bit longer, more of a novella.  This really is a short short story, emphasis on short.  You can finish it in about 20 minutes.  Based on the description on Amazon, I was expecting the story to start with humans exploring the solar system and finding the wormships.

I like the fact that its light not heavy, and that you can pull or push the accordion folds to expand or contract at will.  Fittings look high quality.  This is probably not top of the line, but neither is the price.  The sky is the limit on how high you can go on quality, but frankly, this is more than adequate for now.

I plan to eliminate the pesky business of doing your business altogether, by switching to a $950 composting toilet at some point next year.  If you watch Gone with the Wynns on Utube, they recommend a composting toilet unit, which does not smell, never needs to be flushed out, and is much more sanitary and earth friendly.  In fact, we should install those in every home as well.

184235,"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

But, thanks to Michael's generosity, he is giving away some of his works and this is your chance to fill that gap in your reading library.

This is an excellent introduction to his fantasy world of Elan and the charismatic duo  exassassin, Royce Melborn and exsoldier/mercenary, Hadrian Blackwater. They are for hire and their working title is Riyria.

The three stories here are stand alone, enjoyable reads and there is an introduction to the next Riyria novel which is still in beta but should be published sometime in December.

This is a free download so you lose nothing but time spent enjoying these short exploits of Riyria.",Excellent!!!

11670,"This is a leavein hair conditioner so a little goes a very very long way.

After shampooing, spread a very tiny peasized amount in your hands and apply to damp toweldried hair focusing on the ends working towards the scalp. Avoid actually putting any on your roots or your scalp to avoid weighing your hair down.  If there is not enough product, repeat again in tiny peasized increments.  Style as usual.

I love this particular leavein conditioner not only because it plays well with heat and dryers but also because it is equally effective at smoothing frizz without help.  I have combination Eurasian hair: my mother's Asian dead straight and fine hair plus my dad's curls so I end up with a somewhat frizzy messylooking crop with its own mind.  My hair's personality varies with humidity and since products meant for curly hair weighs it down due to the straight bits and straight hair products just don;t cut it, I am always in search of something in between that will work. This product seems to be the perfect solution to my combination hair woes. It leave my hair frizzfree and silky to touch without weighing it down.","Smooth, shiny and silky. reduces frizz without the weight"

Other than that, the movie is very well done,if slightly predictable to those who have seen more than three or four thrillers. Still, its very suspenseful, and will keep you engaged the whole way through. My biggest props go to Jodie Foster, who is excellent as always. In fact she is so good in this movie that the other actors all seem diminished somehow. She just makes them look like they are standing still, with the exception of Sean Bean who turns in a great performance as well.

39691,"This cd is a vast improvement over Forty Licks and is truly career spanning. This is the Greatest Hits cd we have all wanted for a long time now. But I have noticed in the reviews here that the songs are described as being in chronological order and this is simply not true. They are in relatively chronological groups but the order is not the order in which they were released. It would take up too much space to give examples, but very little of it is in truly chronological order. If you want to, look it up on Wikipedia or another music site. I am not being a nitpicker here though it may seem so. Anybody who went wild for the Stones in 1964 and grew up with all these songs knows their real order and for many reasons would usually want to hear them that way. They the label,not the group came close this time but no cigar. The thing is the songs are on the right disc together; would it have been too much to arrange them correctly? And must there always be the ""one missing song"" on so many hits collections? Would it have been that impossible to include Mother's Little Helper  and really, Lady Jane belongs here too. Was there no Summer of 1966? But at least they included the nearly lost and forgotten We Love You from the late summer of 1967. Oh well, at least it is the computer age and we can rearrange things. And despite my griping, it is The Stones in all their glory in one of the greatest careers in music history. Get it!",Great music but not really chronological

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I am glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fistsized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is freeflowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip  when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It is way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they are so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you will have a MUCH easier time.",Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line.

The benefit of these spices is they can add a lot of heat without altering the flavor too much like adding pickled jalapeos does.  The ghost peppers are good but can be easily over done.  With the Habanero flakes you do not have as high a chance of getting 'hot spots', places that get a few flakes where other bites had no flakes.  That happens with the Ghost Peppers.  But with the Ghost Peppers a little bit goes a long way, so the whole container will last a long time.  At this rate between the two containers, eating them almost every day I can expect them to last maybe a couple years.  It is a great value.

47370,"A lot has been written about these sonatas and their various interpretations.  So, it is only with a certain level of apprehension that I write some more.  This is also due to my general reluctance to comment on music, something whose sublime is equaled mostly by the subjectivity of individual perceptions.

Once premises have been established, allow me to say it here as well, ""Beethoven was just like you and I, only that much more.""  To the extent these words ring true to you, then we can agree that Beethoven's music is about LIFE.  Having listened to so many complete cycles of these sonatas, I would only say that it took a Californian in London to render these masterpieces lifelike.  Indeed, Kovacevich comes the closest of all to revealing the liferange encompassed by these works.  Too bad we cannot learn what had informed Kovacevich's interpretationwas it his own life, Beethoven scholarship, or what?

As for the critics of this interpretation, most of them are probably right, in their own ways.  However, what are those ways relative to LIFE itself?  Noise!","What is, possibly rightful, criticism of this edition relative to LIFE itself?  Noise!"

185130,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

12285,"Honestly, I have purchased some incredibly saturated longlasting lipsticks for less, as well as for more, and have come to the conclusion that I would rather pay less. Is this a good lipstick? Sure! It applies smoothly and easily, has a beautifully matte finish, and tends to mostly stay in place. It is not as opaque as I would like, slightly sheer and more stainlike than a traditional lipstick. I was hoping for something thicker.

Because it was more like a stain, it also had the advantage of staying fairly consistent in its appearance and not coming off easily. I only had to reapply once in the span of my day, and the color looked beautiful.

All in all, I will keep my cheap ones that are probably leadfilled and horrible and need reapplication, because they look thicker and come in some wild colors, but if you have extra money and do not know where to find the awesome offbrand stuff, this is also really nice and has an almost powdery silken finish. Very nice!","more like a matte stain, silky powdery finish"

97279,"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I do not think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with OralB Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I cannot say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I do not want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing ...

170448,"This story was well rounded and most of the characters were individually created to be separate throughout this science fiction book.  The author has a good grasp of story telling and I found it fascinating to follow through the pages and learn about Titan ""dust.""  I do not tell the story in my reviews.  Unfortunately, I give a 4 because of the distracting parts that showed me it needed editing and someone missed a lot of typos, duplicated words, missed words and misspelled words.  As far as the story goes, the main character, David Carpenter, known by the neat nickname of Carp, reminded me of Han Solo in his mannerisms and characterization and it made me smile to visualize him going through the stunts, thoughts and piloting the ships.

To overprovision an SSD drive go to Disk Management in Windows. Select your SSD partition Usually C. Right Click on it and select shrink volume. Use a value that gives you at least 25GB of free space. More is better but 25GB is the minimum. I would really recommend that you use 50. Now create a new partition in the free space you created and quick format it. Disable the power saving features that put the ocmputer to sleep and let it sit idle for a few hours so the TRIM process can complete on the OP partition. After it has sat for a few hours right click on the new partition and click Delete Partition. Leave it as unallocated space.

Set between the gorgeous but isolated Greek Islands and the metropolis of London, this is a tale of romance and self discovery. This novel had the light fun feeling of chick lit as well as being grounded in reality. As well as the drama of organising a big wedding in a short amount of time, while trying to keep everyone happy, this novel also tactfully dealt with deeper issues such as the economic climate and refugee crisis. I found the characters likable and enjoyed the writing style. I plan to read more of Samantha's work.

The metal she will gives this product a heftier feel over Western Digital's other My Book products that are usually made with flimsier plastic cases. It will make full use of the USB 3.0 ports found on newer Macs but will still function on older Macs that have slower USB 2.0 connections.

On my Macbook Pro with Retina Display, the My Book delivered read and write speeds of about 150 megabytes per second using a video performance test from Black Magic Design.  This is on par with a similar Thunderboltbased drive I tested from Seagate last month. It is certainly more than adequate for most desktop computer tasks and will make for an excellent Time Machine backup drive.

If you are using this as a backup drive I would suggest buying two. The reason being is that it is always a good practice to have your important data stored off site in addition to an onsite backup. Mac OS X supports multiple Time Machine drives making it very easy to maintain a good offsite backup strategy.

Other than that this is a very simple hard drive that just plain works. No need to install any software or configure it. Plug it in and it is ready to go.","Fast, Well Built, and It Just Works"

66596,"This book opened my eyes about parenting adult children and helped me understand the dynamics between my adult daughters and me.  I do not have major issues with my children, but I felt hurt perhaps because they grew up and I felt that I was no longer important in their lives.  My role changed from ""indispensable mommy"" to a casual consultant in regards to making decisions in my children's lives.  The transition to parent young children to adult children feels to me like being demoted from captain of the ship to petty officer third class... but this book helped me understand that dynamic and finally I understood that my role might have changed but never the love between my children and I.  I really recommend this book, not only if parents are having issues with their adult children, but even before any issues arise and just to help understand the dynamics between parents and adult children.",Great book to help understand your grown-up child.

89846,"This stove has had mixed reviews in the light and ultralight backpacking community. Common concerns are the various pivot points/joints and the very thin adjuster. As with most ultralight gear, if you take care of this stove it will hold up just fine.
It sits a bit lower than similar MSR stoves, which is a plus I think. It fits well with a 600750 ML pots, but not much bigger. The flame pattern is sufficient for boiling water but it would be a challenge to cook or simmer with it.
Bottom line, if you want the lightest gas canister stove out there and you mainly just boil water on the trail, this is your stove. It weighed in at .87 oz on my scale. It is worth it even if you have to take extra care to handle it well on the trail.",Great ultralight option!

88349,"Let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of Hogue grips.  I like everything about them.  However, for pistols with an alreadythick grip, an aftermarket Hogue grip ""glove"" is not necessarily the best solution.  Therefore, I am glad I read the reviews here before I proceeded to purchase a Hogue for my Glock 19.  This Pachmayr was definitely a better choice.  The bottom of the grip is just above the bottom of the pistol's grip, so there is no overhang.  Installing was also very easy.  It gives you just a little better cushion, which has helped me control the pistol a little better.

It is important to note: I did buy a Hogue grip for my Glock 21SF.  For that pistol, the Hogue is the better choice, in my opinion.  It is considerably harder to ""install"", but in the end, I am happy I made the effort.",The right aftermarket grip for this pistol

But after a while I began to take notice of which picks felt right versus which ones did not and I began to single out my favorites. I had settled on Fender mediums as my pick of choice yet felt they could be better. After all, you take an aggressive song with a couple good pick slides in it and your Fender pick looks like Jethro's gaptoothed grin and the edge is completely worn away.
 Once I discovered the Dunlop Delrin picks, I have not used another brand or style. Simply because they were exactly what I was looking for. Just enough resistance to keep the string attack clean and enough flexibility to keep the pick firmly within your grasp. The materials from which the Delrins are made offers superior wear resistance. Greater wear resistance  longer life  using fewer picks. I used to go one or two songs and need a new pick. Now one pick lasts me an entire rehearsal.

44419,"Thirty Three and 1/3 is George Harrison's first LP on his own Dark Horse label.  It comes after a good many months of personal ordeal.  Harrison made a concert tour with a show that mirrored The Concert for Bangladesh.  EastWest music.  All the top Indian musicians opened the show, and then George and his band took over after the intermission. A bright highlight of the tour was a visit to the White House, as the guest of Jack Ford, son of Gerald Ford, President.  This was perhaps the first visit to the White House by a Beatle.
 About half way though the tour his voice was thrashed.  He became sick with jaundice.  To fulfill his EMI contract, he recorded Extra Texture Read All ABout It, where he even made a joke at his own expense Ohnothimagain, Oh, not him again.  His wife left him for Eric Clapton.  Drank a good amount of brandy. However his association with A  M Recordswhich was the parent company of Dark Horse Records BEFORE Warner Brothers Records took it under its wing, brought about his meeting Olivia Trinidad Arias, whom he married and had a son, Dhani.
 So, this album represents a George whose life had just gone from the lower depths, to heaven, in just a matter of months. Other reviews have already given a good detailed description of the tracks on this album, so I will not try to duplicate those efforts here.
  One of the photos that accompanied the original album art was one of Harold Harrison Sr., George's father, with George, posing outside Friar Park.  George had his father, as well as his brother Pete, residing with him on his estate in Henley on Thames, just outside London.  Pete stills resides there to this day. 12/06",The George We Love

Ni Cads will be dead, and may never charge correctly if you leave them sitting for a year. I looked into buying Lithiumion replacement batteries several years ago, but they were so expensive that I got an entire set of Makita lithiumion tools and 3 batteries for less than a hundred more than the Milwaukee batteries and charger would have cost, so when I saw these, I jumped on them. I like my Makita, but I like my old tried and true Milwaukee as well, and am very glad to have it back in service again. Prices fluctuate, but these were a really good deal when I bought them, and if you want to use your older Milwaukee tools, these are great. I have had them for several years now, they hold up, and have more a$$ than my Makita's do even thought they are supposed to be the same amp hours. Milwaukee has been sold and sold, and I understand sold again since I purchased mine, I am not sure the newer tools are as good as the older ones, so I would not take the gamble, I would upgrade the batteries if you are torn between new batteries and a new set of Milwaulkee tools.",Great way to go!

Interesting note: I have one USB cable that will not charge at more than 150 ma, which would take 10 hours to charge the phone.  Another cable does it at nearly 1000 ma about the rating of the wall wart.  The first must be a data only cable, which only allows a token charge.

162458,"After 4 years I finally called it quits with the Every Day magazine. The magazine has changed in size, layout, and target audience to the point where I feel I am NOT that demographic. The magazine has become aimed at the more wealthy members of society. The recipes are a bit repetitious or made with ""one shot"" ingredients, i.e. expensive ingredients that are hard to find. Ingredients used once then you are stuck with something you will never use again.

I am really disappointed to see Rachael Ray go off on tangents about her expensive vacations. It is disheartening to see her monthly product page filled with items like jeans that cost $150. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the magazine, but I do feel ostracized by recipes I cannot afford to make or that include ingredients so unique that making the recipe costs a lot of money. Sorry, Rachael.  My budget has no room for you now. I love recipes, but yours have become too far off course.",No Longer For The Ordinary Person

70944,"In this book Rawles does a great job of training the troops for the end of the world. I do not know how anyone would have enough money in today's economy to actually do half of the things on the lists in this book, but it is a good guide. Buying a hideaway and equipping it like a fortress is beyond most people's means and the weapons and ammo, bunkers to hide it and keep it from rust and vehicles that would survive an EMP are really costly. This lifestyle would require that you form a cell of like minded people who would train as military combatants, learn home medical and surgery techniques and share in the cost of setting all this war fortress and cashes up and maintain them through years of normalcy, like the bomb shelters of the 1960s. If I had several millions of dollars I would love to set this up. There is some solid advice in this and other books by Rawles on not putting all your eggs in one basket, having some gold and silver as monetary backup and having some firearms for self protection. I would recommend the book to everyone for the survival information whether you can afford to do all the things he suggests or not.",Great book for how to survive

139028,"UPDATE  Since fixing the oring seat and damaged section of hose from the oring, I have managed to get this thing to work a lot better.  I have found that if you put the coolant tank as high as possible it will pull enough of a vacuum and actually produce a decent mist.  I was able to put my coolant tank above the nozzle head, and it has consistently been working now.  However, if I put the coolant tank as far below the nozzle as the hose will allow, it will not pull a consistent vacuum, and thus the mist will be intermittent at best.

I do some detail carbide and diamond drilling in glazed ceramics and glass, so I was hoping to use this to keep the drills cool, while pulling the coolant back up from the drilling catch basin.  This does not really work.

It barely pulls any vacuum to make a mist unless you cut out the damaged section from their poor oring setup clamping down too hard on the tube and remachine and reseat everything.  Even then you have to run it at an absurd pressure, over 90PSI for me, to get it to pull anything.  At 90PSI every air fitting joint leaks.  I tested this with pure water, no cutting additives at all.

Fortunately for me, I only wanted it for the air nozzle and not the mist feature, but someone that expects a proper vacuum mist system will be disappointed. Even only wanting it for the air nozzle, it is fairly marginal at best.","Meh for Mist, OK for Air"

It does not have the texture of a cream which surprised me, but I love how it feels on the skin. The next morning your skin is soft and supple.

212972,"Having worked with, and studied the Dramatica theory of story development, and also looked at and read a few of the examples it is based on, it seems to me that Dramatica 4 is a product somewhat ahead of itself.
By this I mean, that to convey the principles of Dramatica the prior art examples are  either too archetypical with no real requirement for the use of Dramatica by those who intend writing such archetypes, or are too flawed so that they do Dramatica no favours due to them being little more than the nearest point of common reference.
But by treating Dramatica as a philosophy and an abstraction, and not using it to see how prior art can be aligned to its principles, one can quickly see how Dramatica will enable the writer to create stories and forms hitherto unattainable, simply  because the organisation of the story's elements and form would have been too difficult to keep track of.
Therefore, in order to get the desired results from using Dramatica, the user has to gain expertise in the way of defining and structuring a story's elements with Dramatica, and not be trying to defend the outcome on prior art which is a close call. This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably does not exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica.
Now there is a chicken or the egg paradox.",Ahead of the curve.
115989,"This movie is great. It is sickeningly disturbing and a great movie that twists your mind. It is a movie where it expounds on the life of a rich wallstret suck up who is going insane, and indeed does crack a little. With a surprising, believable twist, with Ptrick Bateman played by Christian Bale going on a murder spree. No plot spoilers here, what I said was in the trailers.

The sad, miserable life of this rich man finally empties his soul of what little emotion he had left, where he vents his frustrations on his assistant and on unwitting victims.

Watch the movie to see the suck up go from polite to maniacal. A little too disturbing for my tastes, some parts seemed sad because Christian Bale plays such a supreme performance. I never thought I would have pity for a rich person, let alone a murderer.

Also, they do not have a lot of nudity. What they show are a few porn scenes but with literally one or two butt and boob shots that are about a split second, but I swear they let your imagination FLY. Man. The power of the mind.",he's a psycho

My least favorite would be the orange mango because it gives me a slight aftertaste of what I imagine that Orange Clean hand cleaner tastes like. I was a little disappointed with pomegranate juice and cranberry juice because the cranberry is too strong to taste the pomegranate.

We still have our goggles. I have read some reviews that said they leak. It is very important for for all goggles, not just these, but for all, for you to clean the goggles after you use them. Especially after swimming in a chlorinated pool. I spoke to our kids swim instructor my kids go to year round swim lessons and she suggested rinsing them after swimming. I noticed with our first pair that after awhile they would leak and I had to buy another one. After rinsing very well every time the kids swam the new pair it has lasted us 4 years. Very happy!



I like these much better than the regular speedo goggles. They do not squish my kids eyes and they actually like wearing goggles now. It is very easy to change the fit of the goggles to have it fit your child. You just pulled the string in both directions and there you go. When my children were first learning how to swim, I had them in the regular speedo goggles. They hated putting those on and complained about how it would squish their eyes. I finally found these on Amazon after seeing another kid wearing them at the pool. Now my kids are happy and love to swim and to see underwater too!",No more squishy eyes! And an UPDATE.

77166,"This is a review for a 7800 powerpack.
Relatively heavy, but seems all battery chargers are heavy.
I liked a lot its feature of showing the exact percentage of charge left.
Became really useful during my trip to Peru, when I could not get to the power supply any time I wanted.
It took 1 hour and 55 minutes to charge the powerpack from 35 to 57.
Charging Ipad 2  added 38 from 62 to 100Drunk or confused in 3 hours and 30 minutes.
For Iphone 5 it needed 1 h and 20 minutes to add 65 from 35 to 100Drunk or confused.
PNY itself drained from 100 to 35 after these efforts.
I have not used it very often, and it may get pretty efficient with multiple uses, but it falls short of the performance it is advertised for as are pretty much all the battery chargers. Still, I guess you can get 1 full charge for a tablet and 1 full charge for a phone iphone5 in my case. I am not sure if I have used it for a phone only too heavy for that, and there are lighter and more convenient chargers, including charging cases, for phones  unless you think that you will be out for a while and need to charge the phone several times. It is great for a tablet, though.","Acceptable size, enough charge for a tablet"

I wish it was a little bit thicker like my old travel pillow not memory foam, but overall it is very comfortable. The eye shade is nice, but like some others have posted, you can still see light through the nose area if you put them on and open your eyes. But at least when your eyes are closed it is nice and dark unlike having your eyes closed when the lights are on without a mask. The ear plugs are too firm and seem to pop out once I put them in.

203015,"First off, this is a very capable scan tool for a wide range of cars. I am not an auto shop so it is hard for me to fully evaluate the full range of capabilities. The solid side of the tool is that it gives you an amazing amount of data and will allow you to tinker and discover issues with your system. The battery is not so good and you will want to ensure it is charged before you plan on using it. If you have a shop and want to use this on a daily basis, then leaving it plugged in at night is a must.

The other side to this machine, is that it is android powered. This is a good thing and a little bit of an issue. The good thing is that the platform is flexible enough to have add on capability as long as it will work with Android 4.4 and above. The bad side, is that I am not sure this device will ever actually be upgraded to 5 and above. As of today, the current android OS is at 7.1

This may be fine for the near future, but at some point down the not so distant future, it will no longer be supported. Good for having folks re buy the item very few years, but not so good for the end user.

Its for garden use only, not for construction. Unless you are 100 sure all the lumber has no nails.

DO NOT  use this for demolishing works. Its not designed and made for that.

For its intended use, the blade itself is designed to be a bit thicker than most saw blades,  so it has very low tolerance for side to side movement , it will break off at the base quite easily.

185738,"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so what is with the 3? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct does not have to many bends, and you want to take the risk maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke, you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats

Once I accepted it, it became amazingly unique. The tracks  are inspiring and beautiful, sad and tragic. The score, except for guitar  and the male voice is electronically orchestrated. It works beautifully,  this soundtrack is something you can always listen too, I love it  while  driving. A few of the tracks feature soulful male vocals, they are here to  accentuate the score. Overall the tracks are driving and pulsepounding,  with some quiet moments.

214237,"I have been fascinated with our family tree since I was little as part of the family was REALLY into researching ancestors.  Unfortunately, the one who promised to document everything and share decided to change their mind, so I am going to start fresh, and as a novice, this program is pretty helpful.

Please note that I have NOT used the free 3 months to Ancestry.com yet.  I want to get a little more done and explored on my own before I use that.

I had no problems installing the software or loading it.  I am making a point to regularly save a backup of my work, and when I am more comfortable and have a lot of time, I am going to really put that 3 month free access to Ancestry to work for me!

Meanwhile, there are some great video tutorials and a helpful book to help me along when and if I run into any issues.

The software makes it easy to work on your family tree, and so far I am having a great time simply talking to relatives and filling in what we know.  There are even places to save pictures and stories, as well as other documents.

This is really a great tool for a novice to work with.  Just remember to make sure you backup your work.",Family Tree Maker Deluxe: Helpful and Useful
172015,Cyndi Friberg writes fantastic scifi/paranormal books and Unique Ink is no exception.  The Shadow Assassins is one of my favorite series but as Cyndi is such a wonderful author I am never disappointed in any of her books.  I was truly captivated by Roxie and Elias' story and the interplay between them is electrifying making Unique Ink a definite must read!!!!!!!!!!,Highly Recommend - must check it out!!!

74799,"This was the second LG Enlighten I had to order this week, and I had issues with this one too. This phone was advertised as new, and when I receive the item it appeared to be new cosmetically. However, the battery to this so called new phone was clearly a USED battery. Since when do they sell new phones with USED batteries? Furthermore, the phone would freeze when I attempted to change the ringtone or notification tone. Nothing against the sellerBluTek USA other than the USED battery issue, but I am convinced that it is the phone itself and not the seller
 Hence, I give the phone 1 star and the seller 3 stars for the USED battery. Needless to say I returned it the same day I got it. The first LG Enlighten I ordered this was a defective refurbished phone. It would not charge fully and would power off constantly. Hope this helps.",Potential Buyers Please Read

139494,"LOST SCREW.  HELP!
It was bound to happen, and I am proud to say it took 2 years to lose it, but I lost the screw to the battery door on my Carrera Digital caliper.  I really hate to toss it out or hack it with tape.  Has anyone measured the screw size by any chance or has anyone found a screw for it?  Amazon has micro screw assortments but it sounds like they are mostly for computers, and therefore, far from 'micro' which does not help at all.  Does anyone have a source or a small set of assorted microscrews that might work?  I have tried different drill bits into the threaded hole itself as a 'go/nogo' gauge and it looks like 1.6mm is very close

When I received itvery fast by the way, I was equally impressed by the actual product in my hands.  I am not too worried about it not being waterproofnonsubmersible as I am very careful with all the cellphones I have ever owned anyway.  But, I am sure it will protect the phone in the rain as long as you do not let it get soaked.  As far as impact protection, this case will definitely provide enough protection as long as you do not intentionally slam it into the pavement.  The holster is really handy for clipping it to your vehicle's sun visor or fastening to your belt or back pack strap.  One of my favorite features is the built in screen protector  it really does not interfere with the touch sensitivity of the phone.

My main problem was I ordered this according to the measurements, and it comes with the laces tight but even so it was so large it fell off just trying it on. No way it would fit, I exchanged for a smaller size and that also fit way too large. It is even more beautiful in person and the pink fabric has a slight almost brocade pattern to it not a solid pink. the ""lace"" trim is gorgeous and so sweet.
It is an inconvenience to have to keep reordering to try to get a size that might fit and my worry is by the time the corset fits the lacing would have to be so open and with no modesty panel...If they had one I would for sure order the next size down and probably be happy as a vintage styled pony in clover.",Quite large fit

My budget and space limitations had to be considered when looking for a jointer. I wanted something that was portable, would last, suit my needs, but also not break the bank. I checked out the reviews on the Grizzly G0654 and they sounded promising, so I went ahead and ordered one.
The hardest part was contacting the shipper to arrange for lift gate service. Having to pay $34 extra to have someone get the jointer off the truck onto the ground seemed like BS to me, but it was a small price to pay.
 Cleaning all the cosmoline packing grease off was probably the most annoying part. A little laquer thinner did the trick. I had the jointer put together and running in about 3 hours. The outfeed table adjustment was pretty simple and the test pieces I ran through turned out great.

38582,"I tried to give Rick the benefit of the doubt here, but his selection of covers needed more consideration. I mean, most of the songs are ballads, and he does not improve upon the originals. I liked this album, but that is about it. I do not understand why Rick chose to remake songs almost identical to their originals. I really did not enjoy his version of The Dream Academy's ""Life In A Northern Town"" or Foreigner's ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"". I did not understand why he got Richard Page of Mr. Mister to redo ""Broken Wings"". I mean, why get the vocalist of the song to do the song again? His version of Human League's ""Human"" also failed. However, there was something likeable about his version of The Church's ""Under The Milky Way"" and John Lennon's ""Imagine"". The only original song, ""Cry"", cannot hold a candle to the other classics on the disc. Why is that Rick would do an album of covers not even two years after releasing his first album of original material in five years? All I can say is that I am glad he got this out of the way so he can move on to better things.","You,Too, Can Have Rick Sing At Your Wedding."

230160,"It has a strong petroleum smell.  But, it adheres to drywall extremely well.  Note: One can does not go very far.  I barely covered about 24 square feet with one can and I mean barely.  Plus, the nozzle began to clogup even though I was constantly shaking the can to keep it mixed.  If you get some overspray on something, wipe it up while it is still wet.  When this stuff dries, it is difficult to remove.  You have to scrape it off.  Other than that, it does what it is supposed to do.
Update:  I bought 4 cans.  Two cans worked okay.  On the third and 4th cans, the nozzle cloggedup immediately and the cans are unuseable.  The contents of the cans has become pasty like dried toothpaste, and clogs the nozzle.  Very frustrating.  Homax needs to redesign the nozzle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",It works well (when it works).

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project  was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you would not lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We did not lose any rods thankfully and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it is not convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",Does what it needs to

210167,"I have used this program for short films, and played around with examples for selfpublished book promos. I have played around somewhat with the special effects and animation capabilities, and I am happy.

As is expected from a budget program, this is not Adobe, and it is not blockbusterlevel studio quality. However, it is a solid, affordable program, and I have gotten good use out of it.

I really like the title and subtitle functions and effects it practically constitutes a program on its own! and the special effects are definitely something to be considered.

To put my review in perspective, I use this program with an athome green screen and manipulated photo stills to create a ""moving comic"" style of work classic comic in some cases, anime in others, real image/animation mishmash, and mine and my husband's personal art styles, and it absolutely excels at this. In conjunction with Corel's PaintShop Pro, I cannot ask for anything better in this price rangeand cannot ask for hugely better anywhere else.

For my needs, it is great. I cannot comment on featurefilm capabilities not quite there yet but I would imagine, if you know how to work it, it will yield similarly solid results, assuming you are not planning on creating the next ""Avatar.""

My biggest complaint is that it is not exactly intuitive. It is not impossible to figure out by any means, and compared to certain programs, it is an absolute cakewalk. I just get irate when I cannot learn a program in less than an hour.

That said, this is a nifty program. For smallerscale projects, it is fabulous.",A Little Complicated; Not Adobe; But Entertaining and Extremely Useful
